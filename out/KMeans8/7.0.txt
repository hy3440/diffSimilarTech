it sounds like the table is a lot larger than ram so this means something like 5555 disk reads -- likely to be the slowest part
if any parent has more children than there are parent the application crashes if any of the excess children are selected
please always try to use post method for submitting data as it is more secure than get method
if your goal is to eliminate certificate fingerprint warnings during push pull there s a better way to do this
in my original project there is more than one textbox for currency description textarea chekcbox etc
the bottom line is that decoding jpg is going to be slower than say png or gif
if you want to follow the spec then put says that the body is a representation of the url you put to while post is more general purpose
but note that while stateful isn t used much these days it usually makes more sense to opt-in for stateless sessionscope is much more universal and fits into nearly any session-based scenario
but if i give specific numbers for width and height it looks smaller or really huge but not the right dimension where its clear and is exactly same as what was clicked in camera or chosen in gallery
the parent establishes a stacking context and the children have higher z-index than the parent and cover the parent up so that s all fine
i recommend to take a look on tastypie which turned out to work even nicer than piston it helps you also with things like versioning your api and mamange multiple endpoints nicly
i have seen other people asking the same question why get method is faster than post
too bad that find calls often end up verbose â it s even worse with stl than with boost ranges
the subtraction case is going to require a little more work than addition in this code
it is the equivalent of a goto but is more restrictive in that labels may be used only in break or continue statements
so no big surprise zsh being better than bash
i m always having to tune the code for gcc g++ differences - usually the given version of g++ is just more limited in what it allows
the parent process always can keep track of its direct children easily as fork returns their id grand children gets more tricky ... and send a signal to any of its children on exiting gracefully
we ve recently switched from trac to redmine where i work and i think i like it a little more than trac and use the wiki functionality almost everyday
however i suspect i m having a larger issue with using objective-c interfaces with extensions in a swift project or my understanding of how that works
documentation provides more information than private protected public does and a good system will have documentation anyway
if you need to do something a set number of times a for-loop is generally more concise than a while loops
if almost all elements fail the filtering then it s considerably slower than just sorting everything since you ll end up selecting thousands of times
i need to add more than one textview and imageview in listitem and also i need to add header s at some random positions
however if this is indeed the case - and the data does not fit ram and you cannot use map-reduce i suspect sorting and iterating - though will be o nlogn will be more efficient using external sort - because the number of disk accesses will be minimized and disk access is much slower then ram access
when the data is in memory - you can do anything much faster on it since disk io is extremely slower then ram so sorting it and reading it multiple times is expected to be much slower then manipulating the data on memory
i haven t used it myself though as per this answer it s quite a bit more confusing than lisp scheme macros
my experience say that apc is nearly 7-8 times faster than memcached
while vimeo is more of a professional site youtube offers html5 h.264 video playback support for all videos so they ll play on iphone
however the tables are huge and the union all i read its faster than distinct takes forever to execute even with just two tables let alone 6
it seems some operators do better with post s than get s - this is a feeling i get from what some nigerian users mention
my impression common lisp is more for getting stuff done scheme is more for education and fun
with extra braces because multiplying has a higher precedence than add - assuming these are both percentage discounts
this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at raphael which is snaps older brother d3.js is very well established as well
silex seems to have a bigger community than slim maybe it s just my point of view
but certainly wrong syntax in the for-loop is there better way to code it so that after loops i can get
i am not aware of any device that can use api 14 with a screens density lower than hdpi
on the other hand you may want stable sorting in other contexts as well and so if you have the stable_sort function defined this approach would still be more straightforward than filtering out the numbers with each sign and recombining them
take a look at your picture - all the range you want have ending time greater than min and starting time less than max
union all will perform better than union when you re not concerned about eliminating duplicate records because you re avoiding an expensive distinct sort operation
what we can see is that regardless of raw hardware power google-chrome seems to run up to three times faster than edge and also significantly faster than firefox all updated to the latest verion
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry
innodb supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets
first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications
if you don t need to serialize raw pointers to things and instead either use c++11 style smart pointers or no pointers at all i d recommend using cereal as it supports pretty much everything in the standard library whereas boost has a more limited subset
i ve heard that rar decompression requires much more memory than zip decompression
almost any new cpu has more than one core or if it has just one it might support hyperthreading and thus pretending it has more than one
scalamock looks more natural when developing applications in scala however from what i read it seems to support fewer test scenarios compared to mockito and it s also less mature
myisam is almost 4 time faster than innodb which is not acceptable in the environment we are working as i mentioned earlier that every second is worth many dollers for us
it s possible for icalendar software to make this a lot shorter with rrule but these calculations are hard and not everybody implements it
in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s ioc container makes it more powerful than wicket
post request are safer than get but that does not mean are invulnerable
basically what is happening is that when i expand one of the expander items and that itemscontrol contains a larger amount of items 25 the rendering of the list appears to be truncated
while you could use either tcp or udp i think you ll find udp gives better performance
- i usually find debugging memory in hex x command is easier than binary so i will not use my solution
my hands-on experience is that i usually am better of with getter setter and constructors
in my experience hide and show is a better approach because it doesn t mess with the dom
i know sympy has its own plotting module but the one in mpmath seems easier to use so far with the exception of this one issue of course
to achieve this you can consider instead of storing the state in an array to make use of .data to store the state show or hide is much easier to maintain and understand
this is java detecting what you are doing and thinking it may be a mistake on your part - int s are less specific than double s
the issue is that if i scroll to the right and click on say column index 20 really any index that hide indices on the left it will freeze all columns below that index which causes the table to snap back to index 0 and not allowing me to scroll because more columns than show are frozen
eval is more dangerous than get post because the submitted content can run functions like include which can access any file apache has read privileges for or shell_exec which can do anything in the shell the apache user can do etc
i suspect the continued prevalence of cvs svn is much more to do with inertia than anything else
i have been working on a simple textctrl project to get more acquainted with wxpython and i have hit a small road block
udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day
a hood technique is to tag milestone releases of your projects giving then a version number and then manage dependencies with maven or a similar tool a bit more sophisticated than ant
i tried mp4 and webm and sometimes the file size after i convert to mp4 is smaller than webm but it is also sometimes larger than the original file size
labeled break like in java would be better than goto for this purpose
i had a situation where i needed to do more than just show or hide the one element
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints
when using embed in - uiview the new view will be a bit bigger than the subviews
i start the calculation in a new thread join it to the main thread with a timeout set to say 1 second but the main thread still keeps on waiting for the calculation to terminate which takes significantly longer than 1 second
what you have described in your question makes the use of this function better than mouseover and mouseout
that means you don t know how many iterations you re going to need so a while loops is more suited to this task than a for-loop
the other question is that what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates
i m not fully sure how this should work on desktops but i m pretty sure that when you resize the browser the orientation should change provided the height was bigger than the width and after resizing it s the other way round
or is it merely a hint to whatever tool converts between swift and objective-c to better deal with swift optionals
i need to send bulk mail in my php application but its outgoing limit was 500 if i purchase vps server for sending email if it grows more than 1000+ gmail hotmail will mark me as a spam so what is the solution for this issue
try reading this link also for more study over hdpi and mdpi concept
i have read that implements runnable is better than extends thread but i have no idea of how
instead i was hoping to just put the logic in a getter setter that seems more appropriate to me
this will work as long as the double is not bigger than what can fit in an int
from my point of view the datamapper model is much easier to grasp but since activerecord is the defacto standard it feels weird to change the orm just for this little problem
if you are counting up from 0 to n you can use a single for-loop from 0 to 100 would work in the example above while nesting for loops works better if you re using non numerical ids
if further stream will not be used to read values from it it s istream part won t be used ostringstream is more suitable
question is there a way to define conditional dependency in the build.gradle or another settings file so that a particular gradlew version is used for the build process that is ensured to be in compliance with the available java version either 1.6 or 1.8 either by manual definition or better by letting gradlew decide which version of itself to use
performance is similar even 1 faster than cos and sin
in our approach our test framework extends the standard test case class junit in our case but testng seems more capable that sets up and tears down the various database dependecies with each test using the following steps
if a post has a more recent reply i want to get the replies created_on value but also get the post post_id and subject
if you cannot tolerate that use getline it s harder to use so use fgets if in doubt
what i would like to know is whether there is something in php that could check test in some simple way whether a folder directory contains file older than sometime or even how many of such files are there without any kind of manual go-through
you can also do this stuff the old fashioned way using sqlcmd from command line dbas love this for some reason but for us mortals ssms is much less of a struggle
i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now
there is a problem here because i already have more than 40 get post request with different url names
you should be able to do this in flotr which has a better license than highcharts by just throwing what they showed in this blog post on its side
as the condition reads a loop can not be zipped tighter if it s either too short less than five base or its ends do not match
if all you want is to include a padding then you can achieve the same thing with the box-sizing attribute set to border-box that has far better browser support
with library purrr you can have a prettier more compact form see soto s answer for an even more compact one with dplyr
awt is really out of date people have more experience with swing no days and even javafx
note that i am assuming a user can get invited to more than one post which seems logical
i read in some tutorials that android automatically scales up the images when the screens resolution is bigger than mdpi
you can not have multiple physical branches under one repository with mercurial like svn or bazaar but the good thing about mercurial imho is the easy user interface that is really straightforward and the performance that is faster than bazaar although bazaar is getting faster and faster in their recent release
unfortunately using hex consumes way more space and takes significantly longer i m dealing with 500gb of data and around 1 2 million records so i would really like to get the straight binary method to work
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics
it might help to reduce your gif file sizes smaller oh and i believe -depth 8 can only be used for png images
if you intend to do more than show hide
if you have a really large matrix the example in your question is far from being large no worry there will be a ram hit and unlikely to be faster than a for-loop commented under your question because no copy of the matrix is made during loops
if their original password was longer than the salt + hash you may have just reduced the security of their password assuming a good password and ignoring hash collisions
trying to build a page of charts asp control objects that are smallish and then when we click on the image a styled jquery modal dialog pop-up that displays a larger version of the chart
you d be better off using mktime for this as it s dumber than strtotime
if we put our filter in between these calls either in getter or setter setter is more efficient as it is called only when filters change we modify original filtered list with our filter and return it back through the getter
as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services
its not necessary and will potentially introduce bigger issues as you migrate your code to staging and production regions
since the file which has to read in have more than one spaces as the delimiter between some of the column the above method does not work
i m struggling to know how to put it back together with the multi-index and then how to get the 2016 values that were either higher or lower than the min max already recorded
if the working set is smaller than your ram it should not be disk bound
i am trying to make my div wrap the tag however it doesn t wrap the height is always higher of my div and my tag has no padding or margin i tried many things but doesn t work i am adding my style and the html code i am also going to add some screenshots
when the draggable is dragged over the droppable you change it s snapmode option from outer to inner and then when it s dragged out and the droppable is no longer active you change it back
if you need better performances than what scapy can offer you should probably use tcpreplay
children is faster than find for example just like parent is faster than parent
when we know that min is actually less than mid we try to put max at the right place in this way
tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted
you will need more include paths in here if you are dependent on more than just qtcore and qtgui but i just put those too for simplicity
when you do get the parametres are written to url so you can access them easily on other hand it can be rewritten by user so post is more secure way
but when they get bigger than their parent client width the variable elements suddenly start fitting their children instead of their parent and i m not sure how to force them not to
the problem is when a users browser s height is smaller than the popup the overflow css property adds the ability to scroll which is what i want but it also adds its own width inside the popup causing one product to move down to next line
also if you don t want the boxes to wrap when the page is too small for them to fit on one line you will need to add white-space nowrap to the parent or make sure the width of the parent is wider than the two children
or you could employ a request signing scheme in which certain request fields are hash together with the password of the user basically sending the password without sending the password similar to digest authentication but you can use something better than md5
you do this by dismissing all variations where the width is lower than the depth so for each i w i d i and then dismissing the variation where the height is not the highest nor the lowest of the three dimensions because the other two variations can go one on top of the other and this one can t join in
i suppose i could do this cleaner with int and or double using instead of like
following advise i received multiplication is cheaper than division i revised one code line and interestingly enough 71.2 dropped to 1.7 but the if statement just below shot up to 64.8 â i just don t get it
decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5
swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui
for example a lot of people that started at a higher level have no idea why shifts are so much faster than multiplication and division or the impact of branching etc
it displays things normally on the screen of course but when you go to print preview in ie7 the only thing that show is longer description. so in other words it hide that first column and it also hide the second column
i guess that the original exercise would ask you to get two different int of probably more than 1 chars each
for example english text has a particular kind of redundancy with some characters repeated more than others words that are repeated and more common than others certain words that are more likely to follow certain other words grammar punctuation structure etc
i think it is possible to play better with the decimalformat and messageformat classes here is what i can come with it passes the test cases but i don t think it is that robust
the picture is in mdpi and hdpi and my testing device samsung galaxy s i think it s no more than hdpi
my query is given below so based on the date range first i have to sort down the records after that i have no idea how to find the difference between created_at and updated_at having status success and the time difference is less than 5 min 5 to 15 and so on
when i request the shares field i can see more than one post with shares but when i request post_id sharedposts for some of them i just get an empty data array in response
you might be able to use mapzen s system as well but i haven t tried their system with large amounts of features whereas i know mapbox does work better than leaflet and openlayers for your scenario
and i want to retrieve the course names that having the min and max credits i get confused because there are more than min values
potentially you are trying to model something in inherited that is better suited for composition or your base class should be taking in an object instead of individual related properties if the properties aren t related then perhaps your base class is doing too much single responsibility principle
i wound up going with redmine and it s way better than trac
i need a query to get results from stackexchange dataset in such a way that it returns me 100 top reputation users with not more than 3 post body of post for each user
i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill
in the same breath i would also like to be able to run a specific number of child processes at any given time say for example n children running concurrently whenever one exits the parent process starts another child if needed but has no more than n children at any given moment
twitter desktop accomodates screensizes from around 1048px wide when you are on a screens that is smaller then that you are probably on a tablet or smartphone and if you open twitter from a browser on your phone you are instantly redirected to and prompted to download the twitter app
you might be better off looking at something more usable such as flask bottle etc
as it happens my choice is textpad but just about anything which is more advanced than notepad ought to be able to do this
i was digging through the flask pluggable views documentation and while i find the methodview to be very helpful for making restful crud endpoints usually i end up wanting more than just get post put delete methods under a base route with common decorators and so forth
edit i just came across saucelabs which seems to be even better than browserstack for manual testing and they also cover many web browsers tablet mobile devices
as you are always swapping it with the larger of the two heap property means that the parent is always larger than its children
and before copying the directory it is better to zip the entire stata8 folder - that will significantly reduce copying time since there are plenty of small-sized files
and i want something simpler faster than creating pop-up dialog
probably you should start with something simpler than networking swing swt and android
plus being able to synthesise both getter and setter is a more complete solution
if the mathematical result of the addition is outside the range of float which is unlikely or if it s outside the range of unsigned short which is much more likely then the program will have undefined behavior
i know that declarative way is cleaner but sometimes imperative programming makes your business safer
oh i see you need a constructor that has more access than protected but less than public
js for tabs generally does no more than show hide maybe load content
but a get seems more logical than a post anyway
wewtaco i noticed that your png file has wider dimension than the gif file and i am guess that could be a reason the black bars are showing up
if i m reading your situation right it sounds like you d be better served by avoiding inherited on thing and instead thing about category-specific attributes as properties of the relation between things and categories
i am much more experienced with vbscript than jscript but i will give it a shot since not many takers on this question
without wanting to self-promote i ve also put together a blog post that goes into more detail on the aforementioned answer that should be of some use
for a unity3d game i m working on i have a situation where i want a read writeable property with a trivial getter but a setter which does some more work
this is better than using get comments api for every post to see if there is new comment
see the solution of how do i make apps smaller with qmake and macdeployqt on how to do this
if your report is complicated and have many subreports and subdatasets its better to go this approach since ireport will make it quicker and easier for you to design and maintain later
is there a way to register that user connection and act more as a push if new values exist in the server rather than every user pull new values every 1 sec for example
it s similar to the solution proposed by ckersch except that it has more overhead you re changing the dom every mouseover mouseout but is easier to implement and doesn t change the structure of your svg at all
swift is neither easier to read nor understand than objective-c
is it more safe than get or post
what is even better is oleksiy s solution because surprisingly .foreach method uses less memory than classic for-loop so if you re optimisation freak use .foreach but after all it doesn t matter because your arrays size is small so you won t notice any speed difference
swt is claimed to be faster than swing although in modern versions swing is also fast enough
if you use post when get is more semantically correct it is less communicative of the intent of your request since post usually means you are sending a payload
of those three ogg would usually be smaller than mp3
please don t mention memcached i am already using it but it is not suitable as direct replacement of apc because i am doing many apc_fetch calls because apc is much faster than memcached for this purpose
i know by giving spaces delimiter will not work as there will be split the wrong information and there will be some road name with more than spaces so in this info will be split up in wrong column
another way to do the same thing is to use jvisualvm which is much more user friendly but also more memory consuming than jhat
if you ve been using laravel then you already know it is better than codeigniter
access to disk is slower so when you ve written to a file it will be flushed to disk and no longer reside in ram which means that next time you need the file you might be going to get it from disk slow whereas in memory mapped files you know the file is in ram and you can have faster access to it then when it s on disk
and the reason why the subtree isn t reached is because you only call heapifyhelper for the children if one of the children is smaller than the parent but when you call heapifyhelper 1 the two children of the node 5 are 9 and 11 both larger than the root value
i know many of pypy s data structures are actually smaller than cpython s but again that has nothing to do with the jit
i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git
extends makes more sense to me here than implements maybe it s a typo in the book
if you just want change the src attribute is better you use attr
restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit
it wouldn t do a memcpy -- that s only necessary when the realloc size is larger and there s no room to expand
the problem i have is that some children have more than one parent but because in order to use the recursive parent nicely i need to group the results by id i only see distinct entries
and i need to check for every item if min is always smaller than max
of course there are a few other small details to take care of such as make sure the children width is smaller than the parent make sure the left and right margins and paddings are equal etc...
the keylistener is an older interface from the awt days its still ok to use it with swing but is more of a general listener
the thing is that gdi is still faster than direct2d if i draw to a bitmap and after it s done i bitblt the result back to the form it paints at 35ms and with the same graphics quality
firebird was forked + - 18 years ago from interbase 6 which was opensourced for a short time since then it has diverged and firebird can no longer read interbase databases nor can interbase - as far as i am aware - read firebird databases more recent than firebird 1 or maybe 1.5
if you have data is small or larger than the min and max will be quite different than what matlab thinks is good for pictures
or you might be happier with a fast-forward merge
i get the impression that most people think that hashing salt passwords is the more secure way of handling passwords but i can t figure out a way to comply with current company operations when using hash passwords
actually genson is faster and has more features than gson and has performances close to jackson but its a lot more lightweight see
it will always be a web format which basically comes down to jpg png and gif with gif being very unlikely because of its limitations gif can contain 256 colors at most and is generally larger than png
if you re after a plain parametrization using sin and cos it s way easier
but when i press page down button from keyboard it works fine but when i scroll using mouse takes bit more time to load data and scrollbar of gridview displays abnormal
tiff â any bit depth any compression lossy or lossless everything including the kitchen sink â and no better than png
wouldn t swift be slower than objective-c in this case since it is layered on top of it
i feel the need to mention that java s good garbage collection in general is better than malloc free of c
but there are other things you can do with little more than the addition and subtraction required to deal with indexing into lists etc
as for inheriting opacity - children cannot be less opaque than parent but could be more
however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise
actually adding a new resource folder does nothing more then adding it as a resource directory in build.gradle
if you look at your code you always use i + - 1 width + j + - 1 so everything will be ok for the lines where i is less than the height but everything else is going to be out of range
if you don t need a full dom available and just want to parse and scrape manipulate html elements there is cheerio which is more lightweight than jsdom and still gives you a jquery-like api
list.remove max is first run your program goes through the while loop again but min and max will keep the same values they had on the first pass through the loop and as nothing remaining in list is greater than max or less than min the variables won t be changed and so python will end up trying to run list.remove min
a post request would not provide any more safety than a get request any half-decent web debugging tool can forge post requests
at first to get post and get parameters is better to use
this does not work if any parent has more than one children
you can t get a patent any more because with this post i will claim prior art -
apart from that you might want to give xuggle a try - it works on a much lower level than vlcj but this should give you much more control over what s happening and unlike jmf it s a good actively maintained project.
id love to know how to solve this since using nginx sometimes is a better option than apache and having this issue with fuelphp framework and not being able to use this two great tools together is awful
consider using swing which has much better performance over the old heavyweight awt
as for your question a for-loop is usually better when you want a piece of code to run a certain number of times and a while loops is better when the condition for the code to keep running is more general such as having a boolean flag that is only set to true when a certain condition is met in the code block
maybe its your grasp of english which is the problem but its the lifetime of the connection time between connection opening and closing you need to worry about more than the timeout length of time with no activity after which the connection will be terminate
also pygtk is lighter than wxpython but i ended up bitting the bullet and using wxpython for the same purpose recently it is heavy but it didn t have any affect on the script performance
something where the app is about serving different pages you want low memory and good context switching things like preforking unicorn or running on the rubinius version of ruby with puma that makes concurrency easier to code because it will perform well with threading as opposed to something like mri with a global interpreter lock
one of the largest benefits of ironpython is that it has effectively no gil - meaning that if you are both writing python code and it is multi-threaded - you can often get performance that is better than cpython without having to spawn multiple process and pickle objects across the boundaries
c++ is not my first language and this is small part of code i can t figure out i ve chosen udp because it is always much simpler than tcp
i ve noticed that the common lisp approach is more conservative than the approach scheme has
to any seasoned developer of a c-like language break will both read better as well as provide a cleaner solution than goto
i believe that some parent will have more than 2 children
that being said i find gitolite much more complete than gitosis like all those recent blog posts illustrate
if you are willing to limit yourself to vista or later then direct2d would be a little simpler than direct3d
note there are some cases you will have to handle here you may have to split at punctuation characters and hyphens and you may have to cope with a single words that is longer than the formatting width
the while loops seems tighter than a for-loop from previous answer but look up for vs while logic
i m learning swift and much less familiar with objective-c but for the life of me i can t figure out how they are trying to achieve the goal stated as build list of encodings sorted and including only those with human readable names.
much as i used to love jmock i have to agree with the comments that mockito is far friendlier to use
without draggable seems more like it but then i can t use the droppable
textedit is not the best tool to search and replace styled text for example the free textwrangler has more powerful skills to do that
imho the main reason that they didn t catch on is that they require tended to require too much skill and used awt swing which produces worse uis than what a designer with little programming skills could achieve with flash
max_size must be big enough because a for-loop is slower than lapply you want to do as little loops through the for as possible but not too big or the list extension overhead will make the program slower
i strongly suggest either of the first two options over the latter option as the latter option does not always play nicely with the way rpm and yum handle transactions when more than one rpm are involved
i m more familiar with unicorn but based on the documentation i ve read you shouldn t have to start passenger in a separate process
my guess is that server-side implementation may turn out to be more flexible and more powerful than client-side as i can add functionality to the server easily as long as the client understands it
i know how to sort a text file alphabetically but i m trying to do more than sorting grouping
for similar functionality that speaks pandas but has more flexible features you could use the facetgrid object from seaborn
the while executes much much faster than the fadeout fadein calls so you only see the last result
performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself
it will probably take either about 1 second on a particular implementation floats may be somewhat faster as fast or somewhat slower than double or forever depending whether or not float can exactly represent all int values from 0 to 1e8 inclusive
but depending on the answers to those questions i m guessing that coalesce might do the trick for you better than isnull
why get method is faster than post
because most of the case zero-altitude distance is quite larger than altitude itself so normally you can ignore altitude
yes if one sql statement is execute repeatedly using prepare statements is much better
there s a post on the subject on the birt world blog here specifically relating to xls emitters although the tribix emitters mentioned should also enable output to rtf a microsoft format readable by word that is much more concise than doc
swift also prevents us i believe from overriding a parent class s property but also still lets us observe changes to that property--this is much better than objective-c s approach
typically you would not allow a http client to determine the uri of a new resource so a post to blog would be safer than a put to blog article-uri although http does cater for appropriate responses should the server be unable to honour the intended uri
your while loops always runs a fixed number of times so from a stylistic point of view you would be better off with a for-loop
in fact v1 uuid is more fit than v4 if you use the uuid just as a table id - because it uses mac-address and time stamp to prevent clashes
opera probably is more complete to manage canvas than google-chrome but the problem is always to exclude the finger touch if i m using the pen
as svick said it s no better way than profiling your program identifying hot spots and optimizing them using concrete benchmarking
rtsp is more of a handshake done with the server while rtp is the actual stream coming in once the handshake is done and you start streaming
another popular language that offers more power than haskell is agda - i don t know agda beyond knowing it is dependently typed on hackage and well respected by people i respect but those are good enough reasons to me
you can send a lot more data with a post than a get
because of this i m not sure if traditional crossover algorithms will work well for instance i tried ordered crossover and the children it created were generally worse than its parent
obviously as a result i need two folder in the directory folder one called bad which contains all the folder containing one folder and one called good which contains all the folder containing more than one folder
i can t seem to figure out why removeclass doesn t work when my scrolltop is less than or not equal to my nav s offset .top value
since an id is unique and the methods getelementsbytagename or getelementsbytagname returns a live htmlcollection it s better if you use these elements as unique variables so you won t ask your browser to fetch them many times
i would find this very useful if not more useful than box-sizing border-box
right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work
this code does more than just show or hide fabs on scroll it actually handles a pretty perfect action bar disappears on scrolling effect
this is not to say this is more official than jerkson just that there are many useful jackson extension modules that many developers are not familiar with
this should allow you to solve for your concern about aspect ratios i ve tried using vmin but that does not help as the height of the window is almost always smaller than the width
i want to use a jpanel and then put jlabel if using jtable is easier then i will use that please tell me which will display the data
if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks
racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development
ram is a lot faster than disk so reads and writes are temporarily stored until the data is requested by the code or the disk is able to receive it
obviously i could script each input into a get request address and replace the img src with that but post is more desirable and it seems there should be a more elegant way to make use of the form s submit mechanism
you might look at postgresql as i find it a bit easier to manage and maintain as i feel some aspects are more logical than mysql
if the app is running on a tablet or in a landscape view where the screens is larger than certain width i d like the listviews to have the data-inset property set to true and be rendered with rounded corners and borders
i have a folder named documents within that i have 3 000 text files and two sub directory which contains more thousands of text files
if you have both post and get params with same name and if you using then it will take post variable only.because post has the higher priority than get
when the draggable item is larger than the droppable div for some reason it will always place the appointment in the droppable div box that is directly below the one i am targetting
when not sorting before grouping it is much faster but then i get values from random parts of hour
it s not any more secure than get but the general rule is that you want get for getting information and post for changing information
i want to check if my pubdate i receive from a rss feed is older that now
i reimplemented the mouse move press and release events for the inner widget in order to be able to move it inside its bigger parent with drag drop
what you really need is an efficient way to insert into a priority queue when you know that the element being inserted is smaller bigger than the min max depending on whether this is a min-heap or a max-heap
maybe i would mostly always choose post over get it s more tidy and refreshing and going back issues with post method are a thing from the past in any major browser they just ask you if you want to resend the data don t they
thinking you can format magento blocks any better in a cms such as expressionengine and use magento just for the backend will put you on a hiding to nothing to end up with a fairly useless setup that isn t going to go anywhere
when you say something like heapsort should be faster than quicksort what makes you say that
i m more familiar with easymock than mockito so i had to do a little digging
copied from comment below i m looking for a statement like in mysql and postgresql count is faster for short queries exists is faster for long queries and use queryset 0 when it s likely that you re going to need the first element and you want to check that it exists
this is actually the syntax of ocamlyacc which you should not use if you start a new project in that case you should use menhir which has a more readable syntax and is better for numerous other reasons
but i ve had difficulty implementing this it seems as though nsprogress is meant more for long operations that execute all their code on one background thread but have separate sections that make it easy to determine when progress has been made if this is the case then the use of the term suboperation is a bit misleading as it brings to mind the use of nested nsoperation
change your paths to relative paths which mean they just have the bit of the path from the current directory in this case the projecta source1 bit if you ve set your current directory to your dropbox folder or just source1 if you ve set your current directory to the projecta folder which is a better idea
if you judge that the code is more readable with getter setter after fields rather than after constructor you re free to do it
yes generally post is a better way of submitting data than get
if it s too slow i would ditch the autocompletion part of python-mode because it uses rope which is slower than jedi
if a and b are opposite sign they cannot overflow - the one greater than zero would need to be greater than max or the one less than zero would need to be less than min
the new project has two job numbers so instead of using the job number text box at the top i need to add option button or checkbox whichever is easier to choose between the two different job numbers for the four groups of information
coalesce is more correct of course you could just embed isnull over and over and over... but put that under a performance microscope and coalesce may just win
using a profiling is often more appropriate than benchmarking but it seems to be even more tricky
when opacity on a parent container the #contentborder div in this case is set to less than 1 any children inherit that and cannot be higher than the parent
post request is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs
the button itself has an elevation greater than the imageview and textview so even though they are defined after the button they will still be below it in elevation and be invisible
if the loop is very tight time-budget-wise there will simply not be any room for the browser to do other tasks such as gc - for google-chrome this task seem to be secondary versus firefox which gives this higher priority likely to get more performance out of its engine
this way of doing movement is much faster than using sin and cos
the alternate screens switching is much older and as you indicated there was not much to be done i did not investigate further
you could similarly make children the transient field if explicitly recording the parent relationship is more helpful
proper handling of the last case is more complicated under cloudant and probably couchdb 2.0 due to its totally broken quorum handling but that s a different topic.
keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but it will perform slower than using union all which will not remove duplicates
but if today post is less than 10 post i will get back the yesterday post to query
finally we concluded after we put print statement inside for-loop that it will take much more time than loops in the first case without print statement
you d gain compatibility and durability because rss is more defined things will change less but if the feed doesn t include what you need it won t help you
for example given gif may be deprecated in a system because png has proven better for the system s users - perhaps because it supports better colour depth preserving the colours more accurately or svg might be deprecated because some clients have been found to be using web browsers that won t display them jpeg might be deprecated because it s known the images in the system aren t natural photographic images and the format gives visually poor results despite larger compressed files slower processing speed and higher memory usage - lots of possible motivations for making things deprecated
and the second problem is that i want to use hover or hoverintent method better than mouseenter and mouseleave but im not sure how to use fadeto to get the same effect
another gotcha is that you must make sure that an instance cannot be a child of more than one parent or else destroying a parent could also destroy children belonging to another parent
swing is far better then awt and should be educated to people who is writing gui-based java for the first time
once you re out of ram and the system starts swapping - disk access is thousands times slower than ram so any potential benefits of 64-bit code are flying out of window
ironpython is faster than c# in certain areas but not faster than cpython however you can link ironpython to any language thus over coming problems but then again you can do the same with cpython
since every browser has a limitation on the number of cookies they will store for most recent ie versions it is 50 for google-chrome and firefox it is a larger number but still finite the cookies build up until the limit is reached at which time the browser starts discarding the oldest cookies which means the session cookie for asp.net ends up being discarded causing the asp.net session expiration error
pushing and popping any item on a heap simply updates the elements in it in such a way that there is no node where its children are larger than the parent for max heap
get all the parent that have more than two children
i figured out this was happening because i was storing the wall coordinates in double and although double are certainly more accurate than int they still aren t exact
i m pretty sure the linker will coalesce equivalent strings so the total will be less than the sum of the parts for these sections but i guess typically not by much
will hide the exception-handling and since dealing with exception-handling is heavier compared to a simple if t why isn t the normal new t not considered less good practice considering we will have to use try-catch to check if a simple allocation succeeded and if we don t just watch the program die
we know tcp is better suited for this but the hardware development decided it s got to be udp
however properties become very useful when the setter getter actually does something more than just assign return an attribute s value
if i run ls folder | head in a directory with a lot of files the execution time is about 50 times faster than ls folder | tail
if i ticked more than one checkbox only one row is deleted each time i clicked delete button
when you call input.nextline as part of your exception-handling catching is it better to place it into every catch block or just inside a finally block at the end of the try-catch
suppose you were to choose a new tablet and you wanted it to have 1 a big screens and 2 a screens that is bigger than 20cm
i am aware that a post is better for this kind of thing but my question is is this expected from a get request
i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loops if a for-loop is more appropriate
in ie opera and firefox it looks much better because aa is used which is still clearly visible but not that bad
it s useful to know that extends bound is much more common than super
a profiler gives you more detailed information which can help to diagnose and fix perf problems
however it also breaks pickle maybe not dill and is less dynamic then this approach
i think that as a commenter suggested reflection is the way to go - you can get more than the public ie protected variables but still apparently can t get private ones
for example let s say width of one image you want is 200px then also you d like to have some space as margin between images too so let s say if browser width is more than 700px then we ll have images on the same row else we ll have them one below the other
i usually use the fall-through switch idiom so that if a user is more than one versioning behind you publish a versioning 3 and a user is still on versioning 1 they will go through all the necessary upgrade sequentially
also if all your classes extends class super it s better to write instead of raw class
so why while loops is faster than for-loop and why need bunch of lists
also i think typedef is a better choice when you want to define a struct
note that at least in my opinion sscanf and scanf are actually more powerful than cin and cout in a lot of ways-for this kind of parsing specifically and without bringing in external libraries they re almost always my first choice
managing changes that need to be made across these branches is a lot easier with svn than it was with cvs but it s by no means pain-free
now when clicking a time less than 1 millisecond will be displayed however it obviously takes nearly a second on my computer until the changed color actually is displayed where btw. google-chrome seems to be faster than firefox
also if i change all to png is not bigger and alos i am using prawn pdf outputting these images so cant use gif
or depending on the use case and generally less clear especially if you have more than one exception-handling expected - you don t want to have try-catch imbrications...
this type of flexibility is what draws me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster
but keep in mind that the gif color palette is way smaller than png
i d say the intersect method see answer by dasblinkenlight + any must work better than contains + any
i use tokudb on tables of up to 18 billion rows and nothing else comes close it s at least 100 times faster than innodb for random inserts on big tables
also i have tried the accelerometer sensor and it worked but i m asking to check whether the gyroscope is more accurate to this function or the accelerometer
using union all is quicker than using union since a distinct check does not need to be done
i ve been using bower info package and npm view package to see which package manager has more versions of numerous packages and have found that bower goes much farther back to older versions of the packages
i m not an expert in the inner workings of mysql but it intuitively feels that retrieving and sorting int fields is faster than chars fields i just get a feeling that a z is more work that 0 1 and seems to feel much more familiar from a computing perspective in which 0s and 1s are the standard on off flags
swing is relatively similar to awt apart from the fact that swing has more capabilities awt is probably the simplest form to start out with and has most if not all of the tools to complete your project hope this helps
the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list
edit true the file on disk is not larger than ram but the in-memory representation can easily become much larger than available ram
i need to change my dropdown menu which works well with a mouse but i would like to make it more accessible with keyboard
sorry that this post is more of the and for further information... type than a direct answer which i think has now been given-- i just thought it was helpful not to get things lost inside comments
try this lib that s a good one with the jackson we use only in the server side because jackson is more slow in the android than gson at least in our test
however when i switch from multiplication to addition it looks much better
there are more than 1000 folder inside this directory which are mainly celebrity name like angelina joulie etc and inside that folder several images are there for that celebrity
it looks like all the children have an id greater than the parent
in that case the update is done directly on the child table parent has more children .
vertical position altitude needs one more satellite in view at least 4 so is not always reliable if gps sees only 3 satelites
what i need to do it iterate over a list find the first int which is greater than 3 and is even then just double it and return it
i think reductio will make this easier but with raw crossfilter this would look something like
so it should have always been gkagent under objective-c in order to be strictly correct however objective-c is less type-safe than swift so you could get away with it with the possibility that you d get an unrecognized selector exception if a gkagent object was ever passed to the delegate method and you assumed it was a gkagent2d
i want a task or cron job that will scan these folder let s say every 1 00am and delete all folder that is more than 15days old or 15days prior to the date when the folder is created in the directory
the last fallback is to go the snail way - to mouse over to click on the red close window button but any mouse movements are slower than a keyboard shortcut
edit for those of you coming later i also learned that like sml in f# the order is specified and deterministic--unlike ocaml which is even more crazy considering how close the two are in syntax
using settimeout for such purposes is better idea than setinterval as you don t have to clear them and they won t get crowded - if your fight takes longer than period then this won t run into next fight
it is generally much more expensive than min and max because it needs to maintain internal lists of all values
while i am more familiar with mysql than with postgresql i believe it is true for both databases that sub-queries have a negative impact on performance relative to joins
it seems to work by seeing if the width is bigger then the height landscape so it also works on desktop really well
because post method storing capacity of response is better than get response
i understand that mp3 is much smaller but it has worst audio quality when is compared to wav files
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages
i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac
let s again use parent and children but like in real life children do have more than 1 parent
rsa is also a better choice than dsa because it has much better breadth of support for signatures still considered secure by nist
you can often get better results by searching vb6 which is almost the exact same thing as vba
however it isn t clear how much the value can be for the standard tumblr api you can t get more than 50 post at a time
the problem with your logic is that it doesn t incorporate the maximum distance the child is allowed to move in the top direction it will jump in 50 pixel steps and in case the newly calculated child height is smaller than the parent it just stops where it would also need to limit the margin to the maximum similar to what you are already doing for the bottom direction
in min heap a single insertion is o logn in the worst case as that cost is only incurred if the heap property that the parent value should be smaller than the children is violated
if it is true then timsort will always take less comparison than quicksort because on real life data there is some pattern except data is truly random
unfortunately looks like it requires uninstaller and reinstall as the locations seems to have changed drastically from some subsubsub folder off of appdata to something higher up under user directory
the motivation is that font size 12 under kde seems to be much larger than under gnome
if they are internal then it s debatable whether it violates ocp or not but the violation of srp is even worse anyway
only one disk read - since the disk is much slower then ram -
another downside of this angle is that querying the updated time of the parent will still give me too many children and is less efficient
also i think you d be better off with setinterval in this situation instead of using an infinite settimeout loop
i have look at similar topics but i just get more confused with how strncpy or printf are not good or you have to have a 0 added at the end or some other detail that makes picking what to do more difficult
but as you can see the first versioning is way better not to mention that all php versioning below 5.6 are already outdated - so i d strongly encourage you to upgrade instead
the short version is that having concrete base classes makes it easier to accidentally slice off your child object use arrays incorrectly
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure
there are two reasons that i can think of as to why a ram disk is slower
time spent learning a profiling is probably better spent than time writing and debugging micro-benchmarks
you can customize kate and i think you will like it better than gedit
post is not better than get
you need to preserve the grades as you go or keep a running min and max which uses less memory but requires more custom code you can get wrong
and then all your users are relying on your left right controls no matter whether they re using a mouse or the keyboard which gives you more control over how it looks at each stage
i need to pull in an array of any type and make it into a heap where the parent is always greater than or equal to both of its children
and if your csv files are stored in more than one directory you will want to pass the folder name as a parameter too
i think that in that case the put verb is more appropriate because post really means i want to create something new
each parent can already have more than 1 children
it would be great if someone can point me to a document for some javascript guide for better performance use hide show is faster than insert delete a dom
can be fast or it can be awfully slow even if division is done entirely in hardware if it is done using a div instruction this instruction is about 3 to 4 times slower than a multiplication on modern cpus
but lastly unless i m missing something this would be easier with a map or an object used as a dictionary of ids
the whole thing just no longer working after i switching my iphone to airplane mode
a repeater might be a better decision than a gridview as they are friendlier for using custom layouts
of course two parent can generate more than two children
you could try using c-types with ff which is a regular dll being called by javascript in your add-on this is way better approach that using xpcom because if the interfaces you use in there can change in each ff version indeed you will have to do multiple dlls each for your add-on supported ff versions
i assume the same control in vb.net would be datagridview and i m fairly sure that you can probably make it look better than in vb6 but if you want really good looking ones you might want to look at thirdparty grid controls
many other antivirus software that works just as well if not better than norton like avg avast and others do allow you to uninstall from the add remove
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users
assuming that the binary tree follows that all left children are smaller than their parent and all right children are larger than their parent you could use this property of the tree to reduce the amount you need to search through
...but i am not sure which method is better such as gdi or directx nor how i would implement said methods
i know mergesort is better since it is stable and doesn t have n 2 as worst case but i required to implement quicksort
i think it is a few cycles slower than addition but yes division is very slow compared to the others
on most machines int is faster than short chars so there s not much to think about there
if you are doing physical simulations things like division or square roots are going to be way more expensive than addition
each button raises the correct event but the events never reach the gridview because they are handled at a lower level by the repeater
finally you might want to look into uicollectionview which provides a lot more visual flexibility than uitableview and can be seen as a sort of generalization of the latter
it would still work if p3 was joined to p only but the extra condition prunes out rows we re not interested in there s no point looking for the min price on rows for which the price is greater than the max
it should be mentioned that sinon provides many more features for smart stubs spies than jasmine so both can be used together
a parent part can have multiple children and a child part can belong to more than 1 parent
for example javafx the reason why it is much faster than awt swing ever were is because it contains uses a huge amount of native code
what i can t seem to wrap my head around is how to determine the minimum value for the second argument to range that can guarantee the last value in the range is greater than max_val
i know you re thinking why did i use awt instead of swing but at the moment i am more comfortable with awt
an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger and may require special care on the application s part to make good use of it though it may rely on resizing by the system to fill the screens
also see i ve replaced mouseout with mouseleave which should work better than mouseout text will not jump up and down
this is little strange to me why if-statement is in this aspect treated worse than for-loop
perhaps the class should be decomposed in other classes or subclassing if in your case inherited is more valuable than composition so every class has a well defined responsibility in the system
i had previously used aptana 3 for a couple days and may have come to the conclusion that it is better than dreamweaver at actual html css coding
i ve found that rendering client-side is nice for small controlled internal uses but for anything where you want tight control over the output server-side is more reliable
another option is to spend a bit of cash on a 15000 rpm disk or a ssd solid state disk although that ll be slower than a ram disk
but there seems to be a problem while this works for most images some especially those who have a much greater width than height aren t displayed
i guess i m just surprised that the documentation recommends the approach of querying presumably continually in my case versus keeping a tailable cursor open i would have thought that push would be cheaper than pull
all children will have higher z than parent
engineyard also seems like a great company but i think they hold your hand a little less than heroku
in 1 directory it removes folder older than 30 days and the other removes files older than 30 days
data in ram can take a lot more space than on disk
i ve found stripes to be really effective and surprisingly lightweight....it aims to be more lightweight than struts
note i recommend using opera - it is much faster than google-chrome as it doesn t have memory leaks and comes with a built-in ad blocker
i am using installshield 2011 and what i want to do is on an upgrade to install all the files that are equal or greater than then versioning that is already installed
for example do you use keyboard more than mouse
or maybe flip them on my machine sin seems faster than cos
i added the check for uitapgesturerecognizer in case your class handles more than 1 uigesturerecognizer s and you only want to remove that
however if you must use the same route you could separate them by get and post since post is more common with registration type scenarios anyway
if min is larger than zero then it belongs to complete category max is naturally larger than zero then
this is kind-of the functionality you for instance see but you instantly already see that there it s called at an instance and the fact it requires to extends rather then implements pdostatement has more to do with the c-level implementation functionality of that class
after reading a question related with the performance of sin cos why is std sin and std cos slower than sin and cos
i don t need more than 2 localization now english and portuguese but i might need more later so it should be easy to add a translation if my app gets used by an russian site it should be able to send welcome emails in russian and with the name of the site brand that uses my app so i supposse what i want to do is something like a whitelabel product
a public field is not worse than a getter setter pair that does nothing except returning the field and assigning to it
i ve done a small experiment as will be shown below and it looks like that a while loops is faster than a for-loop in perl
actually if you would like to retrieve specific task with all its details get request would be more suitable than post
an alternative to using your own mock class they start to build after a while would be to use a mocking framework such as nsubstitute or moq it s more of a learning curve but quicker in the long run
you don t even need multiplication for it though addition is more than sufficient the classic example being 0.1 + 0.2 which also results in 0.30000000000000004
a becomes 10 while it is still inside of the for-loop and gets larger than 10 when the while loops goes for a second run
on every cycle of your for-loop when you need to delete an item inside your arrays just create a new char arrays which is smaller and copy the contents of the old one to the new except for the value you deleted
ogg vorbis is better quality per meg than mp3 plus no licensing legal issues
this would explain why in your case mousedown or click are slower than mouseenter which in a touch device happens as soon as you touch the element being monitored
you would like reading this post too as whenever you start comparing you might understand better difference between hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap
post requests are no safer than restful requests which are no safer than get requests
if you need to run all 3 in 1 click then you are better off with maven ant or something similar that has a good integration with eclipse
but if we need a mechanism to animate even if the change is greater than the width height of the map how can we do that
i ve got arr in front of a client s ssrs setup right now no difficulties reported and it s 100 modern iis rather than legacy nlb which is less flexible when it comes to web-centric activities
as compilation is mostly reading small files i wonder if buying a fast usb key to work on can speed up compilation time compared to a standard sata drive and with a lower price than an ssd drive 16gb keys are 30
in my experience avassetexportsession is slightly more performant than using avassetreader and avassetwriter for a straight forward format a - format b type conversion however that said it s probably not by enough to be too concerned about
this is tied to the framework although i don t know any language where a property has more than one getter or setter
i m sure there s a work around to use get for emails but the alternative post is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to get around
if your client connections are more or less permanent and not too many clients are connected at the same time tcp is only slightly worse than udp
post method are generally consume more secure than get because when we use get method than it can display the data in url bar.if the data is more sensitive data like password then it can be inggeris
by the properties of the binary search tree you already know that all children have to be larger than the parent 15 therefore using one of them instead of the 25 is valid
if you want to compare you re better off putting your result through getstring and compare the much less secure hash even less secure than md5 already is
i d recommend agda as the better vehicle for getting to grips with the ideas behind dependently typed programming but idris is the more practical option
if you have children that have a smaller height than their parent floats will bring them to the top whereas inline-block will screw up sometimes
keep in mind though that jackson is a larger library than gson so depending on your case you might prefer gson to avoid 65k methods limitation
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery
if you actually need dao s this is something that comes out-of-the-box in appfuse and put partly in spring roo but there is also a great addon for spring roo hades addon that does a great job at this maybe even better than appfuse
but even with the minimum required range it s more than big enough for your loop
it would be slightly more sensible to bind the click to an element closer to the form and if you use getelementbyid rather than getelementsbytagname it s more simple since you don t have to worry about the index of the number you re binding to
datatables has better customizations as far as clientside bells and whistles where as jqgrid is a little harder to make look as pretty but can do some pretty good serverside interaction from what i understand
note that doing this will get the values via post var instead get wich makes more sense since you are sending via post your form
and between we are just looking to send and receive data over tunnel there is nothing more or need to control computer on the network all we need is to route data through corporate firewall and should support multiple vpn servers such as cisco microsoft etc
usually in ajax get method is faster as it doesn t involve proccessing post fields and as you are only getting information i would stick it
if you decide to use a language that s larger and messier than scheme try common lisp
note when the data is much bigger than ram performance degenerates into counting the disk hits .
i wanted to know that what makes spi faster than i2c
that means private is better than protected protected is better than public etc ..
that is if you have then you are guaranteed that a happens before b and that b happens before c regardless of the fact that a is involved in an addition which is lower precedence than a multiplication
i have to use a while loops for this project i know a for-loop is probably easier but just the way this has to be done
the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for
for example if min is greater than max i want to disable the button in my view
umd is even better supported since it is compatible with commonjs and amd so that would be a safer bet
from reading other so questions such as this or this gives the impression that memcpy should work faster than memmove and intuitively this should be so
might be better off with i2c or spi like people have suggested here
i mean i want the children to display very close to each other vertically less space between children as compared to two consecutive parent on closing the the tree parent
we inline the call instead inlining is way better than tail calling and opens the door to many more optimizations
if memory serves this is the same technique slide rules used although they also took advantage of with the idea being that addition is easier than multiplication but my exposure to slide rules is limited to an eccentric high school physics teacher and a cryptographic teacher using it to explain certain tricks with big number math
it seems like you re a little confused about what a subclassing and by extension inherited symbolizes instead of thinking that a subclassing belongs to its parent class pretend that a subclassing is a more specific version of its parent class
rather than editing batch files which you may have to do for other rubygems bundler it s probably better to do this once and do it properly
using the hash value with a salt is much safer if someone breaks into your db no password is there
scala does not provide an alternative and any alternative that was provided would likely be less reliable as typesafe does not have the resources that sun oracle ibm etc
my problem with this is that the calculation works fine in the portrait mode but as soon as i switch to landscape mode the distance between bottom and button is bigger than in portrait mode
i am not concerned about the fact that firefox runs faster as browser js implementations will vary so much as the wide spread of results encountered in google-chrome that makes getting an accurate result impossible
though i was thinking the addition is more simple than multiplication
as a note and for a shorter code using the css display none and jquery show milliseconds and hide milliseconds is quicker you can even animate it by using time like this
get is more appropriate than post for queries because of its safe semantics
one reason to use rar it is sooooo much better than zip
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed
generaly get is shorter than post
at the bottom there s a partial code of a form i m trying to build it has only the upper gridview and details view for now but you can see my problem in the screenshot i took the erased row has personal data the gridview and the detailsview drops lower then the second centered subtitle
when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection
now you are iterating exactly like your example with one change to know what is the next set you are moving to you have to replace every number in the current set with the next number in the array and replace the max option that less than the minimum you are saving
it s true that the yosemite compatibility exists but i ve found that earlier mac machines does not have the propper hardware and you experience some lacks in memory and graphics when upgrading more than one osx
the good news is that dexterity content types are more lightweight than archetypes content types and doing raw listing by iterating over folder.contentitems in your template should not be that expensive
i know that obviously a tablet has a higher screens resolution than a phone because it has more pixels dots on the screens from what ive been reading tablet also have a higher dpi dots per inch than phones as well
my code below however sometimes gives out a value more that my max and less than my min
in this case a parent row can be linked to more than one children without duplicating data
bottle is rather faster than flask
if you want to support better than just addition and subtraction you could do it as an eval if you are careful about how data gets into #number
you may want to look at turbogears which is built on top of pylons and has more out of the box things for you to use
because you can determine what code in a compiled-language is likely to do better than a dynamic-languages it has been determined more error free to use a compiled perspective for more things so as you can see with the availability of offset-management and lookup compiled behavior given to you in core perl there is no reason to mess with the symbol table if you don t have to
edit okay so the real problem comes when you try and make your container that fluid because height is harder for a browser to calculate than width
yes some functionality possible only on device but you can try also bluestacks app player which has more possibilities than android-emulator
note i am looking for a more elegant way than strsplit or substr
if what you are making is a map from one word to another you might be better off with a dictionary
even though i liked many design aspects of swt and it is simpler than swing imo swing is the one to learn because imo it has far far better documentation examples etc
if you use map_shared | map_noreserve you can use a memory map much larger than available ram + swap -- but if you run out of disk space or quota your process will receive and die from a sigbus signal.
so i ve started learning swift because it looks way better than objective-c
i understand that ram is typically thousands of times faster than disk but i o speed is not the only code running
post data isn t inherently more secure than get data
following my comment on your original post here s some more information that will help you get through this
it would really depend on the processor and the range of the int which is better and using double would resolve most of the range issues
even in your original post the subclassing is actually more restrictive than the superclass so doing something like
they are for example too big in a phone and too small in a tableth because the screens of tablet has more centimeter than the pone screens
i m thinking that this is just happening at a larger scale with your percentile since you re basically condensing their rank into a 1 to 100 scale
i am trying to make all a row of 4 images all have the same height size i already tried to play around with the width and height using css but nothing seems to work the portrait images always end up taller than the landscape ones here s the code
for your first problem make sure that both the classes are in the same package and the members are declared either public not recommended or protected better or don t specify any access specifier which is a bit more restrictive than protected
i have a simple parent has_many children relationship and i m trying to get all parent that have less than n children
post is more secure then get and data transfer size limits are also there
granted iisexpress is much better than cassini but if there is no reason to not use full iis then i conitnue to advocate it s use
d3.js is much harder to learn than raphael but in both cases you will also have to learn svg to be able to create better animations
i have a collapsible panel that was designed in a way that the children green are wider than their parent red
but the problem i am facing if text is doted inside the label it calculates nsstring size less than uilabel size in the below code
the jquery way in which the clicking of the check button compares the two values and alerts if the max is less than the min
you would allow post get post is more secure to the php file and would then run an http post get request from c#
a directory or folder is nothing more than a location on a disk used for storing information about files
i picked the 4-coordinate form as the canonical definition here but if storing the width and height makes more sense for your model feel free to swap the default and classmethod factories
as you can see the program is much quicker under pypy than cpython which is why i moved to it in the first place but at the cost of a 10-fold increase in memory
if you don t already know vb6 there s little point in learning it now - your time could be put to much better use by learning vb.net c#
division takes a lot longer than multiplication - just do it with pen and paper to see
if you are happy with this sequence of permutation there is little more to do
i m new to nginx and want to try it out since it apparently is much faster and less resource-hungry than apache but i can t see why this would be such a hard thing to achieve
wav files are about 3 times larger than mp3 files so it would need 1.8gb additional space to do the conversion
so is it enough only to use limit to get more than 50 post
i ve seen mention that it is two orders of magnitude slower than host malloc and free
so now i just want to forget this virtual directory system and make the solution explorer to be nothing more than a folder tree as it is in real just like a windows explorer
early this month i started learning swift as i found it fun and easier than objective-c
if you want only very coarse parallelism at best and you intend to stick with mostly functional structures then pick based on something else like syntax i think haskell is much nicer here but that s subjective or available libraries haskell wins on quantity availability but ocaml might edge it out in the graphics department nonetheless
a get post is easier in that regard
the only thing i can suggest is that you use ppm format which is even easier than bmp for you to read from
first off get is no less secure than post
it should be in my opinion more strongly noted that password hashing with salt is no longer secure and should not be used as others noted use pbkdf2 or bcrypt
i think it can be better to do form submission through javascript so on submit function can be controlled more wisely to kill popup on more than one submit click....am i right if yes plz guide this way
does anyone know of a jquery plugin that would stack elements like masonry or isotope and displays bigger smaller elements based on importance
nevertheless i would recommend sticking to the queryover versioning it s much more intuitive and you avoid magic strings especially that you don t have to upgrade the nh versioning
now the children have a lower z-index than the parent
i ve seen plenty of questions asking whether quicksort or mergesort is better and when to use each of them but what i d like to see is some input on when to use them with regard to the size of the data being sorted
i ll add that if this is the first time you use bsearch and qsort it s better you look at the samples you can find around
since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks
postgresql specifically has gotten easier to manage while mysql has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter
any suggestions on how to manage the android actionbar in phonegap - i ve seen some other similar questions but generally asking how to show it seems like getting it to hide is less popular
next i can use 3rd 4th and 5th level of arrays means more than for-loop statement will be assign
a uicollectionview works very similar to a uitableview but gives you more control over how the cells should be displayed and aligned
what i d like to do is make the button images slightly larger than the checkbox and have the text checkbox and both button on the same line
for this reason i deployed a 2 cores 4gb ram and more than enough disk to run through the getting started example of the enterprise integrator
ultimately the check point is do not use more than one for-loop and never use the while loops
also when you open a matlabpool the workers are launched and ready so the overhead of parfor is much less but still not zero as the body of the loop needs to be sent to the workers
maven is definitely better than ant and well used for big projects
but the research i ve done so far all points to multiplication being faster than division
you cannot directly use an expandablelistview for the spinner popup any more than you can directly use a listview for the spinner popup
i think d3.js looks so much better than leaflet but for quick zooming panning functionality my first question is is this better off in leaflet or can d3.js handle slick zoom pan even though it s not tile-based
edit the proposal by jens from the comments using the min max is probably more what you re looking for if you re not interested in complete ordering of your values
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation
it is even slower since i could only upload wav which is way bigger in size compared with ogg and opus
in the compareto method you can then write the code which will call the getters for the year month and so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than equals to or greater than the object o being passed into the compareto method
in your viewdidload on the second view or viewwillappear is probably better set the background image to the image you put in the property
however it is better to do this on the php side and work more securely with post instead of get
so after googling this i found that using gyroscope sensor is more accurate than the accelerometer
multiplication takes less time then division so you can try this
for security http vs https is more important than post vs get
i d like to know what is the difference between heroku and openshift for now i m going to use the free package for my blog i ve noticed the openshift has more supported techs
well we typically don t do too well reading binary and hex is a better substitute for that
so in my practice using war app easier than jar to manage and re-configure
this one is more promising than revmob because banner positioning and event callbacks appear to be possible but due to marmalade and cocos2d-x s gl conflicts this might turn out to be just as bad a solution as iwgameads
i m more familiar with mate than cairngorm but what i do in this situation is to back up my pop up with a model and dispatch the events off of the model
modulo is a bit weird for floating point - it returns negative for negative so you still have to have a branch and it involves a division which is slower on some machines as in i ve not found a machine where is significantly less expensive than going round a loop with a couple of subtractions two or three times
just press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background png file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a gif file and is as good as a jpg
i want to have another textview underneath these two but i am having a problem when the textview length is less than the imageview
a disk seek takes about 10 000 000 nanoseconds of course some disk are faster but the best of them are still thousands of times slower than ram
i wrote a plug-in a short while ago that will handle text input much better than keypress keyup and keydown events
you can parse it like what you are using or you can do the same with more less code and more performance by using gson as described in this answer or you can use jackson as described here
although this is much faster than explode without the limit it is not as fast as the substr solution suggested by the user set sail media
the above assumes you are in the same folder as your docker-compose.yml and the directory is all lower case characters
in your example i would suggest to use rbac rather than acl because rbac is more flexible for enhancements and maintenance which will be always in system like university management system
instead of dropbox i could use key value store as rest web service which i want to do later but have no time for this for now in my opinion my solution is more reliable than icloud and which is very important i have full control on how itâ s working mainly because itâ s my own code
now if you free some values on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier
however post data are not much safer than get data anyway
edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use
alter how i am joining the tables together so that the sorting of the results for the grouping by is more efficient and then hopefully remove the tmp table as well
there are simple examples 1 2 for intercepting get requests in the documentation for http-on-modify-request however intercepting post requests is more complicated
since clicking the mouse is significantly more difficult for me than typing i was wanting to make a simple program that would just run in the background and click the mouse for me any time i press a specific key on the keyboard
otherwise there is still the possibility to change a public access to a protected or package private access which will be much more restrictive than public
there is no way that you can detect if the user entered more than a chars by scanning a character.you ll have to use an int .since all your case s consist of numbers you re in luck
you might want to ensure that max is greater than min
dialog makes it easier for you to create a pop-up window with customized contents
furthermore protected is actually closer to public than to private
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression
i ve been teaching myself a bit about declarative vs imperative programming and i ve come to the possibly false understanding that declarative programming is more or less just abstraction
so the easiest way is to use one either webkit or gecko webkit has probably better support for svg these days plus i can t find package of gecko right now
it is worth mentioning that there is a commercial product named jrebel that is much more powerful than jvm hotswap
getting proficient with a mix of sr and keyboard mouse is much easier than full hands-free operation
simply i just kept only the latest .android folder in this directory c users user name removed the duplicated one and then emulator started working for me
this is better than strtotime and strftime because it does not try to guess what is the format of the date but rather use the date format you provide
sublimetext 3 needs much more time several seconds more then scite before the opened file shows up and i suppose it is because sublimetext does some pre-evaluation of the file content like detecting areas suitable for folding there are fold triangles available depending on indentation of non-white characters in the file
i am using jquery ui dialog to show more than one pop-up on one page each pop-up will have its own id and it will be triggered by an anchor with a attribute
so for example a galaxy note 1 calling a gs3 experiences more delay than a galaxy note 1 calling nexus 7 tablet asus and galaxy note 1 calling a xiaomi mi-2 phone
suffix expand if the parent view is larger than the combined size of all its children additional space is available then the space is proportioned amongst child views with that suffix
you will notice that swift bundles are always about 4-5 mb larger than their objective-c counterparts and this is precisely why
another important difference is that valgrind can report a lot more information than gprof does but that s not specifically related to using it
any pointers would be appreciated i d love to get this working as you can imagine doing the post synchronously is considerably slower than asynchronously
can anyone help me to hide it onload and show when is more than delta and hide on scroll up when is before delta
while it is simpler with mouse keyboard is kind of tricky
edit more recent scipy does a better job of not always padding to powers of 2 length so is closer in output to the pyfftw case
objective-c is much more free and easy with types and compilation checks where swift isn t
alternatively you could check to see what the user enters will fit in the box before accepting his her input - but that ll have to be implemented ie a width of 5 will allow the text to fit in the box provided height is less than 10 - a condition that can easily be checked for
i searched a lot about a tutorial or even a documentation describing how to add custom settings fields to general settings page in vbulletin admin panel but no way unlike the wordpress which is much easier to get tutorials to
since the fixed position in general is not all that stable on touch some more than others google-chrome works great it is still acting up in safari ios 8 in situations that used to work in ios 7 therefore i generally just use js to detect touch devices including windows mobile
again if the parent view is not larger than its children the expansion suffix does not make any difference as well
insertng in search binary tree you need to keep track that children are stored in the specific order child smaller than parent on the left and greater or equal on the right and parent has at most 2 children
the problem is that the post shipping takes longer than the call get alert then shows me the session variable not updated
we have a few clients who have very high traffic sites running apache slower than nginx with varnish in front of it and they get way more traffic than you are saying with little to no performance problems
usually i subclassing the stock cocoa classes customize to my needs and if i need custom methods in more than one subclassing i will declare a category on the superclass rather than relying on inherited to provide my custom behavior
overriding choice for me is macports as it has many more packages than homebrew and it puts its stuff in opt local to stay out of the way of other programs
but i don t want to use d3.js because some other feature in c3.js is better
i know tcp is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use udp and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do
webm is usually more robust than mp4 which can be all over the place
i guess you are able to see the complete layout in portrait just because portrait layout is having more space and your complete layout is fitting well but landscape is having lesser space
the first solution i thought about was using the keydown and mousedown that seems more work
to navigate to f you must go to c users folder a b c d e f within each directory there are a number of .html files and potentially more than one folder also
2 yii a bit more structured than codeigniter but you have a basic app up within 10 mins and if your familiar with mvc design its a great way to develop portals incredibly quickly
so what i want to do is when the user select options in the two selectbox verify if the min price value is lower than the max price value and if not show a message
so i decide instead of writing out chucks of code for each of the 10 possible health point not to mention there are other player stats that will be done in the same format i decided upon scraping together a for-loop with two if-else statements to attempt a loops to fill each grid element as long as the health value is greater than the for-loop s i
i solved this myself the problem was just qt errors no problem with the code at all for some reason it didnt like that my project files were in a folder structure of more than one folder before my project files used the exact same code in a new dir and it worked
it has functionality the same as a canvas but swing is more advanced and has better features than awt
if uiscreen mainscreen knows that i really want the height to be greater than the width whether or not i actually do how can i either query the actual dimensions or query whether the device is in portrait mode or landscape
if you continue to use your method of performing this task then you need to manually check if the addition of the two lower order decimal digits has caused a carry by checking if the result of the addition is greater than 10 and if it is subtract 10 from the number and then add 1 to the higher order digit calculation
however take some time to consider how you re currently using uialertview and whether you are able to give ios 8 users a better experience by supporting uialertcontroller
one way would be to fill the diagonal elements with something lesser than global minimum and then use argsort -
i won t go into the discussion whether wicket or jsf is better this is mostly a religious battle anyway but due to the popularity of jsf there are simply more people experienced with it and there is a large community offering many things for jsf like component libraries and extensions
when dynamic div are placed if the content is larger than #bat width and height those content are overflowing.i can hide that using overflow hidden in #bat but i don t want it to be that way
i only mention this because a lot of people are more familiar with mysql than postgresql so linking lastval to something familiar might clarify things
it seems to me that swift would be way simpler to learn then objective-c for beginners i know because i learned it in like 2 months and swift is less complicated and better laid out then objective-c
children smaller than parent
assuming that the parent has a smaller id than any of its children and that the default value of the parent column is null could you order them this way
using the post method isn t necessarily more secure than get
if you are more comfortable with updatepanel these should still work if you have everything inside a form tag and a scriptmanager within the form tag too
even if you can handle them with npm it s better to use bower since it s optimized for this purpose no deep dependencies among other things
i think that s why i can t use to launch my project this way works but jar way is better because everything including the main_class is described in manifest.mf
here s what it looks like if the parent is bigger than the children
i am trying to bind it with a gridview or a datalist whatever is more appropriate without success
then the right events to do it is keyup more than keydown since the value isn t yet in the field at this moment or on change
but right now the sorting step is taking way longer than the filtering step so i would like to combine them in some way
a while loops or do...while loops is more appropriate here than a for-loop because you do not know how many times the user wants to execute loops
but that seems a lot uglier than implements a facade pattern and just extends the map code but that is a lot of intermediate code to create a facade for
i guess you can just manually check the condition within your for-loop continue if it s not met but a while loops makes more sense imo
make sure that you re running a versioning later than 1.0 you may want to upgrade if your versioning is older than that
analytics -- when you can scan via the clustered pk you get better performance with innodb than with myisam which has to bounce back and forth between the separate index and the data
i know that it would be easier with the parent knowing it s children using a list but that s not what i m after
if you use another library like glut or sdl it becomes much easier let the library worry about setting up a window and then you can focus on learning opengl
it will only really matter if you have lots of hash-collision since then the get key call gets slower than o 1 - it gets o k with k being the number of entries in the same bucket the number of key with same hash code or a different hash code which gets still mapped to the same bucket - this depends on the capacity size and load factor of the map as well
on many systems int is smaller than double so if that s the case on yours this is very likely to be the cause of your crash
gets have a size restrictions post do not or at least it s a configurable setting on the server and has a larger higher end than a get request would
on windows xp however it works fine on local file systems but when watching folder on a mapped network drive it throws an ioexception when trying to watch more than 50 directory
i m in the hate it part so anything i said is biased plus in our test prototypes developing in wicket was faster than jsf
disk files are of course an order of magnitude slower than ram and thrashing your virtual memory system could actually be worse than that depending on your access patterns
multiplication is higher precedence than addition and addition is left-associative so this is equivalent to but knowing that only tells you that the first addition will happen before the second addition and that the multiplication will happen before the second addition
from this question i found out that iis server is better than cassini for my purpose but i don t know how to check the default server of my website
we can send fewer data with get method compared to post method
obviously reading a block from cache is much more efficient than reading it off the disk since ram is much faster than disk
the post get may fix the problem - get is much more lax with security than post
unfortunately including .class only goes two directory deep and does not copy any files that are deeper than two directory inside of the bin folder
the first time i run this on a device i realized that i was on a wrong track for some of the local phablets tablet mobile that have large screens has less screens density
this isn t to say that xhtml2pdf is bad just that it s going to take time for it to be as good as rendering in a browser and if pdf output for its own sake is what you really are interested in i think using reportlab directly is a better choice
research showed me that mantis is simpler to use over bugzilla so i decided to use mantis but have no idea how to install it.can anyone please tell me what are the steps you need to take in order to install mantis bug tracking system in a small company to track website mobile portal bugs
normally you can just call parent class methods directly by doing parent.foo self ... but in case of multiple inheritance super is much more useful
i am more familiar with vtk than itk so propably what comes into my mind is a bit biased
i have some buttons i want to order in a table layout and everything is working fine but of course a tablet screens is much bigger than a normal smartphone screens
edit you probably only want to validate when the value changes and field loses focus that s why imo the onchange event would be more appropriate than onblur not onblure
these methods which give us access to private members are known as getter setter or better knows as accessor mutators
excel cannot process data more than 64bit big it will store it in powers of 10 but in our application i want 128bit data for that i have formatted particular cell to be text format in excel sheet so that i can enter very big number
you might want to try running your trainer under pypy if you aren t already -- it s significantly faster than cpython for some workloads
param should be params and therefore your data is not being serialized which would explain why the server is rejecting your post since post requires more privileges than get presumably
well if it is a single calculation you wil hardly notice any difference but if you talk about millions of transaction then definitely division is costlier than multiplication
looking for a swfupload url their site is down so maybe plupload is a better bet
i m building an application in both bottle and flask to see which i am more comfortable with as django is too much batteries included
the diminishing returns means that if you need more swap space than twice your ram size you d better add more ram as hard disk drive hdd access is about 10â³ slower then ram access so something that would take 1 second suddenly takes more then 15 minutes
if the data is critical you should go for tcp which is slower as compared to udp which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not
i m running unicorn which is about 40 faster than thin on celadon cedar
the point of such an architecture is because i have news with some text between which i want to be able to switching with paging effect but the news text can be bigger than the screens
colt does this already but i have found it is more complicated and more powerful than jama which may explain why simple functions are slower with colt
it is well-known that the processor instruction for multiplication takes several times more time than addition division is even worse upd which is not true any more see below
i just wanted to point out my answer since i know for-loop is faster then loops
if mp3 ogg is better try different compression ratios and sample rates to see which goes faster
in my case i found jackson little faster than gson i used default serialization because so far i don t have a need to customize serialization
small in firefox is smaller then small in safari so never ever use them
i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better
note that this will work when the variable is public but it is best to limit the scope as much as you can so protected is more sutable here
but i can t get this to work when the max is actually lower than the min
frankly i care less and less each day as i become more and more impressed with clang llvm
i feel swift is better than objective-c in many aspects but my major question is - will swift dynamic libraries support older version of swift
as part of the method i wanted to enforce that a point should be greater than zero but less than the width and height of the board in other words it should actually be on the board
if lob-storage isn t in ram at the time of a query execution then we need to read it from a disk which is of course much slower than from ram
as mentioned in comments use the post method instead of get because post allows much more data characters across in one message
as suggested in the comments since you are saving data post is more appropriate than get
this works as i already said on some devices gt-i9000 and amazon kindle hd but on a nexus 4 the images that have a much bigger height than width tend to occupy the whole damn screen
i ve thought in using a pairing function but that makes children exponentially bigger than parent so after a few splits there is an integer overflow
now i want from all user that have more than 1 post to get all post except the most recent post
i m trying use a grid layout but my problem is the layout showing bigger than my screens on the 240dpi tablet 1 5 times bigger
from what i can gather arc4random generates much better random numbers than rand does however i haven t seen a way to seed it and i would like to just like using srand
with this set each time you boot and the sata negotiated link speed of the ssd is less than 3 it s going to reboot until it s 3 however many times it takes
i would advise you to try wicket it is very easy to learn much easier than jsf and it let s you re-use many existing components as well
even if addition is faster than multiplication i think that you will lose more because of the branching
from a software engineering point of view as soon as you make a function protected you expose it to other users of course much more limited than public exposure but still much more exposed than private and you create expectation about some stability of the api
i would also recommend you to check hikaricp as its way much better than c3p0
post has a lot more advantages than get
i m not sure if this matters but the gif is significantly larger than the png files
what i want to do is if a user checks the more than 1 checkbox all radio button must turn into checkbox and users must be able to check more options
if you think about a moment this is exactly what you want - to know if width is smaller than height portrait the opposite landscape or if they are the same square
hons generally runs slower than cons because in creating a hons an attempt is made to see whether a hons already exists with the same car and cdr
while the post method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the get
final result will be of type ienumerable and in terms of performance this would be better than iqueryable since here join is taking place between in memory collections
since i am using two for loops it is consuming more time and is affecting the execution time of my entire program which already had a for-loop
i keep hearing from some people that graphicsmagick a fork from quite a few years back that branched off from imagemagick is significantly faster than imagemagick
so i think a custom checkbox is the better choice here but if you really want to use a button i would use a hidden checkbox field and apply onclick functions to the button to change the value of a hidden checkbox field
having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management
far better to use a surrogate key and yes a join on an int is often faster and you can join in delete staments in many databases not use the slower subquery especially since names tend to be longer than a few chars
better than get use post method to send and retrieve user data
it might be helpful to see why quicksort is usually faster than mergesort since if you understand the reasons you can pretty quickly find some cases where mergesort is a clear winner
sortedlist is faster when you want to enumerate the elements and you can access the elements by index and sorteddictionary is faster if there are a lot of elements and you want to insert a new element in the middle of the collection
i finally ran it through pypy and was delighted to discover that when the lists got really deep pypy was running significantly faster than cpython
if you have not programmed assembly before i suggest you choose mips since it is easier than x86 and then b looking at how to transfer data with the serial port to begin with since this illustrates memory-mapped i o that is used
question iâ m seeing some compromise in mp3 quality my converted mp3 is lower file size when compared to wav but my audio quality is little poor than wav wonder if i can increase the quality of the mp3 file
post is a little more complex than get though
moreover i cannot use more than 2 spaces as a delimiter when using sed since sometimes there would be only one spaces between the item name and the second column like in the last line in the example between c and 5
this is relatively slow since reading from the hard disk is slower than reading from ram
nuxeo is definitely more advanced in this because with its web interface you can customise almost everything but alfresco has other advantages
i also find sorting and filtering is also easier on windows forms
ansible is in an earlier stage than chef puppet and other tools out there when it comes to community support
however using get rather than post is typically more appropriate for things like this where you are only selecting different options rather than changing data on your server
i think adhering to the dip principles makes it easier to comply with the ocp principles
4 i d like to understand why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server
for example when the screens size becomes smaller to a tablet or mobile you could do this as an example
firefox renders the video correctly and it matches the background and in safari it s always brighter whether you add the filter or not
i mean i think realloc is way smarter so why do we even need malloc
in the cleanup even in normal case scenario i would regard the use of goto as being clearer than the do while 0 constructs among other things because the target labels themselves practically cry out look at me far moreso than the break and do while 0 constructs
if you could upgrade to that versioning there is less that has to be done
usual way with tagging is to get objects by tag but if tags are used by few applications it may give more than post
an interesting answer about this can be found at why is quicksort better than mergesort
for api 18 and earlier the margin is being applied after the alignment so if the margin in the imageview is greater than 0 you will get your textview moved
i ve come across this website and when you scale the page down to tablet size the logo which is ethan marcotte is in perfect ratio when the screens size gets bigger and smaller
we don t need the getter or setter it s more for convenience
a side note since you want all rows using union all is faster since it does not need to perform a distinct to eliminate duplicates
i suggest if possible that you not code in awt but rather code with swing which is much more robust and flexible
says that enhanced for loops is 3x faster than the regular for-loop well that great and its easier to write anyways but what if i need the index
you just need to connect using the entity framework driver and if you develop in any of technologies that uses dbcontext includes code first model first and data base first but is lighter than objectcontext you can use the list below
it s just as fast as going the opposite direction if not faster given that division generally takes longer than multiplication
we could still do this with settimeout but setinterval is better suited for this job
redmine is definitely much more popular but trac is getting more popular in particular as 1.0 version is around the corner
now this test tests more things than one post put delete which breaks the idea of a single unit of work..
you could do it with a while loops as well but a for-loop is nicer
also swt is actually newer and more actively maintained than swing
they have their differences better stick to one i prefer for this example to use keydown just plays better with me you can use keyup
with the exception there is more data with the post than the get
if you overload it you must also define it as protected or define it as public which is weaker
class cplayer has a lot more fields than i put here but they are not relevant to this post
this can be done in a repeater but a datalist control is more straightforward and is just as easy to use
why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters
decimal types libraries are fantastic for financial applications because we re used to dealing with the style of rounding required in financial stuff but there is the cost that they tend to be slower than ieee floating point
step #3 if you see that the last versioning is older than your current versioning do whatever upgrade logic you want
at this point i m putting off worrying about client-side validation since server-side is more important
if you want to stick to lower level basic file operations ant is better bet than maven
in my opinion swing is easier to start because there are tools like the eclipse windowbuilder which enables you to create your application in a graphical interface but javafx is more likely to be used in the future because it has some great improvements over swing like css skins etc.
as in c# development in my past i never create a new instance of some tcp socket in loops if i want to make it asynchronously - i create a single instance with delegates to async functions and if there is a similar situation in c# project like in javascript code here in the question s content because it s doesn t produce new objects in for-loop it takes less memory and as for architecture it s represented as more clean and good solution
my guess is that they are technically happening simultaneously but that the margin animation takes longer to complete than the width animation
on the other hand you may very well have legitimate reasons to have a bunch of properties that are no more than getter and setter
checkbox may be a better fit than button here
i am running into an issue where for some of the folder there are too many subfolders and it spits out the directory name k really long path blah is too long not the actual dir- the actual dir is longer than 260 chars
the results end up very close but the emgucv image comes out a little bit blurrier than the opencv image
also note that the fact that the avx are a newer than sse doesn t make the avx faster whatever you are planning to use the number of cycles taken by an function is probably more important than the avx vs sse argument for example see this answer
can anyone more experienced with ionic angular give me a hint what is wrong here
i am scraping a list of rss feed by using curl - look at the xml from the rss feed that s giving the problem there s more than one feed so it s possible for some feed to be right and for the feed that are wrong to be wrong in different ways
according to this test - hide is slightly faster then fadeout since it doesn t use animations
just making boilerplate getter and setter is better but is almost as bad as public properties
most of the patterns i ve seen will either break when inheritance level is more than 2 levels child parent grandparent or use more resources by implements super through closures
or in case there are less than 5 post you will get an error
especially look at the last two results for longer strings for which the preorder inorder approach is much faster than brute force
additionally you should reset i each time you go through loops and a for-loop makes more sense than a while loops especially if you re using c99 as i can be declared within loops
using a ram disk is even better though often more of a challenge to get it to implement for you
here it is with reshape in base though joran is right melt is likely easier
i think it is because the disk is slower than ram
simpletest is slightly easier to grasp but phpunit is the best in my opinion at least so if you want to start learning and using a framework start with the one you re going to use when you ll be a master in tdd
i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3
so if u change the field min as 0.8 the error shows up as min should be less than max till that moment the field will be shown as red border since it is wrong
if you re building a simple demo of a rendering mechanism glut is way better than sdl it takes care of a lot of the details that sdl would otherwise require
p the second thing is porter stemming algorithm but then i realized lemmatization is much better for my cause.
your nummines calculation will always return 0 because when you cast a double that is less than 1 to an int it will be set to 0 which means that the statement in your while loop will only be run a single time hence only a single mine being placed
after thinking about playing with it some more and reading some other posts using objective-c typedef in swift here is a better solution i think
it can be with post or get get is simpler
it sounds to me like you are asking for the union of the filtered session values from the two tables and as you want the distinct set you do want union rather than union all union all is actually a much more common requirement than union
qnx is most famous for being the real time operating system of which there are two versions qnx rtos v4 is an older product but is still used in many existing systems and still supported by the company
1 yes there is a obvious benefit reading from ram is faster than reading from disk
sendmessage type functions will be slightly slower since they have more coding inside them allowing them to work with more than just mouse and keyboard functionality
but apparently tracing garbage collection is so good that it is better than using malloc free
it s much better compressing than zip rar
if you don t mind the libc allocation functions realloc is even more efficient it wont copy the data on a shrink just mark the extra memory as free and if you grow the memory and there is memory free after it will mark the needed memory as used and not copy either
now my doubt is when i rotate it to portrait mode from landscape mode since the width of the textblocks present inside the itemtemplate of listbox is already defined when i rotate the it to portrait i am not able to see all the data present it cuts off since the width of the portrait mode is less when compared to landscape mode
i ve created an application with this library instead of jgraph because i thought that jung is easier to learn than jgraph for newbies even if it provide less features
however if you have special needs regarding properties such as specific get accessor implementation needs then better define a function which gets the value as you need it
me too don t get any advantages for joomla it s big system and it just as good as wordpress for regular projects just wordpress is much simplier
i want to add a uiview of smaller frame as subviews to parental view but i am not getting the needed
index for children will always be greater than the parent as shown in the vector above
if your growth factors is larger than the golden mean that can t happen
the problem is that all inline child elements get a huge margin above them even if their font-size is much smaller
we even setup replicas outside aws using stunnel and put ssd drives as the primary block device and we get ridiculous read speeds for our reporting systems - literally 100 times faster than we get from rds
but you will have loops the outer arrays in order to get it to work which would be better done with a for-loop so you reference both at once
obviously for something like show hide functionality a checkbox makes more sense than a button
this is where i learned that localization is a lot more than translation
is there a better function than show hide which looks as nice as the accordion does
its really strange that the same doesn t work with a while loops as is said that a while loops is more fundamental that a for-loop
last to address other answers while you should use post data when modifying something it is in no way more secure than get
at very high speeds amazon s3 does have some recommended request rate and performance considerations but this is only when making more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second for a particular bucket
this seems a good use of geom_pointrange but it will make no sense for your example because your avg is higher than your max and on 6 7 your min is higher than your max
the fresco docs explain how to use drawees and you can see right from their xml definition that they are much more customizable than imageview
as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content
remember disk is 1000s of times slower than ram
i ve been told that coalesce is less costly than isnull but research doesn t indicate that
opengl is better for playing around and experimenting because you can easily draw triangle without messing with hardware buffers available on larger selection of platforms plus glsl is better than hlsl because it doesn t compile into assembly
post has more capacity it can transfer more data than get
google-chrome always reports 250 for both widths as expected but firefox always reports a larger number though the exact number may depend on the os and or version of firefox and or phase of the moon
for removal and transliteration there is a better tool called tr translation or delete characters
the user will check a few more than 1 checkbox and hit the start button which will send out emails with information on checkbox selected in the dynamic table
it s much more than post get etc
since most data-storage mechanisms in-ram in a database etc. get a lot slower as you put more data in them you should ensure you re only timing your http access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage
when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above
some possible options that might be nicer than multiple dialog pop-up
but in my opinion for most sites expressionengine is a better choice than wordpress
it looks like at least on safari and firefox prototype runs significantly faster edit not 20x as stated earlier
if my guess is incorrect please edit your question and add the missing information column separators number of columns... note that the tsv and csv format is trickier than it seems
so the values can be mapped with each list now by the property of checkbox you can select more than one checkbox unlike radio button so when such case comes the dropdownlistfor that is being populated on the basis of each checkbox selection now comes in a merged format like on selecting option 1 and option 2 both the list contains all the elements mapped to both further on de-selecting it comes back to unmerged state
when people talk about pypy using less memory than cpython this is a major part of what they re talking about
our team use django as our frame before but now we use flask as our frame because it is more light than django but we still use django template.
if you pick up something like mips and get the hang of it x86 is less of a monster to learn
if i have to use the value of counter in my program then i think while loops is better than for-loop
mockito has been around a lot longer than scalamock and is much more actively maintained because of it s much larger contributor base
if you take that segment of html code and run it in a browser i tested it with latest google-chrome and firefox it adds one more th element in the table the final page has 4 columns instead of 3 and i have absolutely no clue why this happens
specialname is more than properties accessor event add remove methods count here as well that s why you have to check the names as well
in short it s worse design to move things to the base class than it is to downcast to the specific class
i simply want to get the genre id3-tag of an mp3 file but the id3v2 utility returns more information than i require and i don t understand what this data represents
if it can be practically determinized this give you a dfa that can be exponentially larger than the nfa then by all means do that
i am more familiar with express than koa but could also see it going in the entry server.js file
i ve used both uploadify and plupload both are nice plupload has more bells and whistles though and has things like html 5 drag drop from desktop supported
in my opinion it will probably be easier to integrate with codeigniter although someone more experienced with cakephp might prove me wrong
but avro offers far more than just doing away with the need for your own writables although that is in my view a considerable plus it offers fairly efficient serialization the choice between serializing against generated entity classes like thrift requires or using a so-called genericrecord structure instead and not having to have tagged data
quote from the third link - the altitude error is much greater because it is a satellite based system
if i do not touch the screen letting the screen dim off and then turn the screen on the pop-up dialog is no more there
the reason to use post for sending sensitive data is that it prevents data leakage via the query string although another way would be to use get with custom headers set although post makes much more sense
this also allows you to add more elements between min and max and not be concerned with the ordering
to be perfectly honest i junit is way more popular than testng at least here where i work and live
just because you have data that is larger than your ram amount doesn t mean the node should go down it just means that not all documents will be available in ram and the node will sometimes have to fetch from disk slower
for large and complicated systems yes there are enough bugs quirks that can rear their ugly heads - i am convinced that the reason that people tend to always go with mysql over postgresql is that the name mysql is much more attractive
this particular jboss runs in a vm with 4gb of ram and 2 cpu s and more than enough disk space it has never has less than 5gb free at any time
turns out this was a hardware failure the aes commands need more power than the des crypto1 ones 50 more which the antenna failed to deliver at the reading range i was testing with
you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the fread function which is much faster than read.table
first of all i recommend you to use ogg instead of mp3 has better performance
it s a little less magic than metaclass but it also means you re going to have to remember to decorate each subclassing
there are other rolling window functions in various packages if you need something more general than min and max in the future
doing it with mouse is much more slower than it can be done with keyboard
be aware that guaranteeing immutability by having no public or protected constructors is easier to break than making the class final
gtk and qt are two of the most common ones these days but there are others such as motif which is older and doesn t look as nice
when you put more than one qwidget on a qt form you should always use some kind of qlayout the quickest way to fix your problem is to select all items in your form and click on the grid layout button the one with 3 x 3 small squares on top of the designer box
i think having each permutation in their own container that you hide show is the better solution
ultimately i want to filter all parent objects that have less than 2 children
those attributes let you create objective-c code which is more understandable by swift and complier warn you when you break the rule for example
if you just expect puppet to restart httpd simple because you asked it to then you either need to use a program like ansible which is more of an actual task manager or use some kind of inotify thing to see that a certain file has been changed so httpd must be restarted
it api seems for me easier than swt you haven t got to manage disposing components by hand to prevent memory leaks you adding component to panel instead of constructing components with parent panel information former is closer to my previous experience...etc. native look and feel you can get in swing too overall performance is enough good swt should be faster because it s using native components of backed os - but is the performance gain really big pro
please keep in mind that qmake and qbs are two very different build systems with fundamentally different designs and capabilities and qbs verbosity is in part due to its fundamental architectural differences which make it far more powerful than qmake will ever be capable of
i don t want to use boost because that s a library i haven t used extensively yet and i m doing this partly as an exercise to gain greater mastery over the stl
as for not reinventing the wheel like many have said already make sure to first explore the possibilities in the standard template library stl which is much richer than you might think and then look at boost www.boost.org which has libraries for a lot of diverse purposes and they are extremely high quality and some are just works of art like spirit proto lambda and mpl
i am trying to use an svg form an image on a website as it s far more crisper than an png gif or jpg that i can use
however in my experience while this routine will return accurate origin and height information the width is typically longer than it should be
try-catch rsources is fine for some cases but this is the old way and works better when you have more than 1 exception-handling in a block
i read somewhere that nemerle s macro service is more powerful than boo s
passing an int is easy to imagine passing a double is just bigger and passing a struct or class could be very big indeed
how can i make the two droppable div s to not accept more than one draggable elements
a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory
obviously this may cause problems such as missing functionality that was released in later versioning of devtools but if you can t upgrade it s better than not having it
i have made some testing and it came out that rsa is lot slower than dsa
i get far more than 50 post
although putting data with post method little harder than simple get
if it s only one colour you want selecting you can use a radio button instead which would be a better idea than a checkbox
at times the get rate is slower than the put rate and we see messages backing up
this approach seems more complicated and possibly less clear than inheriting protected and then using into public the base class members your child class actually needs to expose
traditionally there was a huge difference in speed imperative has fewer overheads because it s more directly like the computer works but some more modern compilers of declarative code seem to be in the top few of the speed tables a lot of the time - compiled verses interpreted makes a much bigger difference than imperative vs declarative which is why python etc are often slower even though they re imperative
note that i much much much prefer the ansi standard coalesce but sql server has done us the favor of documenting why isnull is better effort that imho could have been spent fixing the problem
then again it s better than settimeout setinterval which fires only once per second if the tab is not active in google chrome a common use case for audio file listening
however your current code does the opposite continuing to run when the productindex is less than the max or greater than the min
another analogy could be using map dictionary to model anything objects data event handlers etc but using a more specialized form of map dictionary makes things more explicit
what i want to do is to check how many seconds the time is after loops and then if the time taken to finish the for-loop is less than 60 sec than run the mysql update
it is often useful to have different accesses for the two most often a more restrictive setter than getter and so the likes of
the upcoming canopy 1.2 release in a couple of weeks will include more complete integration with ptvs and visual studio that will automate this and remove the need for canopy to be the default python environment
ok guys i cant find better solution with show hide or something so i added snippet to be more easy if someone find solution why when back to top opacity still 0 i need when back to top opacity to be 1
i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think
nsstring is more general as it leaves you the oppertunity to create another subclass of it that could add the altering functionality without using the nsmutablestring s implementation why ever you would want that to do
almost all sip voip providers allow you to forward calls from an attached did telephone number to more than one sip device so your request could be satisfied by a basic account on your friendly neighbourhood voip provider
you can hide show the status bar on android 4.1 api level 16 and higher by using hide show functionality
x-tag 2 is now using the polymer polyfills so it may not be much better than polymer but worth considering
can anyone please let me know what is difference between for-loop or foreach loops which is faster from both of them
you should also keep in mind that sortedlist performs worse than sorteddictionary during construction if the items are not inserted in already-sorted order although in this particular case it is highly likely that dates are inserted in chronological sorted order which would be perfect
without adding any extra complexity to the rockauto site it appears to structure it s tree view as make-year-model-variant but year doesn t really have any attributes or children or parent it s more like an attribute of model
to me it looks like safari gets it more right than firefox text is generally more around a middle line
though it has a couple of rules that check for specific security issues it s far less advanced than veracode coverity or fortify in this respect
however i can t tell you right now if this cost is higher than the serializable and deserialization cost
now since the pseudo-element is below all of the floated children the parent div happens or better yet seems to contain the floated children as well - which is really what you want
if the difference between max hi32 and min lo32 is less than about 6 days worth should be enough for a packet capture exercise
there are certain types of browser event that selenium struggles with that sahi handles much better
when the screens size is smaller i have it switching flex-direction to column which works well except i cannot figure out how to make the 2nd row trending down start where the trending up stops where ever that may be
you should check this thread why get method is faster than post
have a look at this post it is probably easier to get the selected radio button by changing your itemscontrol to use a listbox with the existing datatemplate
an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it
post or get is not really make difference in security if your code is vulnerable to injections post or get method would not make any difference or even you can say get is more secure because get url will be logged entirely in log files and if there was an injection in your code you can find entire injection code part in log files but post data will not be logged
it s simpler deals with salt for you in a completelly transparent way makes way for updates both in encryption algo and in hash time cost and comes bundled in a nice api
on a button click javascript validation should be if a user select one checkbox it should allow to process further to any script but when user selects more than one checkbox it should prompt that you can select only one check box
if old is greater than new free the extra old pointers on the end before doing the first realloc so you don t leak memory
i want to have the milliseconds or better captured by fluentd and then passed on to elasticsearch so that the entries are shown in the correct order
i have been trying out redmine to see if i like it better than mantis
children can belong to more than one parent
after doing more research i now feel that using a dependency manager like the documentation recommended cocoapods or carthage is a better option than manually adding the framework to the project
my issue affects all browsers ie being slightly quicker than google-chrome or firefox according to that issue ondisconnected was delayed only when navigating to another page in the project - in my case ondisconnected is not called immediately even when i close the tab or navigate to an external page
also keep in mind that once ram is exhausted your program will start running in virtual memory on disk which will probably cause far more disk i o activity than the program itself so if you re concerned about disk i o your best bet is probably to make sure that the batch of data you re working on in memory doesn t get much greater than available ram
this approach using purely images screenshots and generating mouse and keyboard events is more similar to manual testing activities performed by real people which have just monitor mouse and keyboard
you didn t provide a full code sample that includes the surrounding loop presumably there is a surrounding loop so it is hard to answer definitively but the main problem i see is that the latency of the dependency chains of your fma code is considerably longer than your multiplying + addition code
first the sub-directories of your src directory should mirror the sub-directories of your include directory this is just to keep things intuitive also try to keep your sub-directory structure reasonably flat shallow because deep nesting of folder is often more of a hassle than anything else
snappy also consistently decompresses 20 + faster than lzo which is a pretty big win if you want it for files you re reading a lot over hadoop
what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates
note also that gson comes with less features out of the box than genson or jackson
i ve already done the rsa but dsa is bigger deal to me
you ve struck lucky with the requirements - because you re going from udp - tcp it s actually a lot simpler than doing udp - udp
anemic domain is when a product or other class doesn t really implement anything more than data setter and getter - no domain behavior
this blog post provides more info to get started
i wrote one query but it will fails if a particular parent has more than 10 children
i thought when i pass 1 as the argument java would have picked the first argument because int is more specific than double
it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration
there can be times when mouseout is a better choice than mouseleave
often gcc g++ code is faster than anything i can produce in asm probably because i am new to assembler and so i don t know very many instructions
paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation
i do understand that traditionally they are saying that lxml are stricter than beautifulsoup however what i do not get is the following
i am looking for a good new component that offers more help with wav and mp3 files too but not found what i am looking for yet
this way it is not ok if the parent has more children let say they are input s
in my actual code i ve set the display to none if the screens width is larger than tablet size because that s the only time i feel like i need the button
it s like complaining that a sha256 hash is bigger than an md5 hash - yep it is but only one of them might slow the attacker down for a while
so if you are just starting out beautifulsoup may be easier to use instantly but in the end i believe lxml is more pleasant to work with
you may try to listen to uideviceorientationdidchangenotification within your subclass cell to rotate the webview and within your view controller with the table view and run a -reloaddata on your table view in order to properly resize the cells assuming the landscape webview is way higher than the portrait webview
what i m trying to get is a page that displays 20 users per page will have pagination with the fallowing info it should show only users that have more than 2 post published
i also dilemma to choose in between whileloop and for-loop but think that while loops is more suitable because unknow how many time need to insert the words
md5 is no longer secure and it can be broken with a good gpu no typo you can use your graphics card to break a hash
before i looked into this i suppose i knew it subconsciously but i never actually thought about it but a 5 chars is smaller than a 6 chars in the same way that 5 is less than 6 so you can compare the chars as int essentially for this intent
the problem you outlined is that the droppable is allowing more than 1 draggable item to be placed inside of it
it appears to be getting every second between the min and max seconds well 1 second more than the max date time and the getting a count of records to go with that
hash password + salt is better but still not good enough.
this is a radical concept i know but the mouse is slower than keyboard shortcuts
from what i remember there is something to do with the height-for-width drawing model that means when wrapping is enabled gtklabel etc request enough height to reflow the text for wrap-width even if there is more horizontal space available which leaves loads of empty space when the width is wider
this is my first experience setting up lighttpd as i thought it would be more suitable than apache in this case
but i don t know why the size of mp4 video with h.264 codec is bigger than the size of the image set in the only implementation i found so i made my own archive format that is basically the imageset merged together in 1 file and compressed with snappy plus the info for split them again
data should be in post or get.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use get which is less secure than post
a get request will be slightly smaller than a post although using websockets would give a more accurate figure
parsley is more robust and adds a lot more features than robotlegs which is why its been used in the world s largest flex applications
i hate to answer a request for a solution in language a by suggesting a solution in language b but what you are doing here falls into the class of problems which xslt handles much better than xquery
generally the division is more costly than addition i think but not much difference in this case
then again smarty 2 is years old v3 has been with us for years and twig is far more practical in the html5 age
you will probably use both in large projects - put the definitions of the functions that should be inline and templates in the header and put the ones that inlining makes less sense for in the cpp
however as things stand right now ironpython is much more mature and has much better performance than ironruby so you may prefer to use that
protected is closer to public than private
just keep in mind most of the time c is faster than python but then again most of the time pypy is faster than cpython
if you re just going to loops through point use a for-loop as while-loop is more prone to dropping into an endless loops if you forgot to increment counter or doing wrongly or do it in multiple places
in this case post may be better than get anyways
i have experienced situations where union s made a query much slower than union all with a distinct afterwards
this is easy to implement with buttons select items click up or down buttons to move - just loop through and apply the move to each selected item but much more difficult with drag reordering
i d question whether get is the right verb here considering you need to pass a complex type it sounds like it would be better served as a post
however a post request is less efficient as a get request - bear that in mind and only use post if you really need to
just be aware that screens size categories like xlarge for example aren t tied to a hard number like 10 inches. instead official documentation uses terms like an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger ...
public is higher than protected so there s no problem
however if the keys are not comparable how are we supposed to tell whether the children are greater or less than the parent
if you want to allow for more delimiter than just spaces tab you can add additional separators when using split
also if you are willing to change your layout a bit you could achieve this through weight and linearlayout note however that this will work only if the desired combined width of the 2 children is less than what the parent is willing to offer
4- you then need to loop over max to check if any rating is higher than any min
i m having an issue where my glsl 130 code wont run properly on my somewhat modern ati 5850 hardware while the identical code runs perfectly fine on an older laptop with a nvidia card i have
this works because a parent thread will always have an id which is less than its children
animated png is better than gif if we re focused on file size â achieving a smaller file size was one of the reasons the apng format was designed
but when the screens is smaller than 900px we switching from fixed to liquid via media query switching to a liquid width will allow our images to scale down our text to wrap and a whole bunch of other great things
can any one tell me which one is better between session facade class and singleton object design patterns in asp.net
more or less the same thing as the accepted answer can be implements more succinctly by extends the gridviewpager like this
usually multiplication has a higher precedence than addition but the grammar you have posted has the reverse that might be part of your problem
to allow you to scale down the data away from 0 and 1 i had to do this when combining colormap in matplotlib single pcolormesh with more than one colormap using matplotlib so you can likely see how the code works but basically say you have values -5 1 10 in a sample but want to normalize based on a range of -7 to 7 so anything above 7 our 10 is treated as a 7 effectively with a midpoint of 2 but shrink it to fit a 256 rgb colormap
maybe not productive in the same way - i d say vim is quicker for editing files emacs is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the vim equivalent
i know mysql has to choose for either mandatory or optional but mandatory seems the illogical choice for me as this is 1 much more difficult to implement in sql and 2 less common than a parent with optional children
changing it will require a reboot. that will slow things down a bit as the swap file on disk is much slower than ram
i create new branch add those new features and than i once again made pull request but now the features i implemented in the master branch are also in my new branch so my second pull request has more features than i want to push to the original project
not that i think this is a good idea but in c at least you can check if your unsigned integer is greater than int_max for two s complement anyway not so sure about the sign magnitude and one s complement variants but they re probably rare enough that you could safely ignore them until a problem pops up
it won t do anything to change the fact that disk io is orders of magnitude slower than ram
third you initialised end to len lis2 this will give indexerror list index out of range if you are trying to search for an element which is not present in the list and is greater than the max element in the list say 23
the nice thing about letting the plugin install it for you is that if you re more familiar with ruby-on-rails than padrino as is my case this will not only set things up for you but also show you were the directives need to go
i d strongly recommend to go with allegro 5.1.x it s a little bit more difficult than sfml but very functional and easier than sdl it s got nice support and it s compatible with plenty of os
thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it
but using post instead of get presumably adds one more level of protection for xsrf types of attack it does not you need some form of explicit xsrf protection token with post or with get
i can verify that by unchecking the checkbox it does flip the value because i enable disable the next button depending on the myproperty value - i have more than one checkbox btw
i would also be moderately surprised if the multiplication actually was faster than the addition
basically a given branch of the tree may be found under more than one parent branch but wherever it is found it has the same children
i haven t chosen a db yet so if mysql or postgresql is better in some way over the other please provide your preference and perhaps why if you have time
so congratulations - you can pat yourself on the back your avx routine is indeed about a third faster than the sse routine tested on haswell i7 here
edit added some getter and setter that makes it clearer how you access object info
i success in plotting distance with points but i need more visual plot with heatmap
as a general rule of thumb i keep the parent bigger than the children
if you don t need it to be public it s often safer not to due to getter setter allowing better control over what values can be assigned then you should declare if protected or private
functionally a multiplying will always take more time than an add because it combines a true multiplying along with a true addition step
since your disk even if it s an ssd is several orders of magnitude slower than ram the systems gets unresponsive
to the operating system a single thread which i assume is what you mean by java process essentially cannot use cpu on more than one processors which may or may not mean a physical core-- see below simultaneously
post is not any more secure than get
in general ogg achieves better compression than mp3 which is a plus for things like download size bandwidth resource usage etc
if your tree is not binary that is a node can have more than 2 children it might be worthwhile to introduce a virtual parent node that has all the real roots as its child nodes
i am not sure could this be because now the older links after upgrade is been pointed to newer versioning and just linking is not sufficient and need to modify something more on linux
put is preferred for database updates and post to create new entities so post is better on this case
i d rather not use use extjs directly - i m looking to expedite delivery and ext.net seems much easier
also using private and protected instead of public is more about good programming design than security and i recommend you read about it as well as polymorphism and inheritance
to draw you can use either plain gdk which is more basic or use cairo which is more flexible drawing library nb
dexterity arguably has more better documentation than archetypes see plone.org products dexterity as well as my book professional plone 4 development
i cant get the orientation through exif because of my server don t have root access to fix that so i was just going to see if the width is less then the height then rotate them but the code isn t working properly
you can also do the first list as but count distinct is a bit more expensive than min and max
i resorted to split the two in swagger list-without-search as get and list+search as post just to put the page in the swagger documentation also if the latter actually works also as get
regarding your question about safety -- the answer is post is absolutely no safer than get
many people don t know about 8-bit png which is usually better than gif in size.
the reason this is happening is because firefox renders the select box as a taller element than google-chrome and the container of the blue text is getting caught on the select s container element because it s now sticking out lower than the others
it ends up in a state of confusion...you basically cannot release the drag of the table it keeps getting bigger and smaller as you move your mouse - but you can never let go and release it to get the size you want
i believe this works for the general case provided min is less than max
i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg
any suggestions as to how i properly set up the setter getter is more than appreciated
but when anyone human looks at it they look at it in hex using a hex editor which is much easier than reading binary
a post has broader application and is generally used to send persistent data to a server in fact prescriptively get should not be used for this purpose
you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from its hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say
you re unlikely to find anything faster than the min and max functions
i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better
i saw this swift vs objective-c and it does lead me to believe that swift is more accurate in terms of timing that objective c but i wanted to make sure that was accurate
in future these lists may be read from disk and larger than available ram
file must be in the same or higher directory as target folder
that answer is pretty clear a chars is smaller than an int and when objective-c was designed back in the 80s shaving off a few bytes was always good
i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research
if you want to move directives attributes from parent to children this is way more complicated
note that + and - are much faster than cos sin etc
if you re simply looking to hide the value from your cross table you shouldn t need anything more than the show hide items menu
this goes in your root .htaccess but if you have access to httpd.conf that is better
that prohibits you from doing something like having a protected and public overload where the protected overload is the better match
timsort is used by python and java for their sort methods and is rather supernaturally fast but it s a more complex algorithm than mergesort which matters if you re working in something like c - so if you just need something that works pretty well and is simple go with mergesort
also it seems that my view gets called more than once according to the log outputs and that is normal except it should be a post then redirect to a get but it seems to have more than one post request
if it is unavoidable node.js has good options - try to use the module cheerio which is faster than heavy weight jsdom
it works fine and fits all my needs but recently i found that git works better than bazaar so i decided to use it but i face a problem with git usability because most git s gui not user friendly as bazaar explorer so i want your advice based on a practical experience which best git s gui user friendly or which one is most similar to bazaar explorer
i am trying to explore kde a bit but many of the tools i rely on have fonts that appear so much bigger under kde than gnome even though the chosen font size is the same and the resolution is the same 1920x1200
now don t get me wrong regenerating the session id on login or more accurately as oswap put it on privilege level change is indeed a very good defense against session fixation
i saw he used checkbox which to seems much more useful than button since you can take multiple objects out at a time
you can make your life easier by extends each of the components you use to a custom component that either implements its own event but then always the same event like contentchanged or takes a java 8 consumer function that is called whenever the content changes
also you can send a text only to given client determined by the url it can be post but put looks nicer
i think that the boost manual could have explained how the allocator is used more explicitly
if so then you can just pop lines off the array using settimeout which is better than setinterval for most animations
using post is more secure than get in the sense that data shown into the url in get request but not in post
i tried using schedule static num_threads 4 and noticed that my programme always completes in 11.5s to 11.7s always below 12s at about 320 cpu runs more consistently and uses less resources even if the best run is half a second slower than the rare outlier with hyperthreading
another suggestion change you to because you can keep an extension method for more collections because the ienumerable is more abstract than ilist
the only thing i can think of that is easier with the mouse than with the keyboard is resizing windows
you can possibly achieve slightly really marginally higher throughput with udp but then you have the hassle of recreating all the goodies tcp gives you for free
what is the best way to get the better visualization with bokeh or seaborn
it has some downsides- namely working with both ant and maven so the actual pom.xml is more difficult to comprehend but it does allow for more flexibility than is otherwise possible with maven
otherwise you will run into issues of trying to fadein and fadeout at the same time if your delay is shorter than your fadein
you will find that coalesce works better than isnull here
well i have written this class wich do this but when use cin cout works no more
not that these are bad granted they tend to be an order of magnitude slower than addition subtraction negation etc. but they aren t needed and if they re present it probably means the implementation isn t really that efficient
this method also allows you to put the url within the action parameter of the form and uses post which is more secured for transferring password information
it s likely that you will get better results by using int math.round ... math.round returns a long if you pass a double
if you want to target any case when width is greater than height i think something like min-aspect-ratio 101 100 or something like this might work
phpmyadmin also shows the larger number however i have switched to heidisql since i find it s gui is superior for my local development
if you have more than one show hide box you ll need to create more tables
addressing issue #2 if your mdpi phone has a smaller screens than 600dp it will use the layout in res layout folder
better if you have a code swift is better but is not problem objective-c
it does not have master worker as unicorn or passenger thus uses less memory
spoiler its namesake may betray why addition subtraction is more costly
as for the suggestions in the comments keeping the fork result in a variable a then waiting with waitpid is safer when you have more processes as wait waits for the first ending process not a particular one
unfortunately the sample apps are not based on uimanageddocument or nspersistentdocument but if you look at the way they handle backup files you could probably use that approach to create a document based app with less hassle than using uimanageddocument
firefox and opera unfortunately fires many more keypress events than others ie and webkit which have the most sensible implementation the one the w3c is about to standardize in dom 3 events afaict but in that case getcharcode is 0 so you can safely ignore them
without more detail it s hard to say why your approach doesn t work but my guess is that you are seeing the sprite positioning you describe as a result of the fact that if you don t change orientation the lower left in portrait is the lower right in landscape when rotated left it s the same point in gl space 0 0
since you want to track cars a simpler approach is based on the consideration that a person is smaller than a car or that with reference to their bounding boxes for a person usually the height is greater than the width usually a person is standing or walking for a car is the other way around
swt has a more platform-specific look about it but java ships with swing built-in there s no messing about with external libraries as with swt although the use of eclipse may make that much easier i still develop quite a bit of my stuff from the command line unfortunately
recently we noticed that cypher queries run faster than gremlin so we decided to convert our queries
the iodbc included with os x has some things that are listed as deprecated and i ve had better luck with unixodbc in the past
this may help those confused by dask and hdf5 but more familiar with pandas like myself
i have an asp page where the status of a list is approved by selecting checkbox and then pressing approve button however when i select more than one checkbox it throws the error index was out of range
try catch inside for-loop is probably closer as long as you don t mind the unassigned values left in the arrays
i can t use screens size because of devices like galaxy note with huge screens and some phones have higher resolution than some tablet same with dpi i think
as well i used innodb engine but myisam is better if most of the queries are select and you are not going to do many writes
i guess post would be also fine but get is always better for our use
these steps were taken from this blog post which contains more details about how to investigate and what output you ll get
i know that swift is buggy as heck i run into bugs everyday but ill bet objective-c was even worse when it started out benefits of hindsight so in a couple of years swift will be equal or greater than objective-c keeping its basic simplicity as well
how to restrict user to select not more than 10 asp.net checkbox on button click event if user select more than 10 checkbox then alert box will pop up that you can not select more than 10 checkbox
there is another principles which i like even more than srp - dry
jeff kaufman has a good demonstration of how box-sizing works and why border-box makes more sense
show hide gives the better results but the selected thumbnail remains the previous displayed panel.
right now you have more ol elements as children of parent ol elements
it simply comes down to the space available a tablet gives more room to developers thus allowing developers to put more on one screens
we can call its compareto method to decide whether it is bigger than equals to or less than any int
is there any easier way than put all in set and get set size
it s like asking whether sin is faster than sqrt
and also make sure that your current date should be greater than min date and less than max date
this article seems to suggest that this is possible by swizzling a fake location into apple s cllocationmanager class to be used by other apps but i am unfamiliar with the objective-c code more familiar with swift
i saw that the discrepancy was because in safari the text element is taller than in firefox and includes a slight amount of whitespace on top that doesn t show up in firefox in firefox the top of the text element is exactly when the text starts
edit explained as i m guessing you are somehow forced to use glut but i agree with other posters glfw is a better option if you can choose
i myself did not use brew before but this page says it is less intrusive than fink and macports so you may give it a try
or if there is too much intermediate output to be shuffled your job will become slow as you will need disk based shuffle in such a case which will be slower than ram based shuffle
ssd disk are good but they are still much slower than ram
but when more than on switching in accessory is on - if three switches are on and i turn off one switching then the did select row works
the active selector handles the mouse click much better than mouseup down you just need a way of reading that state in the onmousemove event
if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as it gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent
i suggest you try increasing your maximum to just under half your main memory and attach a profiler visualvm is better than nothing and see if where objects are being retained
i have no idea what i m doing so i dove nose-first into nginx -- which i had never used before -- because someone told me it s better than apache at dealing with lots of small tasks and requests -- not that i would know how to turn apache into a proxy mind you
the hash idea should work minor note that sha-256 wouldn t present collisions md5 is no longer secure but it depends on the trade-off if the service involves something really really critical a client-side ssl certificate would be the best way to proceed
as i am benchmarking my cluster i discover that for large file my get command is actually slower than put command
so i have a form that submit to a database and i want to prevent more than one submission if the user clicks the submit button more than once...with a little research this seems easily enough done however none of the solutions i found worked for me as i am using the jquery validationengine plugin to validate the form client side
best example the division it an an addition are both o 1 but usually the division takes far more cycles time to execute than the addition
though if you are going to eventually fill a substantial portion of the map the dictionary method is much less efficient
actually i want to move it to the top while dragging and move it back afterwards but this problem can be illustrated in a simpler way with just mouseup and mousedown
a heartbeat mechanism pull model is definitely easier to implement but a push model is far more efficient
using get is much easier than using post for most of developers
so if your code has tough data dependency problems addition is about 12 times faster than division
first you have many different library you can use instead of retrofit the basic one and i think the simplest is okhttp but you have to understand that okhttp is no more supported but still work when you downgrade your sdkversion and you can use volley to perform the same service as retrofit
in future if they add more than one directory at the root level i will handle it but for now you can assume they will only put in one top level folder
the table on disk is bigger than your ram
also post is generally considered better than get for ajax calls as it doesn t have the same string length limit slightly more secure too
however i could not find it the documentation so it may inherited more than properties
so union is much better than the union all with distinct in performance-wise
you can do the same thing with much cleaner code with chr ord and array_map
as you see i too mistrust whether the tab chars are real tabs and also use two or more spaces as delimiter
so yes at least in this respect csc is smarter than vbc
but this is no good for desktop because the height may be larger than the width probably quite rare though but the orientation will never change
i ve already built a view that can take a drawable can use focused pinch-zoom and drag can auto-scale images can switching images dynamically and takes images larger than the screens
i don t think it get s simpler smaller than http get post and json unless someone can correct me
in the past the redis developers experimented with virtual memory and other systems in order to allow larger than ram datasets but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well data served from memory disk used for storage
it selects all direct children children exactly one level deeper than the parent
in case 1 the node at which we stop is the local min because i it s smaller than both of its children and ii it s smaller than its parent which is the precondition of our deciding to check this node
a system with a lot of ram will have advantages when switching between different instances of visual studio because their state won t need to be written away to slower than ram disk be it ssd or not
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better
what i meant to ask is it can be argued that npm has a wider user base than bower some even argue that we should stop using bower altogether like here and here
i ve tested this on a few devices a nexus 10 tablet which gets the bigger version of the file from the xhdpi folder a generic tablet using mdpi a galaxy ace phone mdpi again and everything works ok
i am not sure but by reading the documentation i think you need to download the pyodbc it seems to be better supported than adodbapi
i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home
in both cases you may also have to shift one or two elements off the start end of some blocks to the end start of the previous next block again at most o n 1 2 times to maintain an invariant that no two blocks differ in size by more than 1 except for the last which is used to take up slack
translating this to gremlin is a tad bit tedious pattern matching in cypher is more natural but lmk if this is in the right direction and i ll do it
you could use nant to send email but teamcity is more appropriate as it can provide a centralized place for notifications including emails
i ve been looking at services and the two most comparable for grid testing look to be saucelabs as mentioned above and also browserstack which offers a cheaper unlimited package i believe
using post over https is better than using get and http
after pressing it about twice there is a smaller and smaller delay between the gif being set and the png being set
i interestingly think using min or max is the more pythonic approach
use of malloc free is even more rare and should be used very sparingly
some recent tests we did showed that postgresql does perform faster than mysql and we believe the table partitioning feature in postgresql will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production
with get and put it is more likely that the media-types are symmetric however that is not a hard rule
the reason why you get the exception mentioned is because when you call byte.parse but the string that you put in is greater than 255
i did not make any changes more than change protected to public but i add another class in a new package to print the rules by these following codes
performance i did some test with simple game similar to swing copters and found that game created with libgdx consumes 15-20 more ram on ios device that the same game created with cocos2d-x but then i used apportable to run cocos2d-x game on my android device and found it almost not playable
the uiview is taller than the screen so in ib i pulled it out of the scroll view so i could see it all but i never moved it back to being a subviews of the scroll view
realised that templates are incredibly powerful and don t need to be slow and use of the stl and boost is much more widespread than 10 years ago
it compares every item except the last - it will be checked by the second last item and checks whether the next item is smaller
problem a parent can have more than one children and parent table is dependent on child table
and if you find yourself with more issues after this post i check my github daily so logging an issue against my repository will get more help in a better place for a back and forth
so yes it can be used with flash or rather pure actionscript but it is a little less convenient than with mxml where everything is set up by the framework because it takes more under the hood configuration to be able to run all the necessary parts for remoting
i assume this is because comparison between int is much easier than between chars strings but i was looking for some literature to back this assessment ideally some database structure book
in landscape it has more buttons in addition to what is there in portrait mode
take note of this there is no way to subclassing more than one superclass at a time
another option would be to add a cast not recommended due to the same loss of information the error warns you about - the fractional part will simply be removed from the value and double can hold way larger and smaller values than int
in fact one could theorize your approach of having it show up after the finger is released is better than what google-chrome and safari is doing
if necessary i can switch to tga though png is more convenient
you got at least put and delete although they are used much less frequent than get and post as in hardly ever
i used apache-poi for excel sheet and i know that it has a good api support for word doc too but i heard that docx4j is better in handling word documents
you ll probably want to add an addition check that the time between the mousedown and mouseup is less than 500 milliseconds say and that the mouse hasn t moved more than a pixel or two between the events
if you will have only yours commits on your branch issue is much simpler you can do squash those git squash
grouping has looser constraints than sorting so in theory it could be marginally faster than sorting but unless you re dealing with a lot of data you re unlikely to see a speed difference
from here you also need to take into account if the user inputs a value higher than the max year of the data and also less than the minimum
it was never intended to be some safe version of strcpy - that s complete nonsense since strncpy is far more unsafe because of the null termination issue
now you could iterate through the objects to find current limits 9min and max or you could even do it while you calculate the measures each time sth smaller than min happens store new min etc
how can i make the droppable to not accept more than one draggable div
this seems to me like a bandwidth error or something like that originally i ve got the error when i played with the html 5 audio api and if i loaded the audio file 10-15 times sequentially then i ve got the error but now i ve discovered that i get the error without the audio api too just by reloading the site a lots of times also safari gives me the error much faster than google-chrome wtf
also try post ing using ajax as get is much more likely being cached
this is also one of the few places i think you d be better off with setinterval rather than settimeout
using options such as -os for the compiler to tell it to make the code small in other words don t inline-functions unless the code is shorter by inlining than by calling the function and don t unroll loops etc etc - but do inline-functions called only once as that does make the code shorter
personally i would recommend testng although if you re just starting junit is slightly less of a learning curve
nuxeo is based on open source but you have to pay the license and is pretty expensive at this point documentum is better anyway
thus i suspect when people say that nunit is much faster than mstest it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar
sometimes it is good practice to use onmousedown event instead of onclick because onmousedown is fired sooner so ga script has more time to execute event tracking it s only a few milliseconds difference but can help
mvp offers greater seperation as your presenter have no knowledge of web centric concepts
i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me
unlike radio button the user can select more than one checkbox at once or select none of them at all
spring security is fine too but if you plan to use jsf 2 you probably also use cdi provided by seam weld which is integrated into the java ee 6 profile from glassfish and jboss it is easier to use shiro as spring heavily relies on its own dependency injection methods although spring security does not need that much injected classes but you should stick to one way of doing things
puppet chef always have a place in my heart stack but ansible is just easier
on the other hand a usb connection is far more reliable better supported and of course has the inherent advantage of speed and since it is well supported does not suffer from all the pitfalls bluetooth connectivity does
i can make this work if the z-index of the droppable is less than the container but then you can t see where the draggable is since it s hidden behind the container
having used both i can tell you that it s a much more polished platform the servers are about 4ã faster you can run as many apps as you want and the heroku toolbelt is much more powerful than the openshift s client tools
this package and my answer here may not solve your problem because reading the numbers directly as chars is an easier way to achieve your goal but i thought i might post this anyway as an information for users who may need to use large int with more than 22 digits
i know for a fact hotmail is using a rules based spam filter which is quite strict and gmail uses more like a self-learning system which could explain why gmail accepts your message and hotmail doesn t
depending on your use case a dictionary might fit better than a namedtuple
the parent element has overflow scroll and when the parent become thinner than the children i don t want the children to break line but the parent to overflow them horizontally
and it seems working fine antialiasing is much better however this beats the idea of a transparent background in the process
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more
objective-c s relatively lax type checking makes this easy to deal with but swift is stricter
you do not need to set up these remotes but having them for all the repos that you frequently work with push or pull changes makes things easier for you
personally i ve used mayavi in the past and found the performance much better than matplotlib for 3d scatter plotting though the python bindings are somewhat in question moving forward i think
you should not be using the post method for requests that contain no actual data get method is better for that
so how i create my layout bigger than tablet screens using xml and just do something that will hide show the listview 1 or listview 2 to work using any tablet
the big caveat here is that apc generally has less memory available for storage though. default being 32mb memcached s big adavantage is that while still fast it s distributed so if you have multiple servers running they could share this data
personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time when it matters
you may be interested in looking at the constexpr keyword which i think is better than the inline keyword when you can make use of it
division though is an iterative process in logic the implementations you see on educational sites verilog vhdl are simply doing the same thing we did with log division in grade school but like multiplication it is much simpler than grade school you pull down bits from the numerator in the long division until the number being checked against the denominator is equal to or larger basically the number can either go in only zero times or one times into the next number under test unlike decimal where it can be between 0 to 9 times
running a quick benchmark it seems that the for-loop is 4x faster even in the worst case where you have to replace every single time and you construct a new arrays to hold the replacements
perhaps in the same vein and i had a problem of this sort with some of my other data trying to convert character names in matrix and data frames into factors results in more confusing behaviour
alone push is better in the accepted answer can t quite work as a push-operation in some class can require a new pull at the pushed object
google-chrome is smart enough to guess where things should be closed and still work correctly but firefox has more strict of standards
phalcon is more powerful verstile but to get started with it i feel you have to be a better php developer than you do to get started with something like cakephp
i have a working script to stream over tcp but i understand that udp is the better option for video streaming however i m not really sure how to do it
that would theoretically cut the time in half but it seems that robocopy is much faster than xcopy at least for this use so it took way less time
if you are still having problems jdk 8 has the ability to play mp3 files which are significantly smaller than wav you may want to try this
in this approach you won t get much from django you are better of with bottle flask
for example on the blog page of my current project i have two widgets in the sidebar one for latest tweets and one for latest music news however as you can see on this page the content of the blog post all test posts... are much longer than the height of the two widgets and would of course get larger as more post are added
in my opinion it gives a nicer solution than the mouseenter and mouseleave event
i m having a problem displaying the layout when my imageview and textview takes up more than 3 4 of the screen
the subviews version is definitely faster since having the controls loose on the uiview took more like 2 seconds to update
i have group of checkbox each of this checkbox associated to a li tag which contain a query result i have also button so i want when i check more than one checkbox and after that click on button i want to display text of li tag for each selected checkobox
i think silex produces a bit uglier code than slim but i m afraid to choose slim because it s changing constantly and i will be stuck with the current version if it breaks backward compatibility
i can only guess at the reasons and i don t worry much about the occasional downvote but perhaps some readers think i m advocating cvs as a better system than svn or git
theses two links are great specially about to know more about the main reason of this header that is portability but for me what i like most about it that i think uint8_t is cleaner than unsigned chars for storing an rbg channel value for example int32_t looks more meaningfull than simply int etc
probably you can take a look at rythm template engine which is much faster than freemarker and velocity also much easier to use
it might not be the most efficient way to do it but i ve used ordereddictionary though sorteddictionary is probably more appropriate for handling the out of order issue in the past
an add action like that would be better done as a post request partly for semantic reasons it s sending data rather than get ting it and partly to avoid annoyances like this
newly created groups click more than 2 checkbox then a group button will appear now click the group button then an alert pop will appear asking you to enter group name.enter some name and click ok.then that name will now appear on the right side group table.now clcik the group name then those members will be selected.i want to the same from existing groups also.please tell me how
generally innodb is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to myisam there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that
for instance if the high word is less than the modulo then it is safe to perform the division like this
if the post has more than 9 pictures related to it i only get data from the first 9
but becuase reading from ram is usually faster than from other kind of memory storage divice os copy the program from disk on ram and start executing program from there
calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you
lastly if you are frequently finding yourself running long running process i advice you to try jruby which is works much better with long running processes due to jvm lot faster than mri
i am making a webrtc video call between a mobile and laptop the mobile is in portrait mode so it sends the stream with the height greater than width and the laptop send the stream with the aspect ratio reversed
then i thought of putting each integer from s into a binary search tree and searching for first occurence where one of children is smaller than query and parent is bigger than query but i don t know if this will work
mvc is the most extensible and if you are familiar with how things work under the covers you ll probably be better off than implements a hard to extends ms thing like odata and wcf
you can do the whole job in a single for-loop reading from stdin look if it is larger than the max smaller than the min and so you do not need the arrays
to summarise the differences controllers in the mvc have more control over the ui and handle events while a presenter in the mvp is more passive and just presents information through the ui
in my case i needed speed right out of the box and silex provided me with the speed and although i am using most of the symfony components it is a lot faster than symfony out of the box
i think the single responsibility principles srp is much more useful in practice -- as long as a class only does one thing it is okay to modify it if the requirements for that one thing change
during writing test for angular app using protractor i faced a lot of problem related to handling spinners some of then i solved but i don t know how to test spinners which hidden by wrapper for example if parent tag have ng-if or ng-hide statements and spinner has a height and width that is greater than 0
edit actually my solution does not work because double can be very big much bigger than int and also very small like fractions
you will probably find that bitvector performs a good deal better than bitarray
side note it looks like you re using the post form of file upload which as the docs say is considerably more complex than put
note also that onclick would be much more appropriate than onmouseup for this
if there are two rectangles and the parent is wider and than it is high then the children should be placed next to each other
if you want to cover the largest audience possible set up a streaming server like icecast and broadcast over mp3 and or ogg both is better
sometimes your mxml does not get you the itch of what you are looking and actionscript gives you more power
on the other hand for-loop is more like counter based where you want to specify for how many times should loops happened
comparator does everything that comparable does plus more
but do also remember that in your case get request looks more appropriate and as balusc says its not good practice to use post for bookmarkable page-to-page navigation
if you need to do more with the parent like paging or fetching the children you could split this problem into a sub query note that the line is not required it s just an example what you can further do with the query
disk space is probably always going to be cheaper than ram
nevertheless in my opinion break is not much better than goto its both not a good programming style
i have one parent resource which can have more than one children of one attrbiute and one than more children of other attribute
i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython
i would like to know how to only get the post that the user either hasn t read at all no record in views or the post latest_reply.id is bigger than the one saved in views
and i think post is better than get
but that seems like a ton of redundant code i m using squants to track units so there s more than just int and double to worry about that i d like to avoid if possible
i suggest you to give a look to tcpdf which is far better than fpdf also because it is actively developed
pull - do a asynctask in your android app such that whenever the app is opened it checks asynchronously if there are any upgrade by having a versioning code in a url and show a dialog to the user if the versioning code is greater than what it is in the device
another problem is you should have instead of || between comparisons you want it to be greater than min and also smaller than max
regarding your second example after the edit with the vector - using your getter setter makes even more sense than your original example as you want to give access to the values allow the user to change the values but not to the vector you don t want the user to be able to change the size of the vector
get requests are no less insecure than post requests
it s easy to use a gem for this such as devise which does a lot or sorcery which does less so may be easier to understand and alter as you like
whenever a top parent reply tile goes out of the viewport it is disposed as expected but when trying to bring it back into view it scrolls right to the top and looks very jumpy even worse whenever a bigger thread with multiple children tries to come back into view it doesn t scroll at all
on windows machine i would probably go with textpad personally i now use programmers notepad 2 however it does not support a spell checker and i don t really thinks it s better than textpad by any measure
of course you might be able to make the first step from long string to number easier by using nsscanner or by taking a substring of your long string cutting out everything except for the number itself and then using the nsstring method integervalue or doublevalue
i know there can be problems with posts_per_page but nothing is working i ve searched a lot to get the query to display more than one post
2 location + reverse geocoding - seems more reliable but requests location services on the device does it work on wifi only tablets and for it to be enabled and requires time to a fetch location b server call to reverse geocode
union is a shorter way to write union distinct
having getter and setter is a better thing in oop
use floating divs instead which looks like a modal dialog but are better than the pop-up
in safari we found that the dom level 0 took twice the time off the dom level 2 but was still four times faster than either firefox case
now i have it so that the line is split into an array of strings using the .split method however it splits on white space and punctuation meaning that cities with names longer than one words won t work
in studio 3 much of this sort of functionality is still coming as aptana is going more of a textmate bundle route for a great deal of their features which i think is really cool
unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro version of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions
also you can do this with textarea or better with pre html element
since you tagged this with python you might find rdflib more useful than jena but the real question here should be about how to do the conversion not the library request since library requests are off topic for stack overflow
neither post or get is securer than the other in that way and so if you need security you should use https
also as mentioned elsewhere show is a better option to css visibility as hide sets display none and not visibility
if you will only use put remove get it s better to choose map
is this something that would be easier with paperclip shrine or refile
if you re looking for more of a site-wide solution especially if you want the ui to do complex behaviors based on the url hash more than hide show a tab in one part of a page you might want to look into a proper javascript routing library like crossroads
i m trying to upload an image from my api to show it as profile picture the problem is from the first time that the user opens the navdrawer the image doesn t load and it makes the entire layout disappear but from the second time it all works and i notice that it happens when the width of the image is less than the height
since the screens of an ipad or other tablet is bigger than a phone s display and that would leave me with a bunch of open space i was wondering if there is something in codename one to have an image pop-up on a tablet but that it is not visible on a phone s display
after searched in google found that jackson has better performance than gson i plan to replace gson with jackson in my project but i got a diffrent result when run test code
a presenter is better to accept some kind of a view factories or a supplier in general as we can already hold an existing view especially in a gwt case and let the presenter decide when instantiate or accept the view
edit although this answer works it is little more than objective-c transliterated into swift
i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well
today gradle comes with a full-fledged dependency management implementation that no longer builds upon ivy except for some traces that haven t been removed yet for backwards compatibility reasons
i used to use dbcontext for all of my db models until i read ways to optimize entity framework after following the steps i found my self forced to switch to objectcontext instead so there were alot of code changes to be done but i am not sure that i doing the right thing specially after googling the deference i ve noticed that dbcontext is newer and better than objectcontext and also i noticed that i lost alot of things while switching to objectcontext like migrations and find method and much more.
in general the way to handle this issue with a managed bean is absolutely right but keep in mind that if you have to deal with big data it would be a performance problem because the programmatic way using java data objects including operations such as sorting filtering etc. is much more slower than to work with indexed data xp dominoview
avcapturesession is far more rudimentary compared to avaudiorecorder - it does not provide any recording facilities by itself for example and so if you wanted to also record the audio you would need to use an avassetwriter to save the samples
as expected the performance got better with both and avx 2 faster than sse 4.2 but when i profiled the code with papi i found out that the total number of misses mainly l1 and l2 increased a lot
if you want to use inherited properties it works more like this
some people use array.prototype.slice to do that but i m not a fan and i think a for-loop is faster in most browsers - but either way i have nothing against for loops and the slice often feels like a hack to me
for a person who sees this there is also nothing wrong min is less than max
if you forget to use this and your default umask is more restrictive or less restrictive then you will need to re-run the non- sudo
it can be even shorter with show and hide
found a way to make sure the mouseleave mouseout works better
hiding state behind getter and setter gives you more flexibility to change the internal representation of the class state without breaking other classes that uses the state
the article painting in awt and swing goes into more detail
but if i take it out of range for more than 1 min it gives an exception
while you are at it you might want to try the hikaricp database connection pool instead of c3p0 i suspect hikaricp is better at recovering from broken database connections
regearding your comment i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg that is not really the case
1 might not yet be sparse enough to make this better compared to just a plain bitarray assuming longs storing 64 bits each it doesn t take more than 2 longs to have more than one bitset on average but if the sparsity increases beyond that the space and time savings will show
i have tried with sublimetext 2 and it work very very good better than gedit p
we don t actually multiplying it s slower than simple addition and as you can see we destroy temporary register t0 but don t touch s0 s1
you should treat submit as what happens after you ve done any pre-processing so binding to click events then conditionally raising the submit is better than always submission but conditionally stopping the submit
nginx is quicker though honestly you ll struggle to see the difference except for very high volume sites and has quickly become the web server of choice for a lot of people if you don t have any specific need for apache for your code
i think you should install phpmyadmin on your server this will allow you to access your database from work school cafe etc mysql-workbench is more advanced and gives you more features so you can deal with changing the structure and editing any rows columns relations and much more look at phpmyadmin s features it has most if not all
i ve got a script for ensuring the user doesn t check more than 4 checkbox but i can t find a way to ensure that the submit button is disabled if they have selected less than 4 items
i think put and get on ignite cache would likely to be slower than native put and get on my inbuilt key value store
mouseenter and mouseout afterwards is cheaper for what you are doing and fires it s event only once
the quotation you brought up just claim that maven does more than ant so that it s not fair to compare the two
if all you need is a different layout for portrait and landscape there s an easier way to do this
i am guessing that it happens because the size of int is larger than that of chars as such the memory controller the thing which controls memory in c -i don t know the technical term has to move a larger distance
ant is older and while it is still used in a number of projects it is rapidly losing ground to maven
i am basically trying to send out an email if a certain data point is greater than or less than a max and min point respectively on the sheet
more over it seems that get requests are more lightweight than post under high load
even if underlying implementation is not so different memcpy is much faster because it does not have to check what it s copying strncpy will stop when it ll copy the end of string character null
ok so i m trying to see if an image s width is greater than it s height then apply a class if not apply another class
hex is easy octal is even easier to convert to and you dont need to do the backward thing for a quick check can reverse it by hand after you see the result
but then sorting by age grouping ak is more difficult i think
i admit i only skimmed the rfc link but it looks like more than one spaces can be used as a delimiter so you might want to change those to +
i cannot tell if this happens in ie or edge also because it never happen to me with them but i m using them rarely because i m more accustomed with google-chrome and firefox s web developer tools - source console etc
the consensus seems to be that corona is easier to use but that cocos2d-x has the advantages that come from being open source easy to customize merge with other code community etc
however even this version is about 2-3 times faster than using sin and cos on every iteration
all in all jackson is considered to be faster but i ve also read that gson gives better performance when working with large objects
do i just create a new uiview that is 4px larger than the selected object and and make the selected view a subviews of it
by the way the code with show hide is also more readable
if you want to batch and parfor at the same time open one less worker with matlabpool than you otherwise would
but settimeout would be better than setinterval because with setinterval if your previous ajax request is not complete and you start another request there will have multiple requests which would sooner be problematic
i just recently switched databases to postgresql which has given me a slew of problems although i must admit i like it a lot better than mysql
one thing to note is the soak time you have for your application - if it is big then you might have to provision for more machines with ram and disk
i know that teamcity has a way of achieving this but i think that jenkins is more constrictive
i m sure there are other holes like that too - but the code above will work on any system which supports paging and where disk access is much more expensive than ram access
in a native application i would use udp for the most data player position ... because it s way faster than tcp and it s uncritical when it is lost
be the result of form data probably url_encoded and use the correct request method get is perfectly correct but coming from an html from post is much more common
update3 now it works here which means that i couldn t fully reproduce my bug to show it to you but in general the problem is that the height of 5x5 table in google-chrome is less from firefox on 22px which is 22px gap between table container and a table itself
before we move on i just wanted to mention that spring oauth2 already provides an implementation for the above interface meaning that we could make our life a lot easier by actually extends the only implementation of the above interface clientdetails which is org.springframework.security.oauth2.provider.client.baseclientdetails rather than implements it from the beginning leverage all that can be done from baseclientdetails and add our own custom fields hence the myclientdetails looks as follow then
it is said that if you have a mostly read based application you should use myisam as it is better than innodb
mousedown mouseup is indeed the only way you can get notified of middle button interaction so detecting a down-then-up event without intervening mouseout event is more or less the best you can do
in your example fn is attempting to call call but it s not specifying the context which typically defaults to the window object but in this case it just makes it undefined which triggers a weird error in google-chrome as you discovered but firefox is clearer about the problem
note that if you have json and rest then retrofit is going to be better than pure okhttp
my thought is javascript show hide option is better for usability and the customers journey especially on mobiles
if there are more than one parent div elements that have three or more such children then all of the 3rd children are selected
i understand that laravel is what s hot right now but i ve never played with it and am not sure if learning laravel is more time-effective vs using codeigniter which i know pretty well but just doesn t excite me any more
you might want to look at one of these options if you re running in a vm since xfce is slightly lighter weight than gnome although not all that much lighter these days
then you should achive them with a counter and maybe a for-loop is better then while loops
has more than 500 post and get the feed of each category
ntfs filesystems actually supports longer names 32k but there is no easy way to allow long names for programs
neither one of get and post is inherently more secure than the other just like neither one of fax and phone is more secure than the other
anyway i just set the margin to a value a little bigger than the width of the image and overlap is eliminated only in the very specific case we want
i ve copied a file over to a ram disk but i get an error message that doesn t make sense as the path is actually shorter than on the physical disk and is certainly less than 260 characters
i found jackson better than gson performance project activity better docs ...
i realize this is an older post but we just ran into the same issue and resolved it by setting the z-index of the bubble pop-up to something higher than the dialog window
when you add more than 5 uiviewcontroller objects to your uitabbarcontroller ios will automatically create the more button for you
since you already learned c++ you should use something more serious such as tbb or ppl
you allow children on either side of a node to contain keys that are neither less than nor greater than the parent
you could try running it in pypy - for some cases it can be significantly faster than cpython
in inheritance the father should not access the methods of the children it is better to inherit and implement new methods that have nothing to do with the parent in the child class
the ctrl key is usually close by my keyboard hand and in combination with the mouse is faster than the page up page down keys
please notice how the family cell stretches to house more than one parent rows and the parent cell streches to house more than one children rows
my question is how can i execute more than 1 prepare statement
for the stand of file operations writing to memory ram is always faster than writing to the file on the disk directly
i think what you re asking for is how to return the information for all the images where the height is greater than the width
srt is simpler than ass but lacks features so you may need to use the force_style option in the subtitle filter
if you want to accept a number rather than a digit and only a number strtol works much better than atoi as it allows you to check for failures
but as programs grow and structs deepen keeping track of what s been malloc d where and what s appropriate to free gets harder and harder
having used it myself in my opinion it s also far nicer than swing in its api more like swt in that respect looks far nicer by default and far more flexible in what it allows you to do
i m concerned this is going to get worse as we put more tests into the specflow project
in mobile platforms except larger screens as on tablet the affix would be disabled entirely and the page would only rely on the responsiveness of the grid
anyway you will have a huge performance loss due to the fact that your disk is way slower than your ram
i want to create a custom validation but i cant found any documentation about that i know how to get the width and height of an image but i don t know how to validate and prevent to add that file if the width is bigger i want to do that on the front side with the library
prism is more of a modularity framework and caliburn is more of a mvvm framework i know both have overlapping features but it would be great to take best features from two frameworks when they are combined
maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it
also if you can do the above you can probably just as easily turn your code into a for-loop which seems more appropriate given your desire to a break out of loops b use the operator to cause side effects
but if you want some header functions in header column like sorting or filtering that is more complicated and you have to implement by your own
udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag
i made a docker image to use it with my builds of a project in wercker i did this because i thought having the require packages already installed in the environments is better than installing them in each build of my project
alternate way is to use awt - which is an older and worse technology than swing and in that case you can t use flowlayout - it puts all the components into one row
when the alu gets a command to subtract it is given 2 numbers - it makes a not to every bit of the second number and makes a simple addition and adds 1 more because 2 s complement is not to every bit +1
as landscape has lesser space than portrait you are able to view only top scrollview so only that portion would be scrollable
hope you get the more clarification by this post
or generally speaking is it possible to add the same children to more than one parent
as an example my android tablet s stock video player app has a feature that allows it to be less than full screens
i still have to do more testing with the multiplication and division but other than that it seems to be working well
if you plan for long term i don t see more options than swt or swing for gui development in java
are you using the jquery ui accordian or using the jquery accordian which is more or less a series of show and hide which is used more commonly i would think
it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others
i m doing a project at university which i decided to do in javafx as it is more stylish than swing but i m having difficulty to find an alternative to the filledoval library for the canvas awt as i can t use the canvas awt in javafx
java tends to be much more verbose than swift so i doubt what i m asking is too broad it is more likely that i don t know how to use the objective-c messagecomposer object because the documentation that i linked to above is unclear with regard to usage in swift
i have just spent a few days playing around with web2py and really like it and i am wondering if django offers something more that i am missing out on
the while loops is essentially the same thing implemented differently but in this situation the for-loop looks cleaner and easier to follow
i noticed that when i flip my phone from portrait to landscape everything gets bigger
or you can add a pop-up dialog which is more customizable
i got it to work by using a child process from pexpect which is much more flexible than telnetlib
also i am not sure why everyone is suggesting onblur isn t onchange is better for validation purpose
but if you are allowed to store whole tree into memory you can use lxml.html which is faster than beautifulsoup
first let me say that i m more experienced with verilog but have been plugging away with vhdl for awhile trying to fix this issue
often google-chrome is understanding more thing then it should and firefox is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh
for fat filesystems that s less complicated but still you ll have to study the fs for a while
this actually happens more commonly with tcp connections but i see no reason udp can t have this problem as well
where the parent can have one or more children many but the child can exist without a parent but it can never have more than one parent zero or one
another thing that bothers me is why in nhibernate always it is being used ilist and not ienumerable which has less functionality
my stackoverflow search indicates that it can be turned off by setting setopt nonomatch then zsh behaves more like bash glob the pattern and pass it to the program if no match is found
trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible
i have used this pattern with apache before and nginx seems more capable in most respects so i m sure this must be possible
so then i think to go with that approach i would end up with a for-loop and loads of add calls but surely that is even worse than the arrays copy isn t it
i found something that works here but if the index number is higher than the children count the element goes out of the parent
addclass removeclass is far more efficient since it contains all the styling externally where it s easy to add remove that styling to the element when needed
however if you re making a pop-up dialog it s better to detect if the user is not on a mobile device then use the css position fixed
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable
this is to learn something new but also because it seems like implementing maven within ant is less of a standard than is just pure maven.
and also apple does might not confidently announce that swift is more faster than objective-c in all the cases
initially the value of button is disable because value of button is true so the button is disabled.after selecting the checkbox now the button should be able to click
as far as i know the division is more complex and slower than other operations like addition so is my code incorrect then
if the code doesn t run on php 5.2+ then you can t use a current phpunit versioning which is definitely more of a concern and my first general recommendation is to find any issues an php 5 upgrade might bring
for radio button and checkbox it is better to use change events using .on event handler attachment
and each post have a like_count integer field i want to get users along their post that has more that n post which is liked more that m times i do
since i am more familiar with jackson here are some aspects where i think jackson has more complete support than gson apologies if i miss a gson feature
settimeout is better than setinterval here because setinterval will start at every 5 secs but settimeout will start once each time your job is done and wait for 5 seconds which will make your script adaptive to server response timings
if smallest state of all children is greater than parent s state then update parent
division may be heavier than multiplication but a commenter pointed out that reciprocals are just as fast as multiplication on modern cpus in which case this isn t correct for your case so if you do have 1 x appearing somewhere inside a loop and more than once you can assist by caching the result inside the loop and then using y
so far this works how i wanted on google-chrome but it doesnt look the same when on firefox and looks even worse on ie 10
the reason i ask is i am running proficy ifix 5.0 and when i run aero it adds annoying scrollbars to everything as the titlebar of the window is bigger than it normally is
multiple child entities to a single parent is even more simple because then each child has a reference to its parent but as compound columns and list types are not defined in sql a parent can t contain a list of its children
i d have one project team responsible for localization which may well involve more than just translation - different countries have different legal requirements currencies payment providers etc. and one team for improving the code base
you can also supply a timeout for these requests meaning any requests that run longer than the timeout window will be terminate after all
on the other hand relaxing from private to protected public is less traumatic because you don t have to worry about previous access to that property from without that class
mouseover rather than on mousedown makes it easier to catch moving
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post
you don t need to write any new members - it s just a marker interface - but there are other methods you can add to give more control over serializable and deserialization
so basically when box2d is more about how objects will behave themselves during application running the scene2d is more about how you write your code before application running
there are many optimizations possible like for instance checking whether the difference of min and max is more than one inside the loop and if that is the case return false immediately
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs
since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loop than you would in the multiplication loop
but if there are less birds than the minimum spawns to wait for an argument out of range error would be thrown
the only problem is when i hover the parent the children is blinking more like fading out and then fading in again the jquery is doing this but i dont know to fix this
since you float the content to the left and the sidebar to the right changing the margin won t have an effect unless maybe it gets bigger than the available width of the gap but certainly not while the margin is smaller than the gap that is already there
edit i was hoping not to turn this into another flame war but i guess that s inevitable so i will just say that i have considerably more experience with autotools and no desire to learn cmake or scons or imake or ant although i seem pretty much stuck with the latter when working with java these days or whatever new tool is invented next year or the year after
is there a better way than show hide that would be easier on the memory performance
the size of maven jar is bigger then ant jar i don t know why help me please
i have an expanding contracting table view.my parent cells have a different style than the children cell parent cells have bigger font children cell has smaller font
eventually i went back to post because we needed the fix quick but it has been bugging me because semantically a get is more correct in this case
perhaps you find it strange since the target droppable s size is much smaller than the draggable
that is pointless if you are expecting more than one output from your resultset you need something more than a jtextfield maybe a jtable
my solution to the range part feels clunky over complicated and doesn t check if the max range value is bigger than the min range value doesn t check if 10 2
i guess the point that the article is trying to make here is that a facade is easier to implement when you already have this command-pattern in place
of course as a general rule it s highly recommended to wrap your ajax calls in a unified method that concatenates the csrf token to the request be it get or post although post is safer and much more correct from architectural perspective so when you make ajax calls you focus on the business input values only and don t need to worry about csrf
for example exposing the students property in swift means different places can all modify it and the delegate would be notified also it s not clear to the coder that setting students property would trigger a delegate notification for averagescore whereas having a dedicate method in objective-c makes it more clear
uu-parsinglib is definitely worth the time to explore but i would suggest that getting familiar with parsec first is the better course for these reasons
also it seems jackson lib has better performance than other packages such as gson which i haven t tried personally
based on this answer here s how you can simulate a double click using mousedown mouseup mouseup is probably better since click is fired after the user lifts their mouse and not when they first press it
a heap is a data structure that maintains only the property that all parent are less than their children or all parent are greater than their children
however it is not possible to rotate in the current situation since both children end up in becoming lesser than a parent
by promoting the mating of more similar parent the children are less likely to be much worse than the parent because the parent just were compatible
jackson is more suitable if you have a complex deep json tree because gson creates a lot of temporary objects which leads to stop the world gcs
what i do not understand is why the size of the point and the text is not the same and why the margin can be bigger than the width of the figure
it s just a supposition but try recreating the form widget onsuccess or even hide the form onsubmit actually onclick is better and show another form to the user
an item can have multiple children and can also have more than one parent
edit as gregs points out in the comments you cannot be sure that the private exponent of the key you want to encrypt is smaller than the modulo of the key you want to use to encrypt with
if vim seems too much by the moment i think that kate is better than gedit
you can do this either in a push or pull based fashion pull is probably simpler just poll for changes
modern operating systems usually get in the way especially if the file is larger than ram you will end up swapping code since the system will treat your already stored on disk data as swappable
type book why do we need anything more than http get put post
svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well
manytoone if you plan to have a tree as a parent can have more than one children
when you use post data is a alot more safer than get and you can send large no
swift in that case would not be safer but less safe than objective-c
if in-order processing is required a much better design would be to use another message processing library that supports a pull model which i think would fit your scenario much better than rebus push model
so if i modify the nsurl path with a new image because nsdata bytes is already greater than 0 i don t make the additional call to fetch the new image
for example post request are considered more secure than get request as creating a post request is relatively harder than creating a get request
there is a lot of already done frameworks like flask and django that gives you more power easily
when you analyze a program with valgrind memcheck it requires more than twice as much memory than the program would do by itself
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has
if puma or unicorn makes this easier or more robust i d love to hear that
scheme is intentionally more compact than common lisp and you ll find that you can learn the language very quickly
this is of course subjective but i think learning common lisp or standard scheme is generally more useful just for the simple fact that you then will not be limited to one compiler
cypher seems much more clear to me than gremlin and in general it seems that the guys in neo4j are going with cypher
instead of using a uitableview in this instance perhaps you might consider using a uicollectionview - they are built for something like you describe more than a uitableview
other than the fact that get has one character less than post i doubt there is any performance difference
this means that once you can t scale vertically any more by adding ram disk speed etc to a single server you will have to be careful about how you choose to shard
if you want to get data from simple list thnn foreach loops is good to use but if you want to data from exact position or to store from id than for-loop is better
cos itself seems to be consistently a tick 0 01 better than sin but the case distinction to reconstruct the sign has an extra test
often especially when using mink to test web applications you will find that behat goes faster than your web application can keep up - it will try and click links or perform actions before the page has had chance to load and therefore result in a failing test that would have otherwise passed
that s basically possible but it would take hours as hard disk access is so much slower than accessing ram caches
also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql
using dedicated methods for getting and setting properties is also more clear in inherited
the plugin defaults to requiring a post request to logout but using the config setting you reference you can make your application more convenient to use but less secure by allowing get or post requests
this allows me to keep all of my models from having to inherited from a base class that has a messages properties and gives me more flexibility
post is better but if you want it to be truly restful you should ensure that the uri uniquely identifies the resource and use put
this shouldn t come as any surprise - there are more long values than double given the nan values and plenty of double aren t int so we can t expect every long to be exactly representable
the code in the setter is far more interesting than the getter should it not take precedence and be defined first
but since division is pretty expensive i think that this is even worse than 2 multiplication
my linq query return type would be more adequat with ienumerable int it works when i do this but i was wondering if i could mix in the same array list queries that would have handle strings double or whatsoever.
it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each
personally i m using emacs right now which i find easier than vim for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste
if you want the users to select only one option perhaps a dropdown or radio button list is more suitable rather than checkbox
i know django forms uses post but in this instance i feel that get is more appropriate which means i don t have to use django forms but does that mean i also don t have to validate the data
making the members private and providing getter and setter is no better than making them public in the first place okay it s a bitter better for debugging purposes but conceptually it s the same
it works by returning your entry to what it was before - if you enter a key that results in the value being less than min or more that max
4 some email providers might mark that email as spam however most spam checks are based on spf and dkim checks more than email existence checks
also note that using post is absolutely not more secure than get because the request parameters aren t immediately visible in url
with really basic calls to the database iqueryable is way quicker but when do i need to think about using an ienumerable in its place
example the salt field might only allow a 64 characters while the generated salt might be longer therefore when you save the salt it gets trimmed which ultimately changes the hash password
personally i d say yii might have the edge as it encourages convention more than codeigniter would
i need help in a vba macro that ll delete files in a directory that contains more than 2 _ and is older than 3 months old however there are some folder sub folder in the directory that must not be touched or modified
am passing the word asdasdasd to the text area with the id source and triggering the click event.after that trying to check whether the result value which is wrapped under the newly created span tag or not.for that am checking whether its parent with the id result_box has more than one children
in its stead you can use isotope - which does filtering a lot easier than masonry
for this reason it seemed natural to me to initially load the file into memory and interpret it later at my leisure since reading from ram is supposed to be much faster than from disk
i don t know how safe could it be and how difficult is for the hacker to determinate the technique i use the thing is that the result has the same length as the hash and is harder to determinate a salt so if for any reason in the history hacker uses a rainbow table and catches a probable result it will be the wrong
curl commands seem to work as do some other post commands from older code but when i log out req.body all i get is
the max heap is an array that could be more easily represented with a binary tree where the parent node is always greater than it s children and every time you add a child you added it towards the left so that every time the tree increases it s height it is a full tree
disadvantages again if a parent can have a row that relates to more than one children data will be duplicated as there will be one row per each of them so there is a limitation in this solution
i assume this is because either e.x or e.y is no longer either greater than 0 or less than the height or width which is what i was trying to check with the iswithin function
specifically you compare the new root with the left and right children and keep swapping if the parent is larger than at least one of the children until the heap property is satisfied
stick with post on any action that does more than get data avoid xss-issues
i would like to be able to let children have more than one parent
now - your i7 cpu have 4 cores + hyperthreading which results in more threads spawned for processing thus you can get more exceptions because for example 4 things can be processed at the same time when exception occurs
if you want to have all all shortest paths from all nodes to all other nodes you can just run dijkstra from each node or you can try bellman-ford which is bit faster but a little bit harder to grasp
you can have more than one get post etc per resources by defining different routes
get is basically for just getting retrieving data a get should not have a body so aside from cookies the only place to pass info is in the url and urls are limited in length get is less secure compared to post because data sent is part of the url
i m wondering if there s a way to effectively force a type on instance variables rather their setter and getter that s easier than manually defining them
since you don t need animation and want to stay with loss-less compression you would get somewhat better compression with png instead of gif and png is patent-free
as we use less i was thinking about using a condition where i could specify that if the height of the children is higher than the parent s height the background-color is different
i had the idea to switch automatically between get and post for example if cookie set because get is more fast and cache able and post is more save
test code updated so you can see that both it works identically whether using varargs or not will fail if your home directory has less than 5 sub folder
these two are completely different logically speaking and you should choose only one of them to go further with note that swt is more customizable and tries to combine the best from awt and swing while swing is more limited and uses the platform s native widgets
from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked
if you want to have content synchronized between all the microservices in your case the header and footer i d suggest zookeeper it s designed for distributed orchestration and has more of a push model - you d update the header in zookeeper and all of your services would receive that update almost instantly
note that at time of writing rouge has lesser language support compared to pygments
2 caf seems a little better than wav but not much
note that a quadtree can be queried very quickly and efficiently but updates are a bit more costly that is if your items move a lot across your map this becomes more complicated to do with a good performance
sometimes a class attribute could have more than one getter or setter let s illustrate with a silly short example
the code below works perfectly but it takes more than 10 min to loop through all named range
so even if your ram is much smaller than your disk you could assume you can read data that s already in ram 90 of the time or more
post is also more commonly used for partial updates as put generally implies sending a full new representation of the resource
firefox has even fewer as far as i know and opera has none
here the content for the length item is this is a super duper long snippet because we need to see how labels behave when they more than barely extends onto multiple lines. the content for the power cycle item is have you tried turning it off and back on again
but goto is better than break when you have nested loops like that
the client post scores and fetches highscore lists from the server and everything seemed to be working perfectly we had been testing it for a month with no problems and the code is really simple with not much more than a put get
since socks proxy is in theory nothing more than a ssl tunnel i thought i could give that property another try
a post request can include all the information that a get request does plus more which makes it seem like it should be able to do everything get can do plus more
if picasso doesn t satisfy you for any reason you can also try android-query which does much more than picasso it s not only for images but the same rules apply
finally i haven t done much with animation but i think you re entirely correct - d3.js provides more animation support than protovis especially in terms of animated transitions
as of a few years ago multiplying was 3x slower than add
if the left children must be strictly less than their parent then duplicate keys form a linked list that works like a single node since you can t have any left children in it
bluff charts get really weird when scaled to more than 800px flot has a very limited api and the tooltips on multi axis dont work plotkit and jquery visualize doesnt have tooltips and i couldnt find any good documentation on gpraphael my best shot was jqplot which was meeting all my needs until i tried to print it on paper they print unaligned
the reason we only traverse a tree from the parent to the children is because we are usually searching for a specific node and as long as the binary tree is implemented such that all left children are less than the parent and all right children are greater than the parent or vice-versa we only need links in one direction to find that node
tripledes is generally not recommended because aes gives better security more efficiently you might like to see some comparative timings of block ciphers that i took in java to see just how bad it is
it works nicely but from the rich ui perspective it s boring so i was wondering since the draggable image is bigger than the droppable how could i do assuming it s possible to have the droppable container suck the bigger image until if fills its dimensions
the repeater is still faster than the gridview but the difference shouldn t be big if you code it right
this is a draft i made and where i m stuck at - from the fact that we have distinct elements and the heap property we know that the parent is always greater than its children
it s hard to guess whether this will really be slower or faster than using strcpy followed by strlen though
i remember it says something like division takes much much more time than addition
i ve only done one experiment with angular material myself and i wasn t experiencing any real performance issues at the time but i did read some people writing about it being slower than plain ionic
note i know the jxtable variant of jtable has some more options for filtering and highlighting rows but i did not find a solution yet.
i don t think this capability utf8mb4 exists in mysql 5.1 as evidenced by the query below making this yet another reason why you never run a versioning on a slave that is lower than the versioning on the master and when doing upgrade you always want to upgrade the slave first
in such a case passing by value may no required actually passing anything at all -- the value that s passed is basically little or nothing more than a placeholder for this is the object
but if you re dealing with children that have more than one parent then you re dealing with graphs and for that reason mysql it s not suitable for you
however if you re developing a serious application sdl is more likely to be the tool you need to use as glut abstracts more than a real application would normally want to
i understand you are trying to load more events that are currently shown on screens so that they are cached and prev next switching works faster
not totally sure what you want to do but using a while checking if the user input is equal to next and if not trying to cast to int using a try except is a better idea
over the last year it looks like mongoid has been more regularly maintained and updated than mongomapper
if there exists a np-hard problem that is not in np to the best of my knowledge no such problem has been proved to fall in this category at this moment of time such problem is harder than np-complete problems
more importantly in this case i think post is more appropriate than put
i run the ab test several times with same results post is faster but get is lighter
remove the directory if the date contained in the folder name is older than 3 months
i ve even tried to pin archetypes and atcontentypes so that the buildout uses older versions example those used in plone 4.2 by adding the following to my pinnedversions.cfg file which gets called after everything else
im trying to take an array of type t and switch its values around so it correctly corresponds to the rules of a heap where the parent is always greater than the 2 children
i ve got a responsive ad unit on my page and for some reason it has a height of 60px while i really need it to be 90px and switching to 300x250 when screens gets smaller
directory.getcurrentdirectory will give you the current folder which is more of a context as you can create a shortcut and pass a completely different folder as your current directory than the one where your exe is present
i personally would use aes for my encryption as it is lighter and more secure than tripledes in fact i think it is the de facto algorithm at the moment
i am using icheck plugin to make my checkbox and radio button looks better
i was wondering if you guys could help me with a function i m trying to make to determine whether an unsigned integer a is bigger than b
i could just throw away customsetup and put all the custom code after super but having that abstract method makes clearer what you re supposed to put there
if you can get that to work you might want to try progressively removing the height width position attributes from div.header to get the minimal required attributes to get the effect you want
though your for-loop seems to be okay but may be your are trying to access some index inside loops which is 1 more than the current x value at some point
the operating system will give your program all the resources it needs the reason your process is not consuming all the cpu is probably because it s waiting for the io sub system more than the processors
maybe it is but it is much easier than launchd agent in other session from daemons when implemented right with different corner cases support
and last if you know the number of loops it is much easier and better to read when you use a for-loop instead of a while loops
if i don t have a grammar i ll use parsec it is more flexible powerful than happy and its more fun to work in haskell than generate code with happy and alex
in simple words we can say performance of repeater is far better than gridview
any db tech is fine with me as long it does not need lots of ram and uses less disk
post is more secure than get this is just a quick example
i am setting the policy to constrained-resize to get rid of the extra column based on this so post tableview has more columns than specified
in case of min heap when you insert the element which is less than some nodes in the tree the data structure now doesn t follow heap condition in case of min heap value of parent should be less than its children so you have to shift up and up
i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get
reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly
the comaddin base class makes it a bit easier to create an office add-in and reduce infrastructure code to be more familar with vsto - thats the whole idea
i d send an action from the child to the parent it s always easier to communicate upstream than it is downstream due to the fact that parent don t always have children
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking
you should always use the timeit module for time trials it is far more accurate than cprofile here
make the form get not post because the request is not changing anything on the server so get verb is more appropriate and also the get verb will pass all the form values as a query string parameters so you ll get the desired effect
it is important to give additional space to the ram disk that is 10 bigger than the size of the jvm
to get more help with that post information about your table structures and content
is not simple scale or crop but to be able to rotate scale and crop every single sprite and draw it in the exactly order to compose the final hight resolution image in a backbuffer then save it in bmp and make some copies in lower resolution as png
what i am hoping to get from this post is a better way to do this or hopefully someone can tell me why is happening i know that the latter might be hard since it can be a bunch of reasons
the difference between post and put is less about creating vs
bigger better than wordpress you re typically looking at joomla or drupal there are others these are just the most common ones
in my opinion a for-loop is usually better for doing something a specific number of times and if you re just iterating over every item in an arrays foreach is usually more straightforward
it may not be the most elegant method but when you just need to convert something ad-hoc thinking of it as comparison and subtraction may be easier than division
issue you re experiencing with a video working in landscape but not portrait sounds more like an issue with the email client than your code
note that if you convert your png files to gif images they are likely to look uglier as gif files can only have 256 colors and do not support alpha-transparency
i am asked to apply to all the actions of one mvc project for security reason says post is more secure than get which i disagree with
when there is more than 1 checkbox s they do not work as a group like radio button such that only one 1 radio button can be selected when there is more than 1
so for creating a friendship post method suits better than get
i was thinking that there could be an issue if the result from the addition is bigger than what 15 bits can represent 32767 or if i get a negative number in the subtraction
a while loops makes more sense to me than your use of a for-loop
is there anything more i should do more than changing post to get
while this is perfectly acceptable its typically how i do it unless there are more than one chars in a row alignment issues will force the next variable to waste 1-3 bytes anyway which could otherwise have been used for free by an int
my main and pretty noob question is it ok from an mvp perspective to have a presenter that communicates with more than one interactor or should just be one interactor per presenter
i have a comment on your for-loop q is never considered in the stopping condition therefore putting it within loops is more logical in my opinion
first its not a bad idea to use node.js to satisfy your requirement the uniqueness of node and added advantage compared to conventional technologies like apache-php is clearly explained in this following video why node.js is better .the notion of node being just used for advanced or complex applications is wrong you can use node for building applications which are very simple to anything of huge proportion.it would be a not so comfortable task for a node beginner to code without using any frameworks but by using this web application framework called express you need not code from scratch and its very easy to setup html pages using its simplified html templating language called jade and route requests also you can even use your html pages if you are not willing to use jade for rendering the views of your application .here are the series of tutorials which would help you tutorials on beginning with node.js basics of expressjs
i would prefer the 1st one since maintaining 1 value of parent is easier efficient than maintaining list of all children
imperative is the traditional step by step recipe approach while declarative is more this is what i want now you work out how to do it
if you re using older versioning it is better to upgrade and avail benefits of c++11 features as much as possible
some background i m learning haskell now having earlier worked with scheme and cl and a little foray into clojure
i am trying to make my html page tablet compattible by trying to hide the menu if width is less than height it works when page loads but when i change the orientation of tablet the menu div remains at its place
now if you aren t generating your html server-side and are instead writing it by hand you can make your life just a dash easier with a client-side transformation like this
i think i generally agree with your summary - it makes sense that postandasyncreply is slower than post so if the caller doesn t need to get a notification from the agent when the operation such as putting value into the queue completes it should definitely expose a way to do that using just post
i m not totally sure what you are asking malloc minus free is less than the actual usage because of the memory fragmentation if you really need that number you have to use custom allocators which are tiny wrappers around existing ones everywhere in your code which is going to be painful
i have a form with multiple checkbox and a button by default the button will be disable but after checking at least 2 or more than 2 checkbox the button should become active
if you are worried about memory then do look into scikit-learn since equivalent models can use significantly less memory than nltk
from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows
in minitest i could add this check for each class with 1 line include diameterizableinterfacetest. in rspec it takes 4 more lines
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv
we sort of settled on it but later found codelite and liked it better than codeblocks
keeping your business logic in ejb jar will pay off when you ll need more than one war in your ear different security realms etc.
feed dialog is more intrusive in the sense that it has a facebook pop-up window
i have a program an awt frame yes i know that swing is better but i am restricted from using it that has 2 moving objects
an entity can have more than one children but a single parent at most
the rss feed-splitter component of mule returns only a single item even if the feed has more than one items if the pubdate for all the items is same
the internal view hierarchy of uialertview is much more complicated than it appears and starting from ios 7 it is not even added to any uiwindow so it s no big surprise that it doesn t participate to the responder chain as you expect
when i test the app with 2gb of allocated memory instead of 12gb i saw that the performance of the cpu when using ram is better than when using ram disk when i just write data into my db 15 vs 17 cpu usage
why don t you do a simple test that tries to read and display an image in a jlabel first since using a jtable is more complicated than using a jlabel
it seems that you are just printing too much and it seems to come from the third inner for-loop and also in other cases when the height is more than the width possible from the fourth for-loop
you d still have to filtering to get a range though it ought to be faster than sorting at least
you really might need to up cast everything into a double and then check to see if the result is greater than or less than an int
i think you can best use the for-loop this gives you a little bit more control over loops
so just change your versioning to something else which must be greater than the upgrade versioning so that again first condition will be false and system will not check further and will connect without using tls
if the parent however is not larger then its children you won t notice any difference between those alignments
fixing bugs in swt is much harder than in swing most classes in swt are final or contain hostile checks in the constructor to make sure no one extends them the package is signed so you can t simply replace classes and so far i tried several times to compile swt from sources - and failed
if you want to show more than 2 screens you might have to use a number and extend a handlebars function that can be use a switching statement to test for different values to show different content
this gives me but when i loop through it i get duplicated parent when this parent has more than one children
i am using the compareto method in java to try and check if a certain date is greater than or equals than 24 hours after another date
if your .so are statically linked to c++ runtimes - you should free objects in the same module where they were allocated since new delete is something more than malloc free and need some extra info to work properly
i can order by id but this doesn t feel reliable as even though i know in this case that children will have a higher id than their parent i can t guarantee this will always be the case in every circumstance i want to use a cte
ok i think i may have fixed my problem i changed the logic and so i m now using a for-loop i could have still used a while-loop but i think a for-loop is better
reloading pages data or program code from disk which is much slower does not usually happen very often as long as the program is actually running and as long as the machine is not desperately low on ram
you need to just change the siftdown function so that the parent is always the smaller than the children
depending on the rest of your code you might be better off with getter and setter
it iterates through the most recent folder returned by the dir command each returned on one line and after it encounters the 4th it stops if there are more than 4 folder
if you start with zero and multiplying it by whatever number s it stays zero -- it s not a neutral starting point for a series of multiplication it s more of a fixed point a black hole in a sense
then either use a shader with a uniform to select which corner of the texture to display or else make a quad for each corner with pre baked uvs to select which part of the video to display
i m starting in the base directory and i know that the the directory goes no more than 1 folder deep past the base directory
basically it equates the number of topics to the number of post so i always get x topics and x post if post is greater than 0
you can then add datediff and a case statement to flag a new login where the difference is greater than your threshold
hence post is more secure than get
on an unencrypted connection post is no more secure than get
this will only return error if the deepend is less than the min and greater than the max which could never really happen testing your code -
are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa
the problem here is the parent z-index is lower than the mask so any children are always behind the mask
generally a pop-up is a better option for a login dialog and a pop-up would allow you to easily navigate to the main page
c++ s stl is getting better and better yet it s not nearly as huge as boost and is not intended to
using getter and setter gives you more control over the validity of your objects giving you the option of testing values that are set to ensure that they are reasonable etc
everything is better than a checkbox or a button with autopostback set to true nowadays in year 2011 2012 soon
from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb
in addition to that the crossing off may be less work than a division don t know about python it is for c arrays
1 if i copy more than one folder to the watched directory one of them will get handled none of the others will get processed
you may need to also add another bit to the child2 join to remove the possibility of parent having a higher rating than the children
child components have weaker connection with its parent than subcomponents it was expected that parent has no idea how many children it can have which is appropriate for most controls
even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio
if the current child s bottom is lower than his parent take it and all the following children and put them in a new div content
we have now turned our multiplication into an addition which is much easier to do
due to the work flow change our qa members would like to have finer control over the push pull operation on the release server they d like to allow only specified user s with user credential s to access to specified repo s
supply more data upon post and receive less data upon get
if your in to python there is nltk as already mentioned by it s author but there is also scikit-learn which provides much more than just clustering
but if the action is aimed to handle crud request post or put it s more convenient way to use forms
now you can get all those same features with flask if you re prepared to do some integration work but the argument can just as easily be made that django is better for beginners precisely because it does come with all those things built-in
using the ajax method really shouldn t take much more than using post get
based on my understanding i hope that is because the size of the tablet screens which is smaller than the desktop that makes the strokes to get hidden inside the area that was not visible on the tablet however the area is visible in desktop
in fact given that google rejected pointer event on the ground of speed which ie solved by gpu acceleration it can be said that google-chrome and webkit in general - safari is even slower is lagging behind on this front and the only way to help is contributing code to chromium webkit
if your watch doesn t have usb support moto 360 and other induction only charging you need to enable bluetooth debugging slower than through usb though
the fact that the subclassing is more selective only actually writes about what it writes is new functionality especially in light of the fact that the superclass promises nothing
please note that you can use erlang or elixir which is much easier
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way
the children still do not need to know about the parent and the parent gets a more direct event as opposed to a signal connection
and ram access is much more fast than disk access
i ve found some comments and references that seem to indicate that setting the height greater than the width will cause the browser to change the orientation automatically but in my testing that only works in opera used to work in opera but not anymore
post has a higher overhead marginally if we re honest but it all adds up but it doesn t become part of the url so can t be seen by say a casual observer over the user s shoulder - whereas get can
notice that a children choice solution can have more than one parent and that choice can be either an array or one element.
swt community is smaller and it doesn t provide that many tools as swing does
processing rss feed is more comfortable
in terms of performance rtp udp streaming is far better but there is no guarantee that it will get transported through the internet via routers nat boxes proxies etc
if your versioning is older than that it won t work and you ll need to upgrade
but he has some constraints like min must be bigger than max and neither of them should be bigger than 100 or lesser than 0
here s the solution for post variables as well which is probably trickier for more users than the get solution
since i agree using getter setter is better way
you might want look at robocopy as it has many more options than xcopy
that fits better with both pandas and patsy s way of representing things
but as you can see top side is not fixed it is also moving slightly i want to make top side fixed it should not move like hermes website and want to make this wave continuous instead of just once when webpage loads also i noticed once wired thing that when i keep open my modified version in browser for 5-10 minutes it shrinks in size height width and gets too smaller after sometime
so i think before following the convention of getter and setter it is more important to follow the convention of variable naming
there are tonnes of posts blogs on this so just google mongodb working set but as you know access from ram rather paging to disk is quicker
4.c i am working on aix so i only have sh and ksh no bash therefore i cannot use the array tools provided by the latter that s why i thought of awk that and the fact that i think awk is probably stronger though i might be probably
the result is that using d3.js can feel a little lower-level - you have more control but you have to be pretty familiar with svg syntax to do some of the things protovis does much more easily
bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git
you could do something similar using the score values in sorted sets giving children a score just lower than the parent
if the md5 from your select query results in a hash that is larger than the last record in your table you might get no records from the query
i have a problem with my code i already make a code with mouseover but it was very slow to display per row my picture edit so i read that mouseenter is faster i hope because i have normaly 2000 row
i am specifically trying to connect it via usb serial as the device needs to be mounted unattended and bluetooth connection seems less reliable plus extra cost for bluetooth capabilities on the device so potentially more cost effective over usb serial
but for the task you describe you d probably be better off with docx4j with which i m involved or apache-poi - especially if you are trying to do this server-side or in an environment where the client pc environment is unknown
but why when i tested this it s alert max less than min
if we express combinations of states in an nfa as states themselves we ve got a dfa with a lot more states than the nfa but which does the same thing
here is what it would look like with testng it s a little more contrived with junit since you can t pass parameters directly to test functions
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds
when i launch it with firefox or internet explorer the box gets immediately to a huge distance from the margin much bigger than the width of the screen and now i noticed that if i run it with stackoverflow s snippet function the box does not move
give it a try works perfect for me what it is doing query get the all the post with a left jon with comments table so when a post has comment them n it also has the comment_date if no comments posted on the post then in result set it will be null so i have merged the comment_date with post_date so which post has the greater date for comment_date or post_date it will first and so on
in any case raf will enable the drawing to be synced to the monitor so in any case it will be a better choice than setinterval settimeout in cases such as these
depending on how your application is structured this means you may want to have your own base class implementing iresource which creates your custom not found resource for all of its subclassing or better make a wrapper since composition is better than inherited
- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4
i am starting to understand that even though emacs is more powerful than vim vim is at least 10 times easier to use less keystrokes and requires way less modifications
i want to type tex equations in onenote send them to mathtype which converts it to mathml and has a more feature-rich editor and send them back afterwards
guys after spending too much time looking around for an easier way to do this i combine the info from research to do it like this simply using the getimagesize function -if the height is larger than the width echo an image tag with a style having a height of 100 else echo the same image tag but with a style having a width of 100
also this way mvp pattern becomes more testable as you can mock the view with fake object and test your presenter in unit tests
at first i tried a solution using a where i would select every coordinate in range check if they were valid if they were i would call a from them to the center position and count the number of steps if they were higher than my max range i would just remove the coordinate from my list
the get is usually faster because it has no encapsulation sends data via url usually with a 255 character limit as post exists encapsulation by being sent by the body of the http request
using checkbox to check uncheck is better than radio button
it s better than having getter and setter to do the job
but break is no better or worse than goto
what is the true rationale behind all the private and protected stuff when we can just make our life as a programmer easier by using public for everything
if you don t have someone around to help with jqgrid you are better off with datatables
for example in the classic browser share example if the firefox is at 45 i want to be rendered inside the pie distance -40 may be and where the slice is less such as opera at 6 - i want it to be shown outside with a connector
better use keyup event name as in my example because keydown requires one more click for the last symbol to be updated
but consider this it s literally impossible to do any better than interlocked operations for cross-process communication with atomic updates and no locks are held
i understand that the background-color one doesn t require an http request and that the background-image takes more processing
i understand that children cannot have a higher opacity than their parent but is there a possible workaround for this
while neither the declarative nor imperative approach is really better than the other both have their merits
the problem is if i upload a image thats bigger than the spaces delimiter it gets resized
i see that the microcontroller used in commercial devices are much cheaper than the avr or pic
a treemap costs a lot more than a linkedhashmap and adds nothing to your project if you only need to keep original insertion order
while widget logic can help you do much more than hide or show a widget to logged in logged out users
that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it
in the example the getter is still public like the entire property while the setter has a more restricted access here private
that said the date class is much better in php5.3 -- it even has dateadd subtract functions which would also solve your problem much better than strtotime .
if you are looking for the latter then flask is a micro framework that is considerably smaller than django
i m using homebrew as it s newer than macports and i don t know enough to choose between them
multiplying is still somewhat more expensive than add on modern computers and compilers go to some effort to replace them with one or two shifts+add instructions
since i provided a getline example above your read loop can be much better written with fgets as follows
here i started above testing with the aim that c for-loop performance will be better than c# loops but it goes exactly opposite with my understanding and gone with this question and agreed...but when i increase the upper range of for-loop the c performance goes well as compared to c#.
the only problem that as far as i know using drawimage is slower than using putimagedata and it was required in old browser versions like firefox 2 or such
i used it because it is small 6 kb compiled with just the extraction making it far smaller than dotnetzip which is more than 150 kb and is more permissive than sharpziplib
speex is designed for speech and should perform better than wma mp3 or other audio codecs that are designed to handle music if you are just encoding speech which i assume since you are grabbing from the mic
direct3d appears in principal to be easier than direct2d but has poor text font handling in the latest version
but i wonder why is division actually slower than multiplication
so i have a post system and i want the box to get larger as more post come in
i ve read that direct2d is much faster than gdi so i figured i would give it a shot for dealing with constantly updated variables
inherited is more useful when a new subclassing wants to change the way a method works if you just need to change the data the class uses to work probably an approach like this would do the trick
the exact algorithm you choose will depend on a combination of how fast you need it to run and what kinds of shapes you want to support convex are the easiest concave is harder shapes with holes are harder too
is there any option to prevent parent element be overflowed by children element when children element position is absolute and hight of children is higher than parent
a public getter or setter gives you more flexibility - when we try and read the variable might not be ready
the checks for the first and last group smaller than min and greater than max is done with simple if checks which doesn t affect the complexity
q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t
that s why even picky compilers do not issue a warning if you shift a chars wider than 7 bits try it - you ll get the warning only if you shift wider than an int allows
if you are talking about someone else s there is no promise that they will render larger than the screen since would be wise to clip their painting to what is visible and they may be further constrained by other factors such as the size of a directx surface which is smaller than the gdi limit
what i want to do is if you try to select more than 6 checkbox it will automatically disable all the button however if you tap the even one of the checked checkbox it will make all the checkbox checkable
although maybe you should instead find some 32 64bit recent book for your os as the 32b protected mode on x86 is much easier to learn only the graphics output is not as straightforward as it was back in dos era but if you will mix your asm files with c++ loader which would for example initialize some window surface as argb memory array you can pass that pointer down to the asm routines and toy around with pixels in the same simple way how the old 320x200 mode 13h in dos worked
you could try using double which is bigger than a long and use only the int part
this only happens when the min range is zero any other time when the min is greater than zero the query works exactly as expected
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully
note that in this case the isnull would do the same as coalesce but looks better for this application in case you add some new language
by the way if you like minimalistic approach there is also scite editor which is my personal preference for doing small bits of code it s even more lightweight than notepad++
note the bit that says so fewer than cnt packets may be processed - it s up the the pcap implementation what it does
i have read in a site that another benefit of having lighttpd in front of apache is lower number of child processes
standard post request is not more secure than get one
the fact that using getline with iostreams is faster than fgetc at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away
i am wondering if i can submit the paramaters to via ajax show a loader image after submission it but once the file is complete return the file for download
if you need more than just min and max then
you should also adjust your conditionals to check for a low high range as it should quickly get smaller as your median value approaches the real value
since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests
since the next is not far the number of backtracking steps is much fewer than with greedy matching
if you think that writing two apps for both versioning is a better idea then should i write app on wp8 first and at the end remove special wp8 features to downgrade it for wp7.5 or maybe i should write wp7.5 app and then add some wp8 features to upgrade it to wp8
but maven and ant are so different that there is no real point at comparing them and maven is still much more than ant + dependency management
show less will be hide and load more button will be show .thanks
you need two button one for up and one for down or you could use one button and a checkbox for up or down but i think two button is simpler
because it seems you re going to deploy a cluster i think titan is the better choice unless you re willing to pay for the enterprise edition of neo4j to support clustering
when i try to get more than 100 post it returns
i believe what s happening is that odata uses merge verb that is more efficient than put put requires sending all fields while merge sends only changed data but in your model field b is marked as required so you get a validation exception on the client side
if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format
get and head being much more frequent than post
okay safari ios is more strict than google-chrome android when it comes to this all fine but it still needs to enable me to allow the connection through
you d basically need a set of procedures to act as controllers - parsing vars more likely as get post cookie performing any data lookup building + filling the model and then another set of procedures that at as views - taking what s in the model and rendering it for the user
i found another approach using the cairo context passed to the handler of draw events but it resulted in capturing a region of the parent window that was larger than the drawingarea
side note union all is faster than union distinct but based on your requirements you need union distinct which can be written as simply union
so what is with svn that your company dislikes so much and cvs does better
here a number of methods are described to fix the parent which collapses to smaller than its floating children
ecdsa is much faster than rsa for private key operations so it should definitely be preferred over rsa when high efficiency is required unless rsa is still fast enough something that may very well be the case
this is only a guess and is not based on actual performance testing probably wicket will be doing better than vaadin
if you want to check that a number is between the min and max of the range you would likely want to check that it is both higher than the min and lower than the max
i was wondering if someone could explain to me why field access seems to be slower than getter setter method access and also why the last 8 iterations execute incredibly fast
more than 1 parent have children referenced in the database this exception
if i try to add more than 1 ssl binding i get the error at least one other site is using the same https binding and the binding is configured with a different certificate ...
however from time to time i want to set more than just setter and getter
image is an abstract-class so i think the real question is which subclass is more efficient for your program
hey guys can anyone tell me why my code in this jsperf seems to indicate that a for-loop is actually faster than a while loops
words like arbitrary processing and neither not safe make post sounds less secure than put when there is a choice
i read somewhere that adding a different salt to each hash makes it more secure
right now queryover is much more robust in the nhibernate community mainly because it is based on criteria queries which have been around for quite some time
note i do not know much about ninject but i worked with spring.net that is much more complicated
this low level network capturing is not something i am normally akin to i m normally higher up with fiddler or charles but considering this isn t via http i need to go lower down the stack
also remember multiplication is much more expensive than addition
currently i am able to generate checkbox in column what i need is one more column with button same as checkbox in each row
my codebase is front-end only so after doing a little reading i thought bower would make more sense than npm
you can feel like post is more secure than get all you want but it s a false premise
use post instead of get it s more secure
i have a speech bubble class which i m using to show message in a chat box when the user sends it through my chat client.the user enters in the input field but if the user input goes greater than the height or width of the bubble the message gets out of the bubble.i want to expand the bubble size according to the message given by the user
one addition for embedded cpu architecture they have to be usually cheaper than mainstream processors so that they do not raise the product s life considerably
obviously very similar to the virus answer above the difference being that while viruses usually replicate spread do a preprogrammed inconvenient thing a botnet is more of a take control of your machine for a future usually nefarious but dynamic purpose. i think the hosts your agent can more easily change with a botnet too
memcached around 4-5 times slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touched everywhere in my environment
put to the api a message describing the outcome of the game post is acceptable put is better for idempotency
you can indeed execute scripts on almost any page using content scripts that can manipulate the dom allowing you to add an onsubmit event listener to a form more reliable than onclick on a button as it is fired however the form is submitted - hitting enter
however in the comparative table i linked get is listed as less secure than post
openpgp is simpler than x509 but more limited especially if you wish to have a strong legal meaning behind the certificates
i also tried sorted and the necessary casts but min max is faster than that
at the moment both postgresql and greenplum are open source products so you are free to chose any of them but of cause postgresql community is bigger atm
now i m trying to do the same thing with imagemagick to be more correct with magick++
but for someone who doesn t even know what an integer is numbers without fractions values is probably clearer
basically if you know that your events are never larger than a given duration you can search for a bounded range that s larger than the max duration then add restrictions to get rid of the extra stuff that matched
i ve used ferret in the past with few problems although i ve heard sphinx is better
that way the hash salt is more random and your data a bit more secure
the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow
the ram is much faster than the hard disk
so if all you need is to serve images instead of doing additional processing in java the ram disk approach is indeed faster also uses less memory
as i said this may increase the speed especially in an environment where modulo is more expensive than simple subtraction but you would want to actually benchmark it to be certain
and i ll just add to previous comment if 128bit number has prime factor larger than 64bit then it certainly has a factor less than 64bit
the pinoyyd post is neater and get straight to the point how do i authorise a background web app without user intervention
see this blog when you have 10000 request koa performs better than express
memcpy will always be faster than strncpy for any real world situation even in the corner case i spoke before look page_copy_fwd_maybe
the idea of saying break out of the nth nested loop is worse than a goto from a structural perspective
trampolines never runs more than one thunk at a time so if you break
data-size xml very verbose but usually not an issue when using compression and thinking that the write access case through post or put is much more rare as read-access in many cases it is 3 of all traffic
division is per se slower than multiplication however i don t know the details
i searched a bit and found that dill can perform better than pickle with classes but i am having problems to implement it
this code is not perfect though because it doesn t support when height is bigger than width easy to fix thoughâ
any attempt to reuse a single parentedtree as a child of more than one parent or as multiple children of the same parent will cause a valueerror exception to be raised
as far as security goes post is much better than get as the data is sent behind-the-scenes rather than embedded in the url making it the typical protocol for login info
so i asked myself can a double be faster than a int
for something like a search where you are retrieving information it might be okay but for anything that stores information the post redirect get pattern is a better approach
if this works it seems that u are still comparing the strings in your ordered list and u should now check if the return value of compareto is less grater equals to 0
while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and so the underscores look a bit strange as you don t expect them there
how to get more than 20 post from instagram using their api
when i go and change my max as 0.9 the red border should automatically disappear since technically now min is less than max
safari behaves better than firefox but an error message â œone error in opening the pageâ â shows up in the status bar if you remove the iframe during the load event
ram and disk space is more than enough
when such individuals are subject to crossover their children are likely to be worse than either parent
other than the four options provided by the cookbook - return new user username password salt roles - i need about 20 more fields with getter and setter
you can also read up on how to make rvm work with passenger 3 it might be transferrable to 4 with gemsets though in my opinion using bundler deployment is much better option
the invariant here however is that the parent s index must always be lesser than its children
so it is considerably less then what facebook states in their documentation at least looking by the date however by count it seems you get more than 50 post
it worked in this case in my first part with chars i tried to look at my first part which works fine and i noticed that chars is easier to convert to int basically i don t need to convert it but with string it doesn t work this way i tried to google it but i can t find proper solution
one more edit if you want to use getline instead which you asked about in the comments - and it s even safer than fgets since it will increase the buffer size as needed you would change to change the code a little bit
while this is fine in some cases where flexibility is needed reading a line at a time with getline of fgets is the better choice
i can do this in bokeh but i have other issues regarding interactivity which plotly manages better
if you have a team which feels more comfortable with setter getter why not
i have links of term on sidebar when i attach more than one post to term it get repeat
as mentioned above as you remove items the arrays gets smaller so a for-loop is probably not the best solution
in my opinion using jquery show hide is a better solution at this point in time
you can get soap services to work on iphone but it s a lot more work than just get or post ing against an url
unfortunately this doesn t work as children can t have more than one parent
if any of the children also has -webkit-filter npx the filter gets applied twice once for child and once for parent
from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option
post is no more secure than get over the http protocol
then children have one more depth than their parent and children s path starts with the parent path
it is said that get method is faster than post but i don t know why is it
so while the writes my be sequential on disk for datasets larger than ram these random reads will quickly become the bottle neck
i want to use accelerometer but i learnt that gyroscope is better option to calculate the accelerometer
for eps is the same situation the post script is more readable but you should apply all necessery transformations on object before get its size
and my guess as to why an element is being dropped is your compareto method never returns a 1 in any case so elements are always considered to be less than or equals to other elements which is probably screwing with the treeset
you may also want to have a look at dill which covers slightly more cases than pickle
i am trying to make a dialog pop-up that displays more information about an entry in a listview
in the cases where auto can be used it is more concise than decltype as you don t need to provide the expression from which the type will be inferred
it works like range so i need to pass it a number one greater than the max number in the current index
here s another article that describes the listview control and why it s probably a better fit than the gridview
check if any of the children are greater than the parent node
double is better than int though as it will help you keep precision
i know it is much easier by using ggplot2 but i need to get it done by lattice
i use all the events for the drag operation so maybe the initial move is less laggy perceptually in this case
first of all if it was not for the relative complexity of the expressions here scipy would have been definitely the better option over sympy
modules such as dill are doing a better job than pickle
that way each thread can pick up a link when it s ready which makes more sense than partitioning in advance
making abstract-class before i had more than one subclass in mind for them
then we found glibc also have same issue but increase rate is less than tcmalloc
i find the best way is to create a cache session folder in your systems directory is more safer i put important things like logs and cache in system rather than application folder
you insert in there but never select from there as far as i know today myisam is better than innodb in this case
in the hopes that this will further my goal of squashing out the stupid for loops are inherently slow canard for r here is a re-working of your first version still using a for-loop that is more than 40x times faster
i probably feel fseek might be bit faster than fread as fseek changes the pointer position to the new address space that you have mentioned and there is no date read is happening
doing something similar with sorting and filtering however is more tricky because i do both of those at the sql level
if your working set is larger than your ram the operating system will be constantly swapping pages out to disk to make room to swap in pages that an application wants to access
on mac os x dwarfdump shows this relationship with indentation - children dies are indented a little more than parent dies
this can enable the user to download an upgrade patch that is much smaller than the installation package for the entire product
if you want to exlude a number 4 that means the range is smaller by 1 so use r.nextint 5 and if the result is the excluded number then return the max allowed which is 5 because it will never be generated because you used max - 1
i believe that the reports are using something more along the lines of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that
i know different engines render fonts differently and but the issue i m having is that firefox renders the font higher than google-chrome - at the size i am displaying the font this is very noticeable 3 or 4 px - which on a button means they re totally misaligned
i would advice to check if the width is bigger than the height of the picture taken landscape picture and if that is the case show an alert to the users to explain that just portrait pictures are supported
at some point if you re doing randomish queries and your working set is sufficiently larger than ram then you ll be limited by the small number of random iops a disk can do
this is happening because i am trying to separate out the search terms based on spaces since spaces comes more natural to users then comma separation or pipes or any other delimiter
i have found though that since i started using the asset_sync gem which uses fog instead of aws-s3 gem i don t have any more trouble with paperclip and s3
one way that you can consider for hide information not totally but more stronger than get of user is create a json with your infos and send a post request to your page
but then your setter is less restricted than your getter which is odd.
i believe post is better than get
when it comes to deletion it even gets worse when saving at the end of all entity removals dbcontext is around 18 times slower than objectcontext
reading audio files from ram is much faster than reading audio files from hard disk
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around
in the long run you ll have less troubles with supporting tablet multiple screens sizes and you can easily re-use them in different contexts
i believe it is significantly simpler than opencv which on a raspberry pi for example takes around 1gb of space and over an hour to build whereas cimg is a single header-only file that you include in your code with no libraries needing to be installed which can do what you ask
indeed you ll handle php object with getter setter which is better in my point of view
sorting is more important to me than filtering so if i have to have both sorting and filtering target the same representation of the data i ll just give up on filtering working
this is because division operator has higher preference than the subtraction operator - in the first example you use are not using brackets therefore division takes place first you can change your code to
as painful as it s going to be for both of us to perform the upgrade it s probably better to commit the time now and get the code up to the latest versioning than to try to find an older versioning that reduces the effort
note that rf takes more than two spaces as delimiter see but one spaces is not enough
from my experience of both i would suggest that velocity is a little bit simpler but freemarker is more powerful
in addition for doing powers of two bitshifting is usually a little clearer than doing exponent though choose whatever works for you
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point
when one of the strings is a prefix of another the performance of compareto is worse as it still needs to determine the lexicographical ordering while equals won t worry any more and return false immediately
what i want is to get all post which contains 20 less in the title
when you extends you incorporate the code of the superclass into yours sometimes there is no code to incorporate so implements is better suited
it depends on your requirements but setting up a usb connection is sometimes easier than managing a bluetooth connection
if you are not notifying or doing anything else then the automatic getter setter method is the quicker to develop that is not claiming it is the fastest or slowest to execute though
but if convenience is more important than efficiency yes you probably should consider a tree model not dom necessarily xom is better for example or data binding jaxb or xstream
quite apart from the fact that the language vb.net is far more feature rich than vb6 the fact that you have developed in vb.net means that you have made extensive use of the .net class libraries including system.security.cryptography that you give as an example
no objects come magically into existence in swift any more than in objective-c
ok if we say that the parent is always bigger than the children because it is above them we write
post is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs. also data is not displayed in the url
that is because that style of loops is a better fit for what you are doing than the for-loop you used earlier
i ll just add that if the 128bit number is prime or has a prime factor larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem
i don t see any form properties in the code you posted so either the posted code has been modified or the properties is higher in the inherited tree simpleformcontroller
i try to fit a gam using the gam package i know mgcv is more flexible but i need to use gam here
in either case mongoose is going to add a tiny amount of overhead so it s likely to be technically slower than mongojs but not by any meaningful amount like it takes 5.1 seconds to insert 20k records vs 5.0 seconds
the perf hit will be ridiculous i know apple say swift execute faster than objective-c but this is low level so it will be harmless
since you don t want to repeat yourself it s very tempting to put all your validation on one side or the other but there are tradeoffs either way and it is true that server-side validation is going to be slower than client-side
i would like it to be more real time than post get so would like to use socket.io or failing that web sockets or failing that real sockets
how can i connect a method and not a command with a binding from the viewmodel to an attached event to ask in a more general way with caliburn micro
if your upgrade or installation is taking longer increase the value
i start off with something like mysql and then later on i might decide that postgresql makes a better fit - and if i have done everything the propel way switching to the new engine is trivial - rebuild and go
also a post request would be better than a get if you re sending json
i try to make shooter game on c# with sfml.net but i can t imagine how to make an ability to shoot more than 1 bullet because now i have just one null-object of bullet-class and when player presses space key this object gets link to the new bullet
interestingly enough sincos seems to be even slightly faster than sin without cos and the gcc compiler will use fsincos when you compute both sin and cos - so it does what i d like hotspot to do or does hotspot too
you can avoid duplicates and still run much faster than union distinct which is actually same as union by running query like this
this also happens on smaller devices between portrait and landscape modes which is really my concern
however i feel like angular ionic provides a better way of doing so that i missed
if you re looking for small implementations you might get better results with bottle or flask
but i don t want to use a for-loop as my json arrays has more than 3 entries and if i request a lot of data in short time it takes long time till the for-loop goes through every entry
then when you are creating each element of the array also check whether it is less than the min or more than the max
edit2 seems as if i m wrong re post being more secure than get
if you can t afford lost packets then tcp is probably a better option than udp since it provides that guarantee out of the box
however note that post is not much safer than get
i wonder why everybody missed that multiplication is much faster than division
for example i d like to serve an http error code if the user tries to do more than x get post per minute but i d still like to enable that same user to burst up to y where y x until he hits the burst cap
disclaimer i am more familiar with haskell than ocaml so i may not be doing things in the most idiomatic way
in this situation storing password hash and the salt is more secure than storing the credentials encrypted or not because an attacker would have no way of getting the password back even if he manages to get his hands on both the hash and the salt
from what i have read on here i here that nunit is more popular over mbunit
in addition x86 is furhter complicated because there are generally separate documentation manuals for 32 bit and 64bit processors i m not familiar enough with arm to comment here
this solution is cleaner than implementing comparable by your dto because you can create and use many comparator acording to your needs
there s not really a graceful way to break out of for l although it is much faster than a goto loop
note most recently i have been using bazaar and hg with fully powerful regexps so may be looking for stuff more powerful than git provides
now this obviously doesn t work because the new bounds don t have to be strictly less greater than the min max
my assumption in the question above is that disk is as fast as ram or faster than ram
however consider that pypy might do the linear search 100 times faster than cpython then a few times might be dozens
i need to create a menu based on that list but cannot simply list all post and get it because it is a busy blog and has more than 2000 post
you can avoid duplicates using union all and still run much faster than union distinct which is actually same as union by running a query like this
again this is perhaps more clear than using raw sql and only requires one query but this one query could be very large it will return all items and their categories and doing the grouping filtering yourself is probably less efficient than letting the database do it for you
we can also do more than show hide
a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial
variety of supporting widgets is probably the single area in which archetypes is still stronger than dexterity
i also use objective-c more than swift but here s what my guess is as to what the objective-c code would come to
using post allows for more data to be transferred since get will append the values to the url itself
this method is more general than show hide as it can be extended to any style rule
i think you are confusing deprecated which means the api method calls are marked to not be deleted in the future and should not be used which being replaced by newer features as in gridview and listview
this will work directly with avassetexportsession which is much easier than playing with avassetwriter unless you have a very specific requirement typically you need to manipulate the actual video frames
yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructors
from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes
thats really simple try to set i max an then count i down with the condition that i must be greater than min
also note that they are much slower than proper getter and setter
generally i ve read many time you should do ajax calls as get requests not post because post produces more overhead and traffic
because in this case both the parent element and children elements are belonging to a same stacking context #root in your demo and negative z-index order let children stay lower than parent in the z axis
presumably you know that it is precisely that no node has more than one parent or more than two children
consider that position relative will preserve this z-index for its children so if the topmost parent is lower than another element competing for the same level it will be placed beneath even if a child claims to have a z-index greater than another element outside of the element chain
from what i ve noticed lately using case with aggregates min or max performs better than pivot although not as pretty
this can help you to calculate if it will be wider than the width of the page and you can find out how many lines the string will have to take and how often you have to subtract the line height from the y value bottom of page
on the other hand swift is easier to learn especially if you have objective-c background so it can be adopted during the time slowly and paralelly with using objective-c
post would spring to mind but i think get is a more appropriate method because 99 of the time you only supply a bunch of parameters to these types of actions
i read in some blog that orientdb performs at least as good if not better than neo4j while also offering more complex types like mongodb would
in this case i converted the cvs to svn and found the file size on the hard drive it was on my own laptop at the time but it was much smaller in svn than in cvs but there could have been some compression applied i dont know but everything on the web said svn would actually be bigger than cvs
the following code is working without any error but my problem is when i create a thumbnail some times thumbnail are non understandable one some conditions such as width is very larger than height i also tried a code for calculate height automatically.but it won t perfectly works
cloudpickle might be a good idea for your problem as well it has better support in pickling objects than pickle not per see better than dill and you can pickle code easily as well
you linked to a question about a war vs a jar while spring boot s jar is indeed a jar it contains more than what you usually put inside a jar
as long as each parent is smaller than its children - it will work
according to my experience yii is easy to use but it has some pros and cons too every framework has but i used laravel on some projects and i think laravel is much more better than yii
note also that in general it is best to follow the pattern of reloading pages with get after post which makes you less susceptible to form resubmitions in which case using sessions for storage is the better solution
the questions should i use for-loop or is it better to do it recursively next insert will be called after previous is done should i check if saved.length datalength and then return the arrays or is there some better way how to do it
if we try to uninstaller or repair it it would show the install welcome screen and if we go further it would end up with our install condition failures because required prerequisites software is no more there
i know this question is a bit older but in es2015 there is a new data structure called map that is much more similar to a dictionary that you would use in c#
just copy the content of your code in doget to dopost it should work or else set form method get but in case of password validation post is better and write your code for validation in dopost
you want to make sure the code will work when users upgrade more than 1 versioning and that the update statement only runs the one upgrade it is needed
post gives you more options and dosn t have a limit on parameter query string length like get the only negative is post is slower by a couple of milliseconds to create the request
you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique salt is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the hash over username
for example if you want to implement an equivalent of std map it would be a pain to do it with a red-black tree but a skip-lists is much more manageable
the situation is critical if on some platform libtiff provides a narrower functionality and does not link to libjpeg which will not be available on that platform at all so the above command for linking will fail due to unsatisfied library dependency
as an added answer there is also the aggregate-functions which is more general than sum
characters post is more robust and secure than get
also note that for form submission it is typically better to use the onsubmit event as opposed to the onclick event since forms can technically be submitted by hitting the enter key as well as clicking the submit button
as accuracy goes i ve noticed that for directions here in north carolina mapquest is slightly more accurate
so my question is how do i determine what the last modified file is from more than one directory actually need it for four different folder
even if all the traffic resides on the same network the client traffic will have been throttled by your wan capacity which is always less than your lan capacity
for batch puts it s better if you construct a list of puts and then call because it uses a single rpc call to commit the batch but depending on the size of the list write buffer may fflush it all or not
i know that probably issuing dotnetfx45_full_setup.exe q will have no bad effect if installing on a system that already has versioning 4.5 but i still would like to not install the upgrade if the upgrade already exists faster and less problems
now i want to show an error message when the image isn t a png jpg or gif or is larger than 250k
if too much memory is consumed it might swap to disk which is slower than ram
mayavi has more options for moving the camera than matplotlib but it doesn t seem to have a way to rotate around the y axis so i m guessing i ll need to perform some complex calculations on the azimuth and elevation to achieve the same result - but i m at a loss as to where to start i m new to working in 3d space and my brain doesn t think that way yet
get is slightly faster because the values are sent in the header unlike the post the values are sent in the request body in the format that the content type specifies
i resolved the problem the point is that a pkcs#12 file as a pfx contains more then 1 certificate so it must be loaded in this way
i know that when it does the whole configuration settings are representing a much smaller screens than the tablet s screens but how can i tell if this is a regular phone device with a small screens or a tablet running compatibility zoom mode
you d be better off with memcpy which is probably close to what your compiler gives you for free if you just write the class the normal naive way with no std array and no pointer gymnastics
speed isn t important here but in other applications it is good to know that regexes are very fast 100 times faster than lxml and 1000 faster than beautifulsoup
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested
as far as when awt may be more useful than swing -
the issue is that the phone screens height in landscape mode is likely much less than a tablet or pc
once you have chosen a root node it is already easy to construct a bst taking into consideration the fact that left children are less than the parent node and all right children are greater than the parent node
if noop a put may make more sense than a post which would imply creating a second connection
note that this will pick any number that is at least min but less than max
the question i have is i would like the calendar to only display the min and max date range for the from date and to date any thing greater than the max and anything less than the min should be greyed out
nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk
i have a objective-c application working fine and smooth to be more comfortable with swift i decided to write the unit tests for this app in swift
no hate against gson but in my experience jackson has been more featureful and the lead dev is very good about addressing bugs feature requests
i did some research and found that udp may be more suitable in this case because udp hole punching works much better than tcp hole punching
if you care about your user s passwords at all use something more complicated than md5 and ideally you should have a salt string of some form
you can use treemap instead of linkedhashmap because you dont want to retain the order of insertion and for sorting treemap is better choice
as you can see the bottom two photos landscape so have been rotated are narrower than the portrait ones at the top
i know that there s another way to check if a double number is bigger than maximum int value but i m curious as why it s happening this way
this is a lot more pom.xml code but i like it better than the maven-shade-plugin because it does just what i want and nothing more
quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson
i m making a responsive site and i m needing my images to be no more than 100 width of their containing elements but also no more than a certain percentage height in case they fall off the page
you probably don t want to go back to anything earlier than delphi 3 but some pascal programming books can be helpful
or if you re really focused on only doing opengl i may suggest using glfw which is the better glut but you ll have to draw the menus yourself using opengl
you ll want to have multiple radio button each with it s own value to set some property to although this is weird for a yes no you are better off with a checkbox but if you had multiple values this is how radio button work
if i m not mistaken when capistrano makes the current folder it is actually a shortcut for lack of a better term to the most recent release perhaps symlinked directory is better
the swift compiler is doing a lot more and is quite a bit newer than the objective-c compiler so it unlikely it will be as stable fast for quite some time
as one good programmer can be more productive than two average programmers i vaguely remember an old ibm study concluding someone in the top percentile was 27x more productive than median it s useful to see the same programmers doing it both ways
since the filesystems is more than likely fat or fat32 protecting it permission based way would be more convoluted
notice how max is smaller than min due the nature of your formula
on the other hand the secure tunnel created in a vpn is far more secure than remote desktop
the where clause basically includes only the parent who have less than 4 children or who do not have any children at all b.employee_id is null
get is better for some cases but it seems to me you should use post instead
swing is better and few people remember how to use awt components
if a parent has more than 2 children
the above works deleting .bak files older than 7 days in those folder my question is how can i reverse that and delete .bak files in every other directory that s older than 3 days without deleting the ones kept from the first query
unicorn does not use less memory than passenger
so your for-loop will complete before any of the timeouts run and before any of the ajax success callbacks run and all of the timeouts are scheduled to run 2000 milliseconds after loops finishes more or less at the same time
for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it
microchip is more successful in industry and has better tools than avr
even if there are no inherited enumerable properties it is still more work to do than not
i feel like the getter setter example is more clear and hides the implementation details of what name and description are
it seems mysql is more forgiving with this than postgresql but in every case you use a reserved word you should escape it
keep in mind that using setinterval is less efficient for this case then using settimeout which doesn t require comparing times at all as it schedules the alarm to occur at a particular time as setinterval will use more processor cycles to both schedule a check and then to compare the times
that would mean i d need to do a post rather than a get though get makes more sense when i m just getting some static data right
at the time this was faster because addition was a lot faster than multiplication but that s no longer the case
another reason to choose nvidia is because that s what the hpc system builders have been building systems with since nvidia made a huge push for gpgpu computing where as it s less backed by amd ati
if you absolutely must connect to a database hosted on the cellular network end i would suggest you try setting up a vpn openvpn is a good product available on many platforms or using a reverse tunnel it s simpler but you will need to setup the reverse tunnel everytime you want to access remote database
for example if you had a class in which it would make sense to do addition before multiplication how could you make the addition operator have higher precedence than the multiplication one
you could manage more than get or post like put delete...
also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long
so turning a non-vr game into a vr game that doesn t make you sick will unfortunately take more than mouse keyboard emulation
i admit javascript isn t my strong point and have a much easier time with objective-c and swift
into swing application i like to avoid using it with swt but is its more easier its ok
opted to use arduino from command line because it suited my needs so far i know avrdude and avr-gcc is a more complete or better way to compile upload from command line correct me if i m wrong
if a listview or gridview is a better approach i am open to that as well
i haven t worked with awt much but swing is much better from the gui developer s point of view
i ve found that bootcamp was slightly faster than vmware non bootcamp image but i still use vmware the majority of the time because i like using the host os for things like mail chat browsing
or whatever you branched from so the resulting history will appear i started from later version and the merge back will probably be fast-forward it s easier to work with especially since you are rewriting the actual history to logical changesets anyway
in the previous example break is better than goto
just remember in a nested set all children s left values are greater than and right values are less than the parent
however you cannot do anything more than get the content -- you cannot add headers cannot use post
min is always lesser than guess and max is always greater than guess
the wording in your question seems to suggest you don t care as much that the output is mips but rather you want the output to be less complex than x86
all of racket s languages can interoperate so your language of choice is up to you though the rnrs languages tend to go unused in the racket community #lang racket is much more useful for writing programs than any of the scheme implementations but they can be useful if you want to write programs that run on different scheme implementations
other than that accepting a get request might be - depending on the server side rest framework - slightly more light weight than post requests
edit taking into account what was said in the comments though it looks more secure and is recommended by w3 see touheed khan s answer post isn t more secure than get and as riggsfolly said
if the hot data won t fit in ram on either machine then disk i o performance becomes more important than ram mostly random read i o and the fsync flush rate
i need to make sure that each of these top mail directory sa44-3 is not larger then 8gb so the script should calculate the size of each top level folder and if its over 8gb create a new one called eg
if you want to get more out of infowindow and put html content in them i would recommend trying infobox
sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings
however post is a bit more safe than get because get could be stored in the history
all-in all the reason is that nsmutablestring is able to do more things than nsstring and can do anything nsstring can hence the direction of inheritance
are the nodes in order like in your example where the children have a larger id than the parent
i would suggest you start with scheme and more specifically with racket formerly plt scheme
yes adding more code than getter and setter is fine in your domain objects
tip when i place parent blue here higher vertically than children orange here and i notice the bird body with raised wings pattern of a parent on either side then i recognize a many-to-many relationship exists between the parent
you may also try to signal the same page about a valid log-in by sending some information to the same page using the post or get methods post is more secure but i don t recommend it for this purpose at all
then for class i ve used the addclass and removeclass is better then change it attributes
as last resort resolution i don t suggest this for security issues using ssl is always safer switch your registry to use http instead of https
but works fine if more than 6 checkbox are selected then reduced to 6 with more than one button click
if everything is correct why keras perform so much better than lasagne
memory is thousands of times faster than disk so if something gets read often having it in ram is drastically faster
...then using the animate on click event you could give the height a value and animation time the width a delay equal o bigger than the height animation time and then it s value...that should do the trick but it s more stiff than actually using the ui
if you need to do anything more complex than put file or get file take a look at edtftpj free
this is better than using a second view a bit larger as a calayer is lighter than a uiview and you don t have do modify the frame of myview which is good for instance if myview is a uiimageview
i rather prefer grep since it s much faster than comm and also does not require the input to be sorted
i ve seen similar questions asked here before but the answers all seemed to assume that the container s width would be greater than its height - something that is not guaranteed in my scenario
you can t get more than 20 post if you are a sandbox user
if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get it done in junit
new h i is guaranteed to be the smallest of the old h i s children which is still larger than old h i s parent
locking unlocking in the getter setter is much safer you cannot forget to do it and more convenient the lock does not have to be directly accessable everywhere you use the property than an external lock on every property access
on a tablet i don t have this issue because the screens size is bigger and i make videoview always on screens
code upgrade require system downtime and if you have a large cluster that cannot run more than one versioning of code at once you ll need to take the entire cluster down at once
they re much bigger than the uiview of which they are subviews
2 executemany is better than execute as it makes for you the prepare statement
if you have the ajax use get rather than post this is simpler then you can test the response by just viewing the page with the appropriate query string
stemming gives better performance than fuzzy search because it is done when indexing and the actual search can be performed as exact match
the waf benchmark has less of a pronounced difference in performance and i d guess that the answer would be more complicated some factors pypy does better some factors cpython does better and overall cpython comes out slightly ahead
as such creating a radio button rather than checkbox is a better solution
in portrait the spacing is decent but in landscape mode i feel like the graphs should be bigger and take up more space than in portrait mode which is simply not possible with the tab bar and navigation bar
i guess one of them is that the push model is less coupled then the pull model
this would be simple to implement but the problem is that if i would just draw individual vertical lines there is the possibility to have gaps in the signal namely if the previous min is higher than the next max or the next max is lower than the previous min
for me they serve pretty same purpose to hide complexity except accordion is imho better for continuous-reading it s easier to quickly go to next section while tabs seems to be more random-access
i m not too eager for using swt though since i m more familiar with swing
works because ceil a b is always one greater than floor a b except when a b is a whole number
sure that s probably compiled or jit d away but you should avoid division in performance critical code it s far slower than multiplying
after several tests i found out that my heapsort is way quicker than quicksort i think it should be the other way around my selection sort is also faster than insertion sort
going to go ahead and say that gson is a lot more user friendly albeit less powerful than jackson
also we see hadoop s sqoop is much faster than spark for this part but it writes to hdfs which will needs a lot of work to be converted to dataset for spark uses
as you can see just doing the multiplication is many many times slower than add or subtract
can someone please help to how use that script using the pypy as i heard it is much faster than cpython
the usual wait time of the post is not too long not too larger than get so i don t think that should be an issue and post always gets back with a 200
of course there are many things that make life easier with getter and setter pattern like hibernate that creates proxies on entities
however when it comes to error reporting on failed cron jobs that takes some more advanced know-how in the nix space which maybe you aren t interested in tackling at this time
for example the validation i am looking for is when a min value is larger then a max value there needs to be an error but this error can be corrected from either textbox and the error for the textbox needs to be removed when this happens
granted fat is an easier problem but they claim to support many filesystems and it would be my first choice
i am working on a responsive sidebar that appears when the button to make it appear is clicked on it uses the transition effect and does not make the page take up more than 100 width or height of the page
also you can determine if someone is submitting a form or getting the form by checking if _server request_method post which is cleaner than using a get url parameter though i guess there s nothing wrong with the other approach...
however the number of people using these giant tablet is much smaller than the number of people with small screens laptops
all this will be much easier with yeoman 1.0 which will be more customizable and will let you use whatever gruntjs tasks you want
in my code every condition is satisfying but the last rule means max price will be always greater than min price is not working
on price and support alone then nexus pro makes sense until you get to 67 users at which point artifactory becomes the cheaper option
btw - i went back and did the upgrade again with bigger jumps between versioning actually ran the site after each upgrade and it went perfectly
how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc
if they are going to use any non-maven way to retrieve them ui rest scripts ant gradle then you can go with any path and name you like and you ll get full support from artifactory uploading searching etc. with nexus which is much more maven-centric you ll better stick to maven notation
watch out you can t query a superclass if you have more than 1 subclassing then something like in jql
if the worker processes do other things than just calulations read from or write to disk they will have to wait a lot since a disk is a lot slower than ram
if i create the same cclabelttf once then i can t add it to more than one ccmenuitem because it will give runtime error about label already added
i m trying to get deeper with post and pre incrementors but am a bit stuck with the following expression
how would i go about creating a formula by which to traverse a data tree stored as a one dimensional array in which the root has k children and where each child has one less child than the parent
from the wildfly console i understand that the undertow subsystem is receiving more or less 20 requests per second and using the application in chrome i see the requests pending for more than 30 seconds
i will say that nginx tends to handle heavier loads better than apache though so take a look at that
you could argue that the struts style is simpler and you can do it in wicket too it just isn t optimal but keeping the state only in the server has many advantages
i am aware that postgresql interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than mysql and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject
gecko is often considered to consume less memory than webkit but this depends a lot on how the browser is implemented
important note placing these calls in viewwillappear and viewwilldisappear instead of viewdidload makes this easier to handle as it will work reliably even for multiple pushes and pops of the same view controller and you won t have to clean up after it in the previous view controller
nobody uses awt anymore because swing is much better
you use pickle might fail dill is more stable
my solution was to use a php variable and increment it on each generated then if i have let s say 13 rows it echoes but the cells must have an exact width so it may add a new line of text if i have a longer text on a cell and the table will have more than 1280px height
while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2
if you are running that versioning or higher or after you upgrade follow these steps
get is more often used on unsecure type of datatransactions like for example a searchform and post is used when you want to make more secure things like a login form
lan is more or less stable wan can be with network issues like
personally i would extract it to a separate class just so that i could in isolation verify that given a width larger than a height i was returned a scalr.mode.fit_to_width and vice-versa
google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum
first don t use wav as it takes up too much memory mp3 is better
looks like either the segment exists and it s smaller than what you asked for or you re trying to create a new one but it s smaller than the system min size shmmin or greater than max shmmax
my personal experience is that webrick is faster in my development environment than unicorn and thin os x in a pretty big rails app lots of gems routes etc
it s hard to explain but just imagine that i move this layout to 300px x then on the phone it works because the screens isn t that large but on tablet it will probably not work because the screens is larger
i suppose that once we start adding elements from h2 as children to elements of h2 then we will have to start checking whether that child is less than the parent and if not we swap them
iostream is said to be slower than cstdio but i suggest you use a profiling tool here to find the best set of options here
for this to work the getter setter approach is a better fit
both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url
using the same code for serializable and deserialization is even more of a pain i cannot off hand figure out how
is get method is better than post method if you use a form
assuming you are trying to create a 32 bit int out of 4 chars there is probably more checking you can do but at a minimum i would turn this into two methods convertchararraytouint and another one that does each shift shiftcharleft chars numbits and hide all the casting ugliness in there
i have this doubt i have a menu in which i run a javascript code or another depending on whether its width is greater or less than its height works me well the first time the screen resolution is detected but if there is a change of resolution or a change of orientation does not detect it and despite for example of having changed to portrait orientation still executing the landscape orientation code
btw if this hyperlink is not in a databound control like listview or gridview it is far better to set the property from the code behind
while you don t get the whole post you do still have to query the database for the id of post with mood grumpy so unless you have lots of post it s probably easier to just go with the answer dorel gave
put is designed for file uploads moreso than post which requires doing a multipart upload but then it comes down to what your server can do as to which is more convenient for you to implement
if that won t help use a small script to add a class to a parent if its children is more than 4
although this thread is more than a year old it still merits from the fact that no one mentioned about the not so recent innovations of nginx lighty and other web servers which scale much better than apache at higher concurrency and consume lesser resources
if you have long-running requests i think the performance will be pretty bad because apache use one thread per connection nginx performs much better
i m currently using carthage as a dependency manager and i know cocoapods is more popular and maybe swift package manager will be something in the near future - so i d like to be able to publish the extensions so people using any of these package managers can easily add them to their projects
union all is better than union because it avoids a sort you know you ll get a distinct set because you re joining on two different tables
directx is in general much faster than gdi due to the fact that it has full acceleration on most video cards
in this case the latter is likely to cause trouble because the insertion of a name hits a random node in the tree i.e the name insertion doesn t follow a pattern and your ram is smaller than the index chances are high that the destination must be fetched from disk
my initial idea was to use radio button for the options because of its exclusion functionality but maybe using checkbox provides a better solution
i don t recommend sending such parameters via url get it is better and safer if you use post form method
if you get a difference between swift and objective-c it s more because swift is probably better on optimisation
since you re using android and retrofit i suggest using okhttp wich is better supported by retrofit and android thread safe the way to this is the following
if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate
it s interesting that this works since the documentation states that max must be larger than min but it looks like -1 is treated more like an empty or null value
setinterval is more useful than settimeout here as it recurs automatically and you don t need to keep setting it
well actually you would be better off with checkbox control and you can make it look just like regular button
should i change my project to trie or is there any other good reasons where avl tree woud be more efficient than trie in case of phonebook
onkeydown although it wouldn t work for pasted data where onchange is probably better
note if more than one show hide on page assign different ids to divs
update having does not work with between because it already selects a result set with a range where the max is less than the result of count
i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get
as powelljf3 said post is more secure then get though it can still be gotten to
the problem is that when i move to an android device whose orientation is landscape by default the device s hardware is arranged in such a way that it is clear it is intended to be used mainly in landscape orientation the x and y coordinates are reversed and the fact that the window s height is greater than its width can t be used to determine whether the user is holding the device with it s top up and its bottom down
what i did not expect is that outputstream is much less bytes than inputstream although i have yet to make any modification on doc
i used get because is faster than post if you need it just to get a list of element for suggestions
this really surprised me because i expected mri to be slower than jruby
hello to all i am developing an application that needs to send a image via the udp socket.i know that tcp is a better protocol but playing with kryonet in java i have learnt that udp is better for this type of application.i have this small class that i have made
you will also notice that the fonts are not scaling as the 7 tablet simply has more screens space available vs the 4 phone
post makes it more indirect to intercept and read the payload than get but not safer
if you don t need anything like that you may use swing or swt it s more of a matter of taste
if you tell it the top of the stack has a double and double is bigger than int you ve now just told it to take extra bytes off of the stack which is terrible
please note that if you don t fix umask and create more than one directory with os.makedirs method you will have to identify created folder and apply os.chmod on them
what you need to use is an xhr or ajax request to get the next 10 post it is much better to do it this way rather than hiding them and activating them as needed because even if you hide it the browser still had to download the content
however if you have a current production mysql versioning that is earlier than v5.7.7 then the removal of this restriction on views should only be one of the criteria being assessed while making a decision as to upgrade or not
since this structure is not exactly related to game logic and technically it can then be reused by implementing an interface for the callback so that you can use this keyboard elsewhere where you want to have your player to type letters using mouse it s better be separated from main logic
the best reason i know of for not destroying dependents is that more than one parent model has_one or has_many children
ansible unlike chef and puppet uses agent less run
again we see the pattern of it getting faster during the first two runs after which it settles somewhere in between slightly faster than yarv and the other jruby and slightly slower than rubinius
ejml looks really good it works almost 2x faster than jama on my data.
if a node has two children then the left child has a smaller value than the parent and the right child has a bigger value
there is a more detailed comparrison between intern and protractor in this blog post here
but the random number is always lower than the min number isn t inside the range i don t know why.
and if you just want something faster or more scalable than svn then just buy a commercial product - i ve used both perforce and rational clearcase and they scale up to huge projects without any problems
casting to int should be fine so long as it s within the appropriate range - but be aware that a double can t represent all 64 bit int exactly so you may also end up with errors when you go beyond the point at which the accuracy of double is such that the difference between two consecutive double is greater than 1
the first difference is that division is much more expensive than addition
also see why aes is more secure than des
so if it takes 1 second to generate each hash it becomes a bigger time sink than it would have been had you used a fast hash such as md5 of a version of sha
i ve read that timsort is better than quicksort both in the best and the worst case although it uses a bit more memory
that is enable to your program to use more at least than one thread more than one processors if necessary that is by definition capped at 1 single virtual core of full use thus 100 of cpu that you see on top on linux or equivalent in other system
i don t think you can do much better than 3 union maybe the last 2 can be combined with count distinct
you might want to try emacs - it has an inbuilt tutorial and some people like me find it easier over vim no flames pls
in terms of interacting with javascript youtube is miles ahead of vimeo and performs much more reliably
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do
you are right that using tcp is probably better to use for something like this or even an existing protocol like tftp
this works perfectly fine but our company has more than 1000 grouping that would be imported if i don t set a filtering for grouping
on your platform a int is bigger than a chars so you are walking off the end of the array and undefined read really bad things are allowed to happen when you do that
bear in mind that if the double returned is larger or smaller than that which can be held in an int then the program behaviour is undefined
that it would perform quicker with get put calls
you can also do it manually with put and get which is more c-ish
which is basically the same thing as the factories then depend on sub-factories but at least they are lighter than presenter views services and they don t need to load the sub-factories until they are needed
this is easier done by filtering for a single date but because you said that companies might cease to exist at a given year i grouping data by month first
i agree with the other answer that it shouldn t be in viewdidload - you ve got no guarantee the view has been added to your window at that point viewdidappear is a better place
i understand that get requests are meant to read data while post requests are meant to alter data if a post request is sent more than once dicey things can happen
however i m not sure you want pass parameters via get if you have a form and url isn t callable from outside of your application post is far better
i encounter the same issue and notice the crash happens if the original shared element is no longer visible on the previous screen when you go back probably it is the last element on screen in portrait but once switched to landscape it s no longer visible and thus the transition has nowhere to put back the shared element
this relates to another question i asked a while back at size of qt containers is qmap much larger than qlist
i am developing application which requires many more than 80 screens layouts each layout having different image views buttons textviews and so on and i have to be able to switching between them upon button clicks
not able to get more than 100 post in single rest api call for the linkedin company updates
and apart from common misleading information where post is safer than get it is not
then you might switch to except all similar to union all which might be more efficient than union because it avoids the distinct operation
we know that chars will have a higher address than the int because once again the standard says so
django is very batteries included meaning that it comes with much more out-of-the-box than say flask and to me a large part of that the user auth system
post is absolutely not more secure than get as to man in middle attacks
if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something udp based could be better than tcp but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones
with careful optimization however you can make addition 61 times faster than division
you can check whether the new number is smaller than min or bigger than max and change them if needed
i ve used it without any guilty feelings and can see no reason why it is worse than using malloc memcpy
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page
on one hand slick2d is fast and simple but it seems lwjgl is more adaptable in the sense that it has both 2d and 3d capabilities
however using a salt offers more protection against rainbow tables precalculated hash tables so they re still worth using
get is basically just like post it just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do it
however lets say i want g to do something more complex than multiplying by 2 like ask the user for a number and add that like so
google app engine does not allow us to schedule more than 20 cron jobs
so the compiler can t make the optimization because it can t tell if you wanted the exact behavior where multiplying is better or the implemented behavior where the scale of sum affects the result of the addition
in this case using malloc and free is likely easier though to help with compatibility you may want to define them as new and delete
i m guessing maybe ie s js engine is a little slower than firefox google-chrome which allows the user to do things they shouldn t but i have no idea how to confirm this or how to deal with it
this might look a little nicer than md5 hash but you would have to ensure url strings are not used several times
an m3u file is nothing more than a text file listing mp3 and or other format digital audio files to be interpreted by player software as a series of audio files to be played in succession
post isn t more secure than get
but i am very interested how to add function if i will have two or more loans with different min max loans min max months and monthly fee
any ideas how to use the command dir to more than 1 folder in one command
using post prevents this particular attack but is this actually any more secure than using get
the get request is marginally less secure than the post request
use post instead of get it s better
edit in response to the comment armadillo does not require lapack but works better with it and better still with tuned blas
to be able to express what you were trying to do the operator would have to be able to do more than just boolean because right now your has a bool and int around it
edit - now that i think about it i m not sure why your image would appear smaller unless your screens had a greater dpi than hdpi
then make changes to that choice either as an optimisation float takes up less space than double so if you are storing a very large number of them that might be a reasonable choice to better match some outside-imposed criteria or because it won t suffice when you need to use long rather than int
but if you d like to extends this api to be used by the external services then you ll be in a much better position with implements oauth 2.0 using doorkeeper because you can easily configure for example a authorization code grant for them
first you can use double-quotes or q it just takes more work than single-quotes or q
which brings me to the point - if transaction ids are per savings account they would be sequential in other words you will be better off with the qlist or even better a qvector because it will be a little more efficient since you will only be appending transactions
it is working only for simple .php files but wordpress is more complex and after long period of loading it show elgg nothing found site loaded
a tablet offers more screens space than a phone
so in this labelling scheme left children are 2 i+1 more than their parent where i is the height of the child while right children are 1 more than their parent
i am using udp because it is much faster than tcp but sometimes i need the know for sure if the packet reached to the other side in my program i can not use tcp at all so i am sending ack packets
if you site is located on single box you will get much better results with apc which unlike memcached is not distributed by nature
now my question is if there s any circumstances that if we use declarative too much it will confuse the developer who read the code and switching back to imperative is a better solution
i have been trying get data out of new reddit post but theres limitation where you cant get data from more than 100 post
is this why post method is more preferred than get or does it really matter in any case if it internally uses post or get
if you really want all 8 bytes in a single number then you need to read more than the unsigned short
thus i think vaadin is more suitable for intranet and takes less time to develop your app while smartgwt is better for more complex gui or unstable connections where additional roundtrips matter
as an aside i would suggest a while loops would be a bit clearer than a for-loop without a next clause
i would not mind changing to for example bazaar or git if needed i am a bit afraid of git to be honest everything i read about git seems 10x more technical than anything i read about mercurial or bazaar and installing it on windows seems to imply installing all sorts of secondary software it seems but that is another matter
i have these two dropdownlist that are supposed to be for age and i want to make it so that you cant make min age higher than max age
but its parent is greater than or equal to w so at some level of the tree one of the children of the greatest element is w
not sure why you just accepted a terribly biased answer like best solution stick with coldfusion or railo from coldfusion is just better
first one margin auto is better if you can know width of container list and you don t want centre content of this container
there is no need to do anything to make bundler work with rvm but there is one thing about bundler that makes it harder to use
i also had good result with umbraco cms it s a bit more lean than dotnetnuke but not as user friendly and definitely not as popular
note that if you expect more than one max min then cv minmaxloc is not sufficient since it returns only a single point
whether writing the for-loop like that is a good idea or why is it not just using the erase-remove idiom are different issues as a matter of fact the previous loops is arguably better than erase-remove for a list the concrete situation is that the semantics have changed and because the type is syntactically compatible with the previous one the compiler will not notice that the code is wrong it will not point you to that function and chances are that you will not review rewrite it
on the php docs link above they say a put request is much simpler than a post request when uploading file along with this advantage what other advantages disadvanatges do the put has got compared to the post
i don t really think that jtable will help you here anyhow better than jlist - it has the same rendering strategy
union all performs better than union union works like distinct first order by then remove duplicates
in fact each crossover or mutation has less than a 1 chance of producing viable offspring
i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying
this access is more restricted than public and protected but less restricted than private
the trials concur with each other if the max is less than twice the min â the trials concur with each other
like the rest of rest wadl is lightweight easier to understand and easier to write than wsdl
i can t find a way to stop non-flex divs to become larger than their parent when their combined children s height gets too tall
you ll probably find that lxml runs faster than beautifulsoup but in my uses beautifulsoup was very easy to learn and use and handled typical crappy html as found in the wild well enough that i don t have need for anything else
when you re not worrying about shadowing this is more flexible if the named of the object changes
third since the question is tagged multithreading if the old process is running more than one pthreads then the new process inherits all the mutexes conditions etc of the old process in the state they were in when fork was called
this can be done in much better fashion by avoiding for-loop provided if you choose to change your arrays structure with predefined index some thing like var
pre-aggregation with counters requires 1 get + 1 put which is more expensive than just puts
tablelayout gives you a good mechanism for rows and columns managing width and height is easier but you d need more code to change the placement of all controls if you want to remove one from the form dynamically
i think the argumentexception is more appropriate because the invalidoperationexception documentation says that the object itself on what the method is called has to be in an invalid state right
in my experience this is a much simpler sell than trac bugzilla and all the rest
i would see if i got better results with isnull instead of coalesce
plus once spdy becomes more common ssl slow down won t really account for anything much
which i think makes sense because extends from a class should take higher priority than implements from an interface
i would suggest scheduling your jobs using something more sophisticated than cron
i also find ant with ivy to be better documented than maven although that s not too difficult
however i found that vmware is much more stable full screen resolution much much better to handle the iphone connection via usb and i didn t have yet any crash when on virtualbox it s quite often
edit since you say you can t add a none option and want to use a checkbox even though i strongly disagree on checkbox where a radio button is more appropriate - a common ui error .
however i think that ecj is even better than javac my opinion .
plenty of others don t use a delimiter at all and require you to start a new segment polygons if you re more than x distance away from the last point. furthermore these things often wind up being multi-gb ascii files so reading the entire thing into memory can be impractical
to prevent children divs to become larger than the parent you have to set an overflow
here in so i found a lot of questions asking something similar and the answers normally said you can use cglib or asm or javassist is better than cglib or bcel is old and is dying or asm is the best because it gives x and y
so make sure you code has a working set of less than 16 128bit vectors or 32 64bit vectory at any time
an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function
whilst somewhat similar to skype facetime and facebook video chat google hangout focuses more on face-to-face-to-face group interaction as opposed to one-on-one video chats and utilizes sophisticated technology to seamlessly switch the focus to the person currently chatting
so in simple terms this should give you a feel for why division and hence modulo is slower computers still have to do long division in the same stepwise fashion tha you did in grade school
if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it
after that is done you can go into security details where get is slightly less secure than post - see the comments for details.
i have fireworks 8 as well as photoshop cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with fireworks
anyway if you re willing to do advanced 3d stuff mayavi is way better than matplotlib
while wordpress is great the simplicity of it gets the better of it joomla is far more flexible and has a huge support network and extensions library
for internal work i ve found out that fossil uses little bandwidth much less than cvs or svn and is able to synchronize huge projects in a blitz even via an adsl or a 3g connection
if necessary i am willing to use the twitter api directly to do the search instead of using rss but for my purposes using a feed is more ideal
finally if you want to optimize your program to number of lines - trading off engineering practices - you ll have a shorter program with mouseenter and mouseleave events
my reasoning for this is that i may want to add aesthetics to the plot and ggplot2 allows this more than plot
there is also the wrinkle that typically a double consists of more bits than an int does - so by printing in this way your code is interpreting random memory to the right of x as data
another alternative that people might mention is clion which is from jetbrains but its closed-source not well supported and whilst it might look nicer than qt-creator it has more or less the same features but is much more resource-heavy and laggy so i d pass on that
if you take the binary search approach then there is scope for doing this smartly - spotting when successive tests in the same binary search return the same letter and so assuming that as a minimum range size then aborting any possible range that s shorter than that - but chances are you d do better to code this up using the separate searches
these two lines are in the .htaccess at root level of the site - the configuration in the main httpd.conf is considerably more complex but just that sets particular options for the ssl within the admin area and doesn t affect non-admin areas so i know this works whether it will for you i cannot say
i think the idea of having a single event aggregator for parent module and its children is cleaner
mp3 or aac compression format is suited for music content and amr is better suited for speech content
however they may be cheaper to operate depending on how much data you are expecting to store with each session key holding large quantities of data in ram is typically more expensive than storing on disk
you can of course improve it for instance using a proper callback rather than an inline event and do more with it show hide the play button but this is it in its simplest form
even if the hypothesis of the while loops being faster than the for-loop were true and it s not the loops you d had to change optimize wouldn t be the outer ones but the inner ones because those are executed more times
i have a clue to the answer may be currentculture is for a broader class of language en and uiculture is for more specific variant of the language like en-us but am not sure if this is true
a get is a bit quicker and than a post in an ajax scenario
cpython probably has better ide support at present than ironpython - so this may be a factor in the choosing of one over the other
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url
ironically enough its object model show more details than it hide - good for learning but bad for abstraction
i will not argue why and if nexus is better than artifactory as it would not be fair and would only cause flame wars
your fixheap2 fails to consider the case where both children are valid but have keys smaller than the parent s
i just want to know if i use post method for login api then is it safer than get method
it may have more than 2 children and one child may act as a parent for the next level and another may not. not binary tree
if for any node total resource allocation makes more than all ram cores disk available you are at risk most often at risk of spark task or yarn child being unable to start
in a heap the parent is always less than all of its children or greater than all of its
while it is true that a simple shift or add is often faster than a multiplication but not always â multiplication are faster than you might think the only way you could use it here inside the loop is if you first checked to see that you were supposed to be multiplying by 2 and the cost of doing that check more specifically the cost of making the decision as a result of that check is far more costly than a simple integer multiplication
in my view cakephp seems much more lighter then codeigniter but i never used either one so i can t judge
most particular platforms restrict the list of calls that can be interrupted to a smaller set than pthreads allows so you d have to look at the linux docs to be sure exactly what is and isn t eintr-safe but the epoll family of methods along with read recv write send and friends are almost certain to be unsafe
though earlier uiview and uiscrollview have the same area after keyboard shown the blue uiview becomes smaller but its subviews button text fields is outside its area
this should be producing a topological sort but so far i consistently get one value less than i put in as far as number of vertices and none of the number match those i ve inputted
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie
obviously in this case the call could return more than one item if there was more than one folder named test in your directory tree
as craig revealed within the announcement of swift it is said to be faster than objective-c by far
sctp is not better than tcp in any way but it does something different
needless to say each product has more than one prop which is kept in the producthas table
in fact when a tablet has a larger than standard screens size the tablet with detachable keyboards available these days mobile versions of the site can look over-optimised for space which is the reason why browsers allow tablet users to opt to display sites in desktop mode
n s e w nw sw ne se. you keep going until the distance to the buckets and therefore all the points in them is greater than your minimum range
the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on firefox and works even worse on opera
now i assume you are worried your techno might not read a compressed mp3 which should be smaller than a wav from my memories
is the best solution to add a new column called engmaterial and add the english translation there or is it possible to solve this in a better way with localization in .net
if an element has only 1 child then the child is placed below the parent on the same x co-ordinate if the parent has more than one child then the children are placed with equal spaces apart and the parent needs to be in the middle above the children to two equal length lines join to both the children from the parent
if you re fine with moving to another text editor then i would strongly recommend geany which does the same thing as gedit but is more fully-featured and can allow for execution of code in the same application
a solid state drive may even be faster than a ram disk which surprised me
the trackpad is much more sensitive and can get the breakpoint increment correctly but the mouse wheel ends up scrolling through the section much quicker without correctly keeping up with the proper frame rate so i never end up reach the final frame by the end of the section
post is not more secure than get as itâ s also send unencrypted
i did a search on the web but i was unable to find any evidence that suggests that pypy s memory usage is much more than cpython
i heard correct me if i am wrong that innodb is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to myisam s table locking
this is a very simple case which will do that asuming your children always have a higher id than their parent
malloc is much easier to implement if there is no free
btw microsoft azure storage explorer in my case showed only some subset of folder which is much worse than displaying duplicated directory so i switched to azure explorer mentioned above and it s worth recommending
eta to answer your question in more general terms let s say we had the number of subjects and levels set up in advance increasing the number of factors is more complicated unless i m mistaken because then it would no longer be a two-dimensional matrix
so in my view using swing is simply easier unless you have more experience in swt
the indirection has some costs and is kinda ugly so if you want to keep this functionality you might be better off by implementing accessor methods and only log in a subclass of core
if you take a look at the associated guides you ll see core animation and layers does require hit testing though that s relatively easy but it s far cleaner than the uiview doing all the drawing and more efficient than many subviews
in general it s more noticeable with mouse than keyboard
for using a fileformat i thought mp3 uses much less memory than wav because all the formats are based on wav but just compressed
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining
to that extent i had to make a few changes to my server-side presentation layer but as a result i think my client-side code is cleaner and more focused on processing actual user events
data density in code128 is better than code39 - since it gets mentioned that often in other replies
if you have a customer who is willing to work with you a bit it might shed some light on the situation to get a crash dump with adplus or maybe simpler with sysinternals procdump when the error message is showing
i have an app that uses the public part of the twitter api the on who not requires to login but with the update the login is required so i need to implement oauth i ve seen there are libraries like twitter4j who makes this easier but my app has a lot of code and i don t wanna rewrite it not now so i ve think to use scribe or oauth-signpost but i dont realy know how to
maybe this would have all been better with boost but i m still learning stl and didn t go that way
you could try to add some value to the double to make sure it s bigger or smaller than an int can be
if you want to do this - and are in-fact okay with having more larger hash data to store compare - you would be much better advise to simply run a different hash function other than md5 that is either more secure and or uses a larger number of bits
there ll be no functional difference between the constructor being public or being protected but making it protected gives a clearer indication of the intended use
there is a default limit of post method which is 2mb which is way higher than get
and one more suggestion instead of using qtreewidget i think qtreeview is a better choice if you can explain the issue a bit more maybe i can provide some sample code
it works fine even for italics but i m aware that the user s browser is being asked to make a best-guess here and have noticed that google-chrome will make individual chars appear slightly fatter than firefox when i do things this way
am i better off storing my screens in variables and reusing them when i switching screens or is it better to dispose of each screens when i m done with it and then create a new instance of the screens type i intend to switching to
i suspect the computational demands of flac decoding are probably considerably less than ogg and if dsp gets you excited taking the time to figure all this stuff out is 100 worth it even if the flash route possibly leads to disappointment
this response thus assumes that a request using the post verb would not use the uri to transfer sensitive information or it would be no better than get
this really helps keeps parent branch more stable than children
personally i develop on the windows but deploy on debian where couldn t find the scrapyd package at all at the time i was working on it and noticed that performance of scrapy is considerably worse than on linux box so you might reconsider your target
it s very heavyweight and not fully featured for forms so prism or freshmvvm works better as these are designed for forms from the ground up but if you do use mvvmcross for forms its easy to go native if you need
and since the children in your home block start their own stacking context one level higher than the parent your home li can never be above the items inside it
get and post are relatively common put is less common so may not be covered in your server implementation
using proprietary extensions from firefox is almost as myopic -- you ll have a hard time convincing all visitors to switch to firefox for your site from ie safari or whatever else they prefer and although the range of devices on which you can install firefox is broader than those on which you can install ie you re still cutting off devices such as iphones and android a segment of the market that s growing much faster than traditional pcs
i did something like this in java me and performance was way better than doing post get
also maven projects come with a different directory structure and seems to be doing much more than what ant does in the spring source tutorial
about comparing double - since they are double not int it is better to compare the difference below half-tick or something like that but need to be careful with that
although post is more secure as compared to get when ssl is present
personally i prefer jackson as according to test benchmarks it s faster than gson
ok after a whole day of trying to get this to work i ve abandoned uploadify and am now using plupload which seems much better
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it
i m more familiar with objective-c than swift and haven t had a chance to test this yet but this should be close
bear in mind that the conversion is not trivial if the png is true colour or has transparency gif is more limited
tee then writes more data t and tries to read from the pipe then goes to sleep until cat writes more data
because in my server logs it s showing a lot of post with million of ping while the other pages have been get is a smaller amount of number
for this reason you need to either try and be smarter than just setting a limit or set you limit a bit higher than the minimum operating range of the sensor
i think updating dependencies with maven is pretty easier than dealing with ant but of course you could select the other way if you feel more conifrtable
i feel a little less than swift asking this one but i have become exhausted going in circles on the swift objective-c function calls
i know that ie s javascript engine is slower than google-chrome and firefox but i m throwing this out there to see if the so community can pick apart my code and suggest better ways of doing this as i am not the greatest front end programmer
get is faster than post
if h is larger than your pie-chart radius you are placing the label outside the charts you should consider a constant r for that with a nice looking line
the above query only works if the parent id is a lower number than all the children
at first i tried reading the original pdf with a fileinputstream and finding the signature hex strings to split it into smaller files with a fileoutputstream as i have done with jpgs
however i realize you probably want it to be more than the width and height so you don t see the edges of the shapes but i figure you can fix that up
while png is definitely better that gif occasionally there is a use case for needing to stay in gif format
and then i saw that they put functions under transform that did much more than just get data
however after attempting multiple times i m actually getting worse results with ogg files than i am with mp3 s - but the problem is the opposite ie when the loop is supposed to go back to the start of the ogg file it actually seems to start again but from about 2 or 3 seconds into it ie no gap it just doesn t loop correctly
your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like innodb handles indexes better than myisam anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query
question is there a way i can switching these two col-md 6 s around when the screens is less that x pixels across
i had previously sent those commands via bluetooth but the connection fails too often to be useful and is slower than usb
i couldn t understand why paxos is better for split-brain scenarios or other network failures than traditional bully algorithm because i can easily find out when quorum of nodes leave from the cluster without using raft
here a child will be having more than one parent and a parent has more than 2 children
my question is that will postgresql suffice for having such a large number of entries while performing both read and writes or should i switch to mysql because i heard mysql is more advantageous to read heavy tasks
my intuition is that transient properties would incurr less overhead than persistent properties because they do not need to be persistent and read from the database so converting them to persistent properties will likely only make things slightly worse
so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit
code is almost working but children divs are a bit wider than parent and i am getting a wrong value of offsetwidth
i m very sorry for the long question but i thought instead of dividing the question into several post it is more convenient if they are put into one place
as long as the dataframe is small your assumption that the put process is faster than the get seems true we can fetch all 5 items within one loop of while not q.empty
the desktop tablet version is working fine its when the screens gets smaller and the smartphone version loads the image doesn t work as it should
my only problem is that is seems that using uicollectionview is a better approach and i have read some seemingly off-hand comments about icarousel being a poor approach
the for-loop will take too long if my arrays has more than 100 items
in a heap when there is any change in the heap insert delete update then the heap is restructured in a way such that the common priniciple is maintained in above case the parent remains always smaller than its children
i could do a post but get is much faster
if i make a mistake and multiplying a number by 1.0 instead of 1 and i do not use any compiler optimization then my multiplication will last much longer than multiplying a number by 1
branching around whether it is with goto or break just makes it harder
so if you re on such a processor and if you have no dependencies in your code you don t need the result of one sin computation in order to start the next one then you probably won t get much faster than using sin and cos directly as they will be fully pipelined achieving an effective rate of 1 per cycle
you can take a look on gradle which for me could provide more freedom than maven but is easier to use than ant
i thought there were quite a few more with list foldable traversable but it looks like most were made more generic some time ago as i only see the old less generic type signatures in old stack overflow message board questions
if there is a run for a particular serialnum earlier than the minimum date of the range it won t be excluded
if you are working on physical machine that has cable and wireless connectivity then you will have more than one ethernet adaptor choise
according to benchmark both sefan and the while loops answers take the same ammount of time fruity the while loops answers take a bit shorter with the for-loop answers in second but the multiple loops do answers take far longer
i know that in general for a set of range if the max of the mins is less than the min of the maxes than they intersect but the circular nature of degrees makes this a bit more complicated
since the upgrade the content authors are complaining that the experience editor performance is much slower than previous versioning
this could mean that put is now slower than get and we have to wait
there seem to be some issues in the windows phone framework and in the windows store framework in fact related to elements that are children of other elements and how when the parent element has been destroyed the framework thinks the child element still belongs to it elements can t have more than one parent
more generally you can always just try multiplying the base by itself a number of times no greater than the modulo and you are bound to find a cycle
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great
it works as i want but it looks a bit messy and i ve read that sometimes breaking from an outer for-loop within a .each loops is more neatly achieved with javascript
you might benefit from combining each proj into a single war but i do think this is really one of those the grass is always greener problems
my understanding is that although dbcontext is newer it s not necessarily better than objectcontext it just provides a different api that might be considered simpler but doesn t that depend on the use case
if you want to do more than just get the uniq output you could put your own java class or command line program rather than use usr bin uniq
regarding the last portion of your question the number of bits of int is always more than chars so it won t cause a problem
so a protected is more restrictive than public and private is more restrictive than protected
if the factors is larger than the golden mean they never will
if you didn t implement comparable and didn t supply a comparator it is much better to error out than to just silently sort your list in semi-random order
mockito s a much older library than jmockit so you could expect that it would have many more features
if you switch between portrait and landscape when viewing this on an ipad3 you ll need to refresh the browser window between switches you can see that portrait mode is choppier than landscape
you may also need an ivalueconverter since triggers only test if a value is equal to something and you may need to test if the screen height width is greater than or less than a particular value
if it s only an accessor getter giving back some data than a properties fits better
for more complex reports you ll need to have more control over grouping and sorting controlling the order of both
there is an addon that can even remove the menu bar â you ll need to learn keyboard shortcuts this is a good idea anyway moving a hand to from the mouse is much slower
but this is not a good regex because matches zero or more times with greedy for every search it will go to the end then it will backtracking to match the
i would say behat + mink is more useful for that purpose
one important reason is because hex is alot shorter and easier to read than binary is for humans
you can change your database to myisam -- i m guessing you re only reading from the tables in the database otherwise if you have read write transactions innodb is the better choice
we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use
some people say get can be less safe than post -- but to the seasoned user this doesn t make any significant difference because they can intercept and modify headers of the request
i don t think there can be more than one get or post per request but per open connection certainly
if it s faster than sin cos then you can use the identity
or taking a leaf out of friedi s book taking advantage of sorting the array first but using reduce instead of filtering which is slightly simpler because it means we do not need a iife to close around a previous item
the rest are at least as large as chars and it s hard to imagine how you d make the i o system work correctly if int wasn t larger than chars
using compatibility as the central point in the versioning number makes it easier for users especially if te product is a library to judge whether or not they can expect a smoothe and safe upgrade or not
if the right side the binary side is greater than or equal to the hex side then you print true if not then you print false
if you don t understand the subtleties between push vs pull architecture then i recommend that you start with xmlreader because pull is simpler to understand and easier to visualize
likely not as cheap as xor against n values but seems like there s possibility for better quality results at a minimal extra cost especially if the data being hash is much larger than the salt value
1 split those tests to unit and acceptance and use a tool like codeception to help you do acceptance which is way more elegant than phpunit for this kind of test
i m looking for suggestions for a workable stack a good ui framework that will work well with ember.js or an alternatives â perhaps i would be better off with angular and ionic etc
the problem is if the parent s width is 100 and the sum of the children is more than 100 they start a new line rather then cause a horizontal scroll
i have hinted at my analysis of the problem finding the common range of depth values across all datasets and you should be able to track through how i have implemented this in excel to cater for cases where some datasets might contain depth values which are less than the minimum of the common range or which are greater than its maximum or possibly both
since max is larger than min one of the two will always happen
as a pragmatist i m inclined to use get because implementing it is way simpler than post
the main problem i know is the while loops the logic behind it is not correct because last didah is always bigger than n for-loop counter
there is a perception that udp is faster than tcp but i think it depends on the situation - take a look at this discussion for some further discussion on speed reliability etc between udp and tcp go down through all the high scored answers
it might have been faster for listing whole directory but when filtering out files and only accepting folder it takes far more time
it s horses for courses personally i m much happier with textmate or vim and a nice cup of coffee but it s what feels more comfortable to you
if you want to store text data only using textarea or textbox is easier
even though they re hash salt it s still better that attackers do not see them
things like cmd c dir don t know why - and yes i do cmd c dir in cases i am in some kind of shared network folder with thousands of files and ls is significantly slower than dir
however i read that swift was the successor of objective-c and i would feel more comfortable with swift syntax
again though the time profiling instrumentation is far better suited to the job and it definitely works
i would say vaadin would be easier over wicket as the default ui elements look really good
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct
all 3 states are much more than an imageview + textview so i went for 3 different layouts for every state and only 1 of them is visible at a time
today png is much more popular than tiff so if you re writing files outside of your own data store png would be a more common choice and you d need to work through nsimagerep to get there
i did some reading on kombu and it seems to be able to do what i m thinking of although at a much lower level than celery
i m looking to see if anyone has a workable solution so i can basically switching between this big banner and a smaller format for mobile browsers where the screens size is smaller and doesn t break my responsive site
one of the reasons we want to move is because swift is more secure than objective-c
parent are always at a lower index than their children so it is ordered
im trying very hard to like virtualbox but so far i find it so much worse than vmware in so many ways
instead knowing that we want to grouping by these columns we can make the application code to do so simpler by sorting by these fields
just wanted to weigh in my two cents what serialworm and thephpdeveloper said share the fact that memory ram is much faster than any disk io bound operation you come up with
i need to set image-type children position to absolute in their div parent and keep the lower section under this parent
i suggest that you start with scheme and then move on to common lisp as scheme is simpler
apc access is a bit faster something like 5 times faster than memcached if i remember correctly as it s only local -- no network involved
so i repeat and clarify my question from the heading how would i split the byear column into three or more columns with or spaces as delimiter
the first load involves reading alot from the hard disk which is slow even ssd is slower than ram subsequent loads should be faster though 3 seconds on the ssd seem to be odd
some people may argue with me on this one but i find pypy to be faster than cpython
i also know implements runable is better than extends thread
the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that arenâ t under the attackerâ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual
cdi is so much more mature than seam 2 bijection jsf 2 is so much easier than jsf 1.2 that any kind of application development will simply be much more fun with seam 3
i am not sure it can satisfy you but hebrew test is 4 times slower than persian
i ve found some things online that state that the height must always be greater than the width and have seen in the java source checks for this with accompanying messages that this is the case but cannot find a reason why
it will continue to be available but since opus is better than speex in all aspects users are encouraged to switch
while dotnetnuke is a much bigger market it seems to be crowded with a lot of competition versus umbraco which is smaller but it looks like it lacks modules in certain categories
if the factors is smaller than the golden mean 1.6 and the previous allocations are contiguous with each other they ll eventually add up to a chunk that can satisfy a later requirement
however if you don t have specific reasons to use anycpu then you could still use x86 because in some cases the performances are better than 64bit code
nunit is more popular because it was there first therefore more articles about it on the web and better tooling and because most programmers don t care about or need the advanced features that mbunit offers
also about firefox i know still less than google-chrome and i m not sure about how it innerly manage resources among threads and if it is even possible to achieve what i want but if possible i d need to do the same work with firefox threads
since im using fixtures would this maybe be a db cleaner issue im not using it right now as im only using pre-created fixtures currently i ve never used db cleaner with minitest as im only familiar with using it with rspec and factory girl
if you don t want to remember or google up all those methods every time you need to iterate an arrays just stick to the good old for-loop which is way faster anyway
splitactionbar works only on phones because the screens size is much smaller than tablet and it takes space at the bottom for extra space for your action items
now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it
the content is longer than the screens of my tablet so i need to scroll vertically on a card
for each new number after the first check if it is lower than min or higher than max and in that case save that instead
yum makes it easier to maintain groups of machines without having to manually update each one using rpm
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors
i do not want to know when or if to use shift operators in my code i am interested in why multiplication is faster than shifting bits to the left whereas division is not
while webclient may appear to be easier to use than httpwebrequest it is less flexible and will automatically perform it s callback on the ui thread and if you re downloading files in the background you almost certainly don t want this
i m assuming using https without a ssl certificate is atleast more secure than doing the exact same connection over plain http since atleast it s encrypted and an evildoer would have to make a much larger effort to intercept en decrypt the information
we use ave to see which rank are greater than the median for each group and we select where those are true
though all data is usually unsafe basically user data sessions are safer than the post or get or cookie or simply request and some server variables since you set it yourself
since parent have a higher z-index than its children you need to change the default browser stacking behavior
however i wonder if this is the best way of doing this if you want to observe specific behaviour you might be better off isolating a specific input file and debugging against a local pseudo-cluster and if you want system metrics you could do worse than give ganglia a lookm as it is pretty mauch already built into hadoop
i understand that the compiler isn t happy because a double might be larger than an int can hold but this particular control is guaranteed to be a value from 1 to 10 so i know that it will be okay
i don t want to hide overflowing part by overflow hidden i want to force parent div.alert height to be not lower than its children
if your getter takes more than one argument it s not called a setter anymore

is type get faster than type post cause i am curious how both work
if you want to do a split slice operation on a pie charts first you need to create a pie charts with slices.here from what i understand you tried to give the option split charts first which actually is to make differrent pie charts in the same row or column which needs more than one pie-chart
instead of net http i can use httparty curb rest client or typhoeus which makes everything easier but i can t find any similar solutions to replace enhance net ftp
another reason but rather a minor one is that get is easier to exploit that post as there are more ways to trigger get request than to trigger post request
assuming the highest priority is at the top each element must be no higher than its parent and at least as high as either of its children
in general avoid awt for swing which has much greater power and flexibility although it too is showing its age just less so than awt
every time a rank finds a larger number than that stored have it send its new max to the root rank
under a gnu linux distribution like ubuntu everything is much more easier and you can just plug in your device without installing anything you just have to set the right permissions for the device once
there will be only one consider running as suggestion when the max isn t actually greater than the min either because max is an empty tuple a none-ple
this is an option which can be expanded very easily to test more than simple min max
when i reload my html pages its button select and checkbox are goes added more and more.because all the html data fetch from a data base and after added new things in the page i store all the html of the page in data base and when i display this page agiain becuase of jquery mobile its button select and checkbox are increased check here visit jsfiddle.net sharma9853 gbe6p 7
i know that xlsxwriter is way faster than xlwings and have functionality to add border but it is just a writer it can t update already existing spreadsheet
and also i don t want use for-loop because it would cause trouble if the arrays size becomes bigger
with all of these declared transitioning between portrait and landscape is much smoother with much less lag
i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires
if you ask if a uncompressed wav which contains pcm data is better than mp3 then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data
if i resize the window and a widget with a highcharts is bigger than the window i want to resize it to make it smaller and gridster should recalculate the positions of the others
this is done on an extremely large image and i feel vips might do a better job than opencv on this
i need to connect more than one keyboard mouse with a single computer
i am using custom delegate methods but when i run this the get request is performed earlier than the post so i cannot get the key before the get is done
based on my own experience i would look into a gem like minimagick which provides a nice interface to imagemagick which is a more common library for the tasks you re trying to do
i ll get better with formatting and being more specific with the post
fadeout is simpler because it will hide it for you automatically when it is done so you can save that code and it automatically waits for the animation to be done before hiding the element something your current code was not doing
all works fine over the past few deploys i had to add some columns to my table and due to upgrade statements that are executed if the old database versioning is lesser then a certain database versioning
while users can manipulate post it s far easier to manipulate get
if you care a lot about efficiency or really need tens of thousands of connections then implementing your specific protocol in udp will always be better than tcp
is the performance of pull better than push in this scenario
this means the amount of data you could pass by using post verb is much more than by using a query string and a get method
this should handle all cases of setting the properties makes them easier to implement in your inherited classes and cleans things up
they merged with dojo which in my opinion is a better choice than dwr
update just tried it on firefox 30 and it did not experience the same slowdown in a worker thread but it was slower than google-chrome when run in the main thread
now that you accept more than simple get post json or xml your model will have to distinguish between each request type and know how to parse them
i haven t played around with it recently but i think bcolz is more flexible here in terms of mixing dtypes but doesn t give you all the pandas dataframe conveniences obviously
puma will tend to optimize itself by spawning more threads and its performance should range from no worse than unicorn in the pure cpu case to being vastly better than unicorn in the case of an app that sleeps a lot
so if it s greater than 0 show the button otherwise hide it
post has one more letter in it than get so it s less compact
i guess the reason you observe this behaviour with just a guess it could be wrong is because the parent process is terminated earlier than its children so your terminal s prompt is printed before some of the children s output
i had better luck with the x86 one than the 64bit version in win 7
creating elements on mouseover mouseout is much more work on the browser then having those elements created already in the markup with display none
with spreadsheet formulas i don t think that you can do much better than that min max construct
programmers like to use this property to speed up programs because it s easy to chop off some number of bits but performing a modulo is much harder it s about as hard as doing a division
the problem is that i need to draw some simple objects points lines especially rectangles with double float decimal precision it doesn t matter with more precision than an int on a windows form i m using visual studio but i can t find anything
vs.net makes tons of i o calls and ram disk are much faster than real disk
depending on your specific situation these two handlers tend to be better choices than using mouseover and mouseout due to the way they handle event bubbling for descendants of the bound objects
recently someone suggested to me that division is always more expensive than multiplication
i give up using popupwindow and use dialog instead after some tests i found dialog is far better than popupwindow there are quite a few problems with popupwindow
i have a similar problem to this question only i am not learning generics so want a practical solution and my method is returning more than an int or a double
recently i ve stumbled upon a parralel.for loops that performs way better than a regular for-loop for my purposes
the bson becomes even more annoying to work with when exporting data from mongo to another db platform this is the case when dealing with big data that is collected and you want to merge it with some properties from the back office mongodb this means a lot of pain you need to transform the binary objectid to a string in order to join with the id in different platforms that do not use bson representation
in my opinion post requests are not more secure than get requests and the data can be easily intercepted
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases
alternatively you could accept a-za-z0-9 0 4000 note the space which should get you more than one words but probably not anything after the first punctuation
firstly post can seem more secure than get
a dawg has better memory performance if the strings have many common suffixes but they are more expensive and difficult to build and update so start with a trie
not sure about this but multiplication should take more time than addition so it s slowing it down ex
what i find strange is that the getter for distance depends on status and the setter acts more like a setter for status
if your company s concern is to avoid big unknown libraries which is prefectly understandable i d advise you to stick with lwjgl which is smaller that jogl
the smaller the dash symbol is the better results you will get the existing api code doesn t seem to cut off the symbol at the final vertex of a polyline segment and doesn t seem to account for the section of the symbol that went past the polyline after the vertex
i speak of great experience in this area as i have developed my own cms over a cumulation of years and selling the cms becomes even much tougher as joomla wordpress and drupal have a price point that you cannot complete with
since we are dealing with images and changing them on change of select i would prefer changing the src of image rather than using show hide method.it is more simpler
a normal 3 will be treated as int but in the test function you are retrieving double which are bigger than an int on most platforms and you might end up reading wrong locations which inturn leads to exc_bad_access run time signal being generated
for some reason fadein works better than show or simply removing a hidden class via removeclass if you take that approach
the capturing group 1 in the first pattern is greedy it first matches everything and takes as less as it backtracking
now do i have to make a query so that tuples v1 v2 are selected where the max review of v2 is strictly less than the min review of v1
i have tried weka too but mallet is smarter than weka on this aspect
i m sticking with firefox debugging of my angular 2 app outside of vs code as its user experience is better than google-chrome especially when working with typescript files so i ll stick with that for now unless i can figure this out
pig in general has a very limited number of evaluation functions and when you start doing things a bit more complicated than min max count you need to get comfortable with writing udfs
so what makes geddy significantly better than connect
which will lead to performance issue all programs will be work slower because read info from disk is slower than from ram
so if your get request is longer than 255 bytes it s advised to use post requests instead
remember malloc is quite expensive action and free costs even much more than malloc
a bitmap of a screenshot can get really big on a tablet since the screens resolution is likely higher
keep in mind however that following the robustness principle of be conservative in what you send liberal in what you accept the interpretation of int in the boolean context is somewhat more relaxed
it s not clear to me what you want but i ll mention that the date class also has a compareto method which can be used to determine with one call if two date objects are equals or if they aren t equals which occurs sooner
from there you can use having to make sure the max review of the first user is less than the min review of the other user
additionally ajax is nothing more than get or post requests that a script carries out for you asynchronously allowing you to use the server responses in a document without reloading the entire page
if you have more than one ethernet wireless cards name might change a bit.
2.the division by 2 can be done by bit - shift operation is it really slower than addition
i am using view flipper to show bunch on images like a slider where i implemented the functionality of swipe left and right to switching images now some of my images are larger than the screens size in terms of height are getting hidden
if you are sending stuff there are a lot more considerations than just shipping costs you may need to fill in specific tax forms for some countries and depending on what your site is selling you may need special processing for some countries try sending coffee to thailand -- you need to obtain permission from thier ministry of agriculture
when get is better than post
gave up and switched to sharpziplib as it doesn t blow up on simple extract but sure would be nice to know what was wrong with dotnetzip it has a nicer api
which doesn t do what you want because multiplication has higher precedence than addition
i have tried creating an if statement inside a for-loop to say if loops is more than 0 and the div is open then run the code so if the div isn t showing then do nothing - but this doesn t work
it s highly recommended way to implement screens switching with navigation drawer and you ll experience much less pain and see that screens switching is way faster
i decided on nvidia for a couple of reasons while ati might be faster on paper nvidia has a more mature platform and more documentation so it will be possible to get closer to the peak performance on this platform
all i changed was the first compareto comparison to be less than instead of less than or equals to
worse with mysql if you drop multiple indexes on the same table it will re-copy the table once for each index you re removing instead of being smart and re-copying the data once without all the indexes you re dropping. is something like this happening with postgresql
i would be very interested in seing the solution in objective-c also but swift is more important for me here
anything that you do with http is more or less equivalent with spdy and neither is really anything but an implementation detail of your soa work
i have a method that returns a but i want to allow for more numbers than an unsigned short can hold so i would like to convert it to a before i add my bigger numbers to it
i have two primeface calenders which are used to select from and to dates.i have set the max and min dates for the two calenders which are updated using the ajax dateselect event so that the max date of from is never after the min date of to and the min date of to is never greater than the max date of from .my code is something similar to this
in ssms it takes more than 1 minute to complete while in sqlcmd it takes no longer than one second
first it creates 10 5gb files 50gb is way more than machine ram so not much help by os file-cache then starts a zookeeper client which is supposed to keep its connection with the zookeeper server up by sending pings heartbeats regularly then makes 10 threads doing random-access into the 10 files creating a lot of disk io but really no real usage of the cpu
correct me if im wrong but i think the apk for mobile can be used to install the app in tablet.your problem would be in the ui coz mobile has smaller screens than tablet
â when using drawimage coordinates will be rounded for you you might want to do the rounding yourself since it is floor that is used and that ceil that gives smoother results
on safari everything is slower than on firefox still the object property access is more than two times faster
first fiber won t compile with apple clang because of the use of thread_local which apple does not support according to what i found online they think they can implement it better than standard llvm and don t want to introduce it only to break abi later
since eventually i d have a button that runs some script on the smeow values and send it to a different request i had a look at the tabletools plugin but it doesn t really play well with server-side tabletools is more focused on the client-side source
i think to safely use put on a public website requires even more effort than using post and is less commonly done due to potential security issues
let s boil your trouble down to this if the mouse is over #inner you can t use the usual methods spacebar arrow keys trackpad wheel to scroll #outer up and down
apache is like a 4 by 4 contains everything you need nginx is more like a ferrari not much there but it does what you need it to
while i think the move to swift is prudent but i think it overstates the case to argue that swift is significantly more secure that objective-c
firstly though we tend to use signed more than unsigned values which would lean us toward short but also ushort is not a cls-compliant type and there s hardly any point introducing an incompatibility with other .net languages in obtaining compatibility with com
one simple approach is that if the sprite is headed away from the center line the value you add subtract is larger than if the sprite is heading back towards the center line
http is slightly more performant than https as the ssl handshake doesn t need to happen however anybody hackers can see everything that your users can see
additionally i would advise that the your view explicitly checks that the request is a post and if not make the assumption that it is a get rather than the other way around as you have it this is safer as get and post are not the only request types and you definitely need to know that you are dealing with a post request if you want to deal with variables submitted in the post request
this post goes into more details how to get charles proxy work with android 7 nougat
a better word than screens is activity you switching between activities in android
note you can also use get but post is safer because the user can t change it in the url
imho activity is your controller or perhaps presenter a la mvp is the better architectural analogy layout xml and their constituent views are the view layer and your database is your model
given these last two complications i am leaning towards a browser plugin as the solution probably firefox since low-level http stuff seems to be better supported than in google-chrome but i am wondering if anyone has an idea for a more cross-browser-y solution and or if there is something out there that might provide a good api for this kind of thing
i am using qt 4.8.3 and unless this is definitely bug in the versioning i would prefer not upgrading as from my experience upgrade bears more trouble than benefits
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp
from the link which is mentioned in question my question is that microsoft says the c# type keywords and their aliases are interchangeable but why we need aliases from my point of view boolean is more meaningful then bool and int32 is more meaningful then int then why aliases
masonry was the first one and works very well and isotope is the newer version that expanded on the original thinking along with additional features like sorting
minor differences between two identical target devices samsung galaxy tab 10.1 one tablet always performs fares better
if you are looking to measure execution performance over time scales where it matters if your thread has been preempted then you would probably be better served with a profiler vtune for instance
you are using a method to bind click event in your case is live and this has been removed in the latest jquery libraries from 1.9+ onwards so make sure your versioning is less than 1.9 or better to upgrade the library and use the recommended method for it .on to delegate the event event delegation syntax is little different with .on
you could make your css mobile-first meaning that all properties are optimized for mobile then as the screens gets wider you apply tablet and desktop optimized css for elements
the better question to ask might be which one of passenger unicorn is a better fit for containerised rails apps
fossil is another one that s easy to use i would say easier than git to learn but it uses an sqlite file to store your code and i m not sure if it scales to really big projects
it s like the measurements aren t the same and even if i use align client the twebbrowser won t fill the screens of the 7 tablet which is more or less the a4 aspect ratio

i m sure it can be accomplished with pure bokeh but i m looking to do a more advanced plot with bokeh which relies on matplotlib so i m looking to use show mpl.to_bokeh
i know sproutcore is backed by apple and looks like it is getting more popular by the day and it has a nice green website whereas javascriptmvc looks less professional with less of a following and less momentum behind it
if you need only integrals - use int if you need more precision use non-integrals double takes more space in memory and since you don t have any specific requirements concerning precision float seems to be the most reasonable choice
also note that keydown is better for this methodology as keyup will fire multiple times though i guess this will too.
if you d like to see stack trace that spans over settimeout setinterval calls then more sophisticated would be the way to go
get parameters are limited in size and post is better suited for this
get is a better method in this case than post
developers community it might seem that laravel has a larger community of developers but during my career with yii i ve found no bottleneck of having a question without an answer
for example if you start with a table and trunk adds column a and the branch adds column b then you merge trunk to branch - you cannot realistically upgrade to the versioning with both unless the branch versioning number is always greater than the trunk s upgrade script and that doesn t work if you subsequently merge trunk to the branch
but if the plotline is set much higher than the min or max data series then the plotline doesn t show on the chart at all like this jsfiddle
you can filtering by adding pagination conditions but sorting is more complicated seeing as photos can have multiple categories
while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio
i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric
perhaps you will have a more pleasant experience with iis 7.5 express as a replacement for cassini
i m searching for the best method to get result with database contain more than 100000 post and more than 100000 cat
numerical algorithms that need gradients will probably do more than max and min and other complexities can come up
if you want to schedule basic workloads based on containers you might be better off with marathon or in the future maybe aurora
yes but if joomla is any example of how hard it is to implement a complex custom website with oop then wordpress is far easier and quicker and time is money
at first i thought it had something to do with one being a for-loop and the other being a while loops but even when i reversed the order the second loops still executes slower
setinterval is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since settimeout only runs once and you need to keep on calling it
for some years now i ve just stuck to the thought that since directbytebuffer s are a direct memory mapping at os level that it would perform quicker with get put calls than heapbytebuffer s
one interesting experiment you can try is to try and malloc more memory after you free d that pointer
all right children are greater than the parent node
if your range were sorted in some manner then you could look at the extreme ends if the end s min is greater than the targetmax then say look at the range 1 4 backwards from the end etc.
but the slider won t work well it doesn t get activated is a better way to put it if i insert the code from slider.js into the chrome console hit enter - booom works perfectly i ve been looking for what the problem might be tried adding the type text javascript in the script tags added the document .ready in my jquery still nothing.
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division
i am trying to stop a textarea with autogrow.js from growing after 300px height and then destroying autogrow textarea so that it has scrollbar although the code i have used to do this is working fine i can stop the textarea from growing after 300px but when that happens the textarea becomes smaller than 300px suddenly
however my mobile site has an option that allow user to switching to desktop view if there are not fond of the mobile site but how should i do that since the javascript in my homepage will block any screens that s smaller than 1024
i m fuzzy on a lot of the finer details between jruby and mri ruby but here s what i know based off of what i ve learned using jruby
need to issue more than just get and put commands
i have also considered using game center groups to make sure you are playing a player from the same app versioning but ultimately decided that getting users to upgrade is a better plan
for example you want to use abstract-class in such a case that each of the subclassing is a more specific type of its abstract superclass fruit apple orange banana grape strawberries etc. and you want to use non-abstract superclass in a relationship such as dad and son
however if you want to get more than one post rather use functions mentioned above i think the most important thing is to grab them in one db query and not in ineffective way one-by-one
i think that the actual order is alphabetical max is lesser than min starting from spring 3.0.4
if you have nested data in your model this will soon get tricky to handle though and in that case a post is the better option
3 updates if required will be more challenging with avro thrift
a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable they do no more harm.
if you can predict more than one cron job to be executed you can try or any other library like this where you can config jobs scheduler in php
finally after figuring out what i needed was a page access token i gave up trying to do this client-side realising server-side makes more sense at least security wise
for the second test you should favor mockito over easymock that is more easy effective flexible and powerful to use
if you are uncertain you can always put an if statement and check if the number you get back is highter then int.maxvalue
for public inheritance it means that all the accessible members of base class that is the public and protected members can not be at a level more permissive than public
having getter and setter methods gives you more power as a developer over the class
what i would suggest is to make sure you are using visual studio 2010 sp1 then install iis express which is an upgrade to cassini and is much more like real iis and then switch your project to use iis express and see if you get the same exception
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss
i added my own implementation not because yours didn t work but to show how you could delegate responsibilities to classes which reflect the problem domain making the code a bit more readable though considerably longer with boilerplate getter and setter
because the uiview is smaller it is going to crop out the larger subviews
i ve tried a bunch of other things as well one of them being hook elements with insertafter but stay in parent - jquery which worked perfectly but if the position was higher than the children inside the parent it didn t know what to do with it and causing a lot of unwanted behavior
with firefox google-chrome and safari it s less of an issue because those started auto-updating years ago and more than two years ago they stopped blocking methods other than get and post
ok i am new to audio with unity but despite reading all the unity posts regarding audio adding 2 short .wav clips i heard wav was smaller than mp3 to my app has added over 200mb
for the most part i think the choice of snap vs yesod vs happstack is less an issue of features and more one of personal taste
here in your example col-md-4 class is been used that means if you will shrink your screens more than medium screens size ipad or tablet it will starts responsiveness
how could i turn this into an array easier than using explode substr explode
boost s io stream might be a better solution than stl s own stream
i get somehow category repeated if it has more than 1 post eg
technically you can do it dynamically but that would require doing the registration unregistration somewhere more permanent than onresume onpause which i don t think is really what you want.
mapr has clearly cheaper tco and technologically superior platform cloudera is a bit more polished hortonworks for pure open source don t read this as free or cheap as most companies end up spending more money on hw to get any value
obviously md5 is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will hash to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits
edit i found out that piston was proposing query throttling but everywhere people say that tastypie is better than piston
however there s one thing we haven t considered yet - what if you never get more than 5 post
in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app
for division things are a little more complicated than multiplication see
i have tested that by modifying one image in hdpi folder and keep it as it is in the xhdpi folder the result was note 1 is loading from the xhdpi folder am i missing something here it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi
but generally post is slower and would be bigger in size than a get request
i am using bottle but i am going to want to use https and support for https under flask seems much more straight forward
in my opinion the second way to achieve this is better because using get is not thats ecure in my opinion.it s easier than using post
in chrome when you use background-size cover if the xpos of background-image is no less than 50 you will meet that problem
the ogv version of the video seems to run a little better than the webm which itself seems to run better than the mp4
my problem is i m more familiar with mysql and could probably figure this out but this is postgresql and i am still getting tripped up on syntax
but the problem is that i need to terminate a process if it lasts more than a timeout 3 seconds
check out sorcery it s more lightweight and less obscure than devise
i think that in short the second answer to that question covers it all the heap constraint which is that children are greater than their parent does not completely specify the heap so there is usually more than one possible arrangement
right now oxygene is much better as it supports a broader set of language and platform features than delphi .net ever did
to allow you to scale down the data away from endpoints 0 and 1 i had to do this when combining colormap in matplotlib single pcolormesh with more than one colormap using matplotlib so you can likely see how the code works but basically say you have values -5 1 10 in a sample but want to normalize based on a range of -7 to 7 so anything above 7 our 10 is treated as a 7 effectively with a midpoint of 2 but shrink it to fit a 256 rgb colormap
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method
however cobertura looks more modern active last update from 2010 instead of 2005 and generates nicer reports so i would prefer it over emma
good advice but in the end i decided a bindable textblock was more useful and simpler than a richtextbox
tells us where the difference between min and max is less than 5 that is the forward relationship
the problem i have noticed is that sometimes the jquery post result is retrieved earlier than the load of the .js file has been completed so i get an error and of course the jquery plugin doesn t work
i feel like if the bitmap class makes data modifications to the stream then it would have to decompress the stream which should make the bitmap class take the same amount of memory working with bmp streams as when it works with png streams despite the fact that the png streams is smaller
if i don t use shiny every time i regenerate the plot on some kind of user-interaction the html file created by plotly dygraphs which is more than 1mb needs to be transferred to the client
i think that inventing something better than both ant and maven wouldn t be that difficult but that tool doesn t seem to exist yet
in a few more years there might be an architecture where 128bit math is faster than 64bit but i don t think any exists today
however i ve searched for a couple days and am not getting a definitive answer and i need a better understand of this so i know no better way to get more info than to post here
get is simpler and faster than post and can be used in most cases
personally i m using sublimetext right now which i find easier than vim for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste
or more ideally you might want to change show hide to jquery fadein fadeout which is more appropriate for back to top indicators
i am creating an commerce website and i am stuck in a database problem i am storing customer orders please tell me which is better myisam or innodb i have to use transaction like feature in customer order table and i personally prefer myisam because it is much faster than innodb and it also supports full-text searching is there any way to use transaction like rollback feature in myisam so that if anything goes wrong table will be rollback to its previous state how to do that without any external library or any other server side access and i have to use mysql
in other words hardly anything slower than multiplying add subtract but not enough to really worry about
the heap constraint which is that children are not greater than their parent does not completely specify the heap so there is usually more than one possible arrangement
click is tapestry-like but much more easy than tapestry and wicket
though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in google-chrome which is worse than extra space in firefox ie
i find that the swing library is easier to use than awt although you do still have to use awt for listeners
we thought of django but we think that is very big for our purpose and we decided that webpy or web2py is a better option
you ll hit problems with larger submissions and file-uploads as the size limit for a get is much smaller than a post
each page would have 2 actions a get that takes simple ids and a post which takes more complex models
this is slow because your hard disk is significantly slower than ram and at 7gb there will be a lot of data being read from your hard disk put into ram then moved back to your page file the file on disk your operating system uses to store data that has been copied out of ram
if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder
my questions are am i right to want to use json and use a php file on the remote server that will accept it as get or is post better and what issues should i be aware of when submitting this for review through itunes
first of all if your instagram client is in sandbox mode then you can t get more than 20 post more clearly last 20 post
e.g. break with labels as in java or even a more generic goto. continue does not seem more special than other control-structure mechanisms except that it is present in more languages
this is because the secondary sorting orders by id and if the parent id happens to be higher than any children the parent may not show up on top of the children
however if for example you have two parent sibling elements where one has a higher z-index than the other no descendant of the parent with the lower z-index will ever have a higher z-index than children of the parent with the higher z-index even if you set the former s children to z-index 500 or something like that
originally i was looking for a binary display but this hex display is much better for viewing
pull subscriptions perform much better than push subscriptions in a wan scenario
because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a handset there s more room to combine and interchange ui components
while i think gbn s answer is probably sufficient i m wondering whether use of an over clause to establish a max date per id attribute with which to reduce the select in a where clause wouldn t be faster than a rank
the result you are getting is also a valid heap - each parent is bigger than its children
having looked at the existing accesses listed i can see that it doesn t appear to be using the salt md5 hash that s stated in the apache docs the hash password that s stored is different to what i m thinking i should expect the salt is significantly more than 2 characters and for security reasons i m reluctant to embed a particular password hashing algorithm in my code
sometimes mri is faster but with the right parameters and warmup jruby was 3 to 3.5 times as fast on my system for this particular
more than that filtering and sorting by one or more of the attributes will send me to the world of hurt
apple seems to claim that the optional type in swift is safer than nil in objective-c but i don t understand why this is so
note extends mouseadapter is easier since you only need to implements the methods you want to handle
you can check this article of mine if you want something more than simply hide show elements this is how to have simulated conditional fields in cf7 with jquery
get requests have smaller limits than post in the specs
though it s unrelated to your actual question des is generally slower than aes at least in software so unless you really need to keep the key small aes is almost certainly a better choice
now in .net for desktop controls you can use inherited which is much more powerful than the old tag properties anyway
or will every commit pull push takes a longer time as changetsets count increase
the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse
coalesce does the same thing here as nvl but is more portable
turning comment to answer i suggest you add error checking to all your system and standard library calls except printing to stdout stderr that s more clutter than it s worth for almost any app something like
as a general rule of thumb at least in security you should trust no user so i think it would be the wise choice to validate the data client-side it s also faster and then if the first validation passed validate it server-side to double-check or to have a safety net if the user has javascript turned off something you don t see that often
i have a directory containing more than 1000 folder
there are definitely some advantages using external editors however emacs is ten million times better than vim
bazaar seems much more like svn with branches just being separate directories so maybe not
i have a directory which has more than 10 folder
reason i once heard that protected is better for hibernate performance but all i can find on the web is hibernate can access public private and protected accessor methods as well as public private and protected fields directly
i find request + cheerio to be easier than jsdom for tasks like this
also if this controller is an hid the hidapi library might be a better fit than libusb
by wrapping the - in spaces the delimiter is less likely to be tripped up and there s no need to trim the result
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots
the second table has children linked to their parent passport id i only take in account one parent -either father mother- per family
but actually break has more resemblance to return both instructions jump out of a block of code which is pretty much structured in comparison to goto
so if more than 2 checkbox are selected then a button named group appears
change it to public to make it more accessible or perhaps better protected to make it less accessible than public but more than private read more about that here
as a result of this comparison i see that lasagne is performing so much worse than keras that i m starting to doubt about my code
most likely for the same reason that implements idisposable but ienumerator does not--the earlier version was written before the authors thought of circumstances where one an a implementation might need cleanup but a factory returning such an implementation might not know about such need
note that while you could use purrr for the job it s not particularly better suited than regular dplyr
i believe lodash is a better choice over underscore.js more details in this blog post
note that i do not want to bind a gridview directly to the view property from a resourcedictionary where the datatemplates x shared attribute is set to false as this leads to problems in the xaml designer view can t be shared by more than one listview
so once more the chances of generating a min value that is exactly 10 less than the max value are so low that the test will give up trying to find values that satisfy this condition
also even without using the shift key when typing quickly i often find i haven t quite released a key before typing the next letter so i get more than one keydown event in a row before the corresponding keyup events - this has no noticeable bad effect in normal circumstances but is noticeable when there s code responding to both the down and up events
in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up
if you look how floating point numbers are implemented they can t represent all numbers between their max and min as the number of real numbers in a range is bigger than infinite
because you can guess the top passwords and see if they have the same hash but the author points out that hmac is a more secure mechanism
instead you use other lifecycle methods that are more appropriate such as onstart which will be called both after oncreate when the activity is first created and when the activity is returning to the foreground from having been in the background
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method
in short - if all we care about are comparisons heapsort is a better choice than quicksort
i have been toying with opengl for about 2 weeks creating hardcoded vbos and making rotating triangles but the question that has been lingering in my head is how the heck do i create more than one vbo vao in real-time so i can handle multiple objects
start with the number you want to reach and if it s divisible by 5 then divide by 5 because multiplication by 5 results in a shorter solution than addition by 3
you can select min if you want or you could limit your allpossibleids to be less than the max table id
so a g1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screens but this is a very small difference so it s not a big deal
usually though post request are intended to be used for changing the state of the resource on the server so if the only thing you have to do is retrieving data a get is more appropriate
i have a label with a single character that i wish to be bigger than the uiview that it s a subviews of
the trouble is the game runs fullscreen in 800x600 resolution and really doesn t like being minimized which makes it more or less impossible to actually use ida while the game is running
another thing to try is the excellent entity framework profiling - has saved us many headaches in debugging performance issues like these - gives you a lot more than sql profiling and you can see what queries objects are created per objectcontext and method source line etc -
the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes
make sure you have enough ram so that your data set fits with ram atleast your index should fit inside the ram coz each time a data fetched from disk is 10 times slower than ram
the bad we use a break that is little more than a tamed goto something like goto the end of the loop
it sounds like you need a treemap which has iteration which is not much slower than linkedhashmap and does what you really want
if i now change max to be greater than min the min textbox validation state does not get cleared down presumably because min hasn t changed and therefore doesn t get validated again
if you are using any js loops then for each loops is slower than normal for-loop you might wanna take a look at this
this blog post is more detailed but unfortunately does also not mention where to get the product key
not sure about the overhead of calling gethashcode a few million times but comparing two ints is probably going to be a lot quicker than the equals object method
use post its safer than get if you use rest
post has worse performance than get
so using regular width and height properties is currently more reliable and they have the same values as long as their values have not been changed explicitly before
either way i intend to use smarty partly because i have lots of experience with it and partly because its much more well documented and has much more functionality than blade and to me the syntax is slightly cleaner than twig although the template engine is not the point of this question really
actionscript is quicker than mxml but for what you re going to do you re trading speed for convenience - mxml comes with all the different ui classes list scrollbars etc already there
getting the width and height takes more work than it s worth especially trying to do it across all devices and a responsive framework gives you so many more options
is post safer than get
when working in bash it is generally more efficient and better suited to use the tools that bash provides rather than spawning subshell calling 3rd party tools like grep and cut
when i draw a 3d cube in opengl es for android it seems to look fine as long as i m in portrait mode but when i switch to landscape it looks more like a diamond
for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined
first get unitythread class from this post which makes it easier to call a function on the main thread from another thread
for the sake of completeness i d like to add that using getter setter consistently makes it easier to override a class
note that mongoose-auth is built on everyauth and they will work fine but i like the flexibility of the strategies concept from passport and the express integration is better
you could of course just wrap the function in a decltype to figure out the return but an auto is much cleaner to write
i suppose it is because you hide them faster than you show them so for a slight second the overal page height is shorter than it should
after reading some related articles i don t think swift is more effective than objective-c
the unfortunate side effect is that half your circle will be cut off as it extends into the range that is less than your minimum value
do you keep the parent if they are better than the children
note you are using a post method but a get method seems more appropriate in your case getvotes
dbcontext is newer api which should polish developers experience when using most common tasks - simply the api is better designed but you still have to get objectcontext from dbcontext and use the older api if you want to use some more complex features
among other things the apple template code will include creation of a glkbaseeffect which provides some shader functionality that seems to be required in order to be able to draw with opengl-es 2.0
by setting the move distance to 4000 i am basically saying if your drag is less than 4000 treat it as a click
so as you can see the random binary search tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists
of course uiscrollview can have more than one content view just as any uiview can have more than one subviews and this case it will be more difficult to render its layer
as the comments already mention if you are starting out with version control you would be well advised to choose a newer system than rcs git mercurial fossil subversion ...
use swing follow the threading rules which are hardly likely to be more onerous than awt and enjoy
while it would be highly unfeasible to create a test that would exercise every possible code path in tpl you can certainly setup a test that would benefit from many available cores set the affinity mask to 1 cpu and observe through task manager that the affinity never changes and cpu utilization is never more than 1 n where n is the # of cores present
if your client jar is really thinner for example only the interfaces having the war s reference the client jar effectively disallows them to access to ejb implementations which is always a good idea
why is the parent smaller than the children on narrow screens
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server
so i ve come up with a way to center children in a parent that is smaller than itself
yes they are different but you can hardly say that the vb.net version is less capable than the vb6 version
there are 9 buttons at present and i want to add some more buttons with same height and width and margins which can be shown below these 9 buttons by scroll view.i will be thankful if you people can help me in fixing these problem
not really any more than safari having cookies and firefox having cookies are somehow tied
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it
it s not perfect but i guess that a protected method that does not check parameters is better than a public method that does not do it
and if somebody is running a 6-month old versioning with a known bug upgrade becomes a more acceptable answer if they are 12 versioning behind
one reason post is worse for security is that get is logged by default parameters and all data is almost universally logged by your webserver
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time
you d be doing this much easier with domdocument and domxpath instead which works as you d expect
template engines are rarely the cause of performance problems even if chameleon is slightly faster than jinja2 i doubt the effort of learning a new template language etc
the reason why the vpn is slow is well because your vpn is likely 50 to 100 times slower than your lan local area network
i am currently writing a server for a fast paced multiplayer game which should be run in udp i read tcp was inappropriate due to the way it handles packet drops in applications requiring timely delivered data please correct me if tcp is more useful the game is not mass multiplayer and should be hosted primarily by the players themselves probably on local dedicated servers
since perforce is less commonly used compared to cvs svn amongst bamboo users we generally get less feedback about it and hear less about existing issues
note my use of a foreach loops here which is much neater than your for-loop for this kind of thing
i wrote this function and it seemed okey but it fails if there are more than one folder in the current directory and no files
in other words if a parent row can have more than one children when sending the fields to each child the parent data will be duplicated in each children
if your form is meant to create modify data you ll use post instead of get but get is easier to test
it s just a hunch but maybe it s only a matter of the size of your draggable being too big and being over more than one droppable item
it looks like the parent will become a zombie too if children aren t handled and a child runs longer than the parent
however since i know that the add-in is more or less working as is for all users some of whom use excel 2010 and some of whom use excel 2013 and some of whom may explicitly have vsto installed and some of whom may not i d like to be sure that i m not setting myself up for a bruising later on when some features of the add-in stop working for no apparent reason due to changing the setting
but i think importing the text file into excel delimiter by spaces is quicker if this can be done
you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce
i know that in practice this would only happen with a great amount of connection given that processing time of an udp connection is faster than tcp but it could potentially happen
if you want to cover a brownfield project with tests which was not written at all with testability in mind then you have to use one of typemock or moles in my opinion typemock is the better choice
the post at has more information on how to get that access token
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above
for anyone curious about the coalesce vs isnull discussion and why i changed my answer to use isnull kanav rightly pointed out that coalesce is more expensive
you can find more information by amazon here link an alexa user with a user in your system
any ideas what might be causing this how i could fix it or how i could get around it to use matshow or imshow on a specified subplot the end use case is to have more than 1 subplot in the figure
if anyone has some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf
i have tested on mp3 files in different directory it takes less than one second with over 6000 files stored in different folder
i think whoever said post is better than get when using passwords meant that the passwords would be part of the url in the get request which would obviously be bad
tortoise now has an option push new branch that may be safer than force pull or push
ubuntu is far less conservative than debian so you will get closer to the bleeding edge
due to this i create a temporary directory and use createfromdirectory but i don t want copy the same folder to other location in the disk almost the zipped already folder is better
i would say that probably yes as long as we have enough of ram which is faster that virtual memory in case we need to access something from the disk which is extremely slow... but also i know that some applications just require having paging
here s something that should get you started - this is all based on the assumption that there are only 3 checkboxes on your whole page and that you re interested in all of them - you ll want to make a method like this respond to your checkbox elements onclick events - i ve found that to be more reliable than onchange
here i am retriving data from database and i am doing insert update and delete of data using checkbox.my problem is when i click more than two checkbox than also i am moving to update.php page but what i actually want is that when i click on update button first it will check that only one checkbox is selected from list if not than alert message should display like select only one checkbox
anyway http 405 is telling you that your backend does not support the put method and probably it s expecting a post method with the x-http-method-override put http header since post is more standard method in rest than put
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time
people typically find jax-rs easier to start with and the more modern approach although jax-ws has more build-in type-safety features which is also exactly where most of its complexity comes from
and as bonus on google-chrome firefox is better in this case user will never be able to type any accents on the current page in any inputs without reloading the window
if the processors is loaded enough then my thread works fine but when the processors is more or less free i rich quickly my cpu limitation 50 and finally the pool terminates and needs to be recycled
i had read through hundreds of docs and forum posts regarding whether innodb or myisam is the better engine to use most sources giving vague evaluations or at best overly complicated benchmarking with vague settings claiming to increase or even decrease.
still technically yes it appears that an all swift solution is roughly 2x slower than a swift + cocoa solution which should be roughly the same than objective-c + cocoa when compiled with equivalent options iirc
so i will start with commit 1 find all the parent ie commit 2 and try to check if there is an branch for this commit ie number of children is more than 1
maven usage is lower compared to ant but just how much lower is not really known
i don t think you can do what you want with pure css as you will need to make a calculation to see if the images height is less than the width
mycroft ai seems to have a nice stack of projects that offer functionality and programmer interface very similar to amazon alexa custom skills and you can host and modify it yourself to get more flexibility than alexa voice service but that s also a bit of a downside because you have to scale it yourself
calculates the size of the first 5 folder in your home dir should work on all platforms fails with an arrayindexoutofboundexception if there are less than five folder in your home dir
svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features
with perfect forwarding and decltype auto overloading becomes alot easier but still will take time to implement and would have to be modified if ever another function was added
i ve just timed this and it is about 25 faster than using sin and cos
the theory is that someone extending your class with protected access knows more about what they are doing than someone who is merely using it with public access
just like an mp3 or something wav is probably faster
so what i want is if the list is less than 99 hide something else if the list is more than 100 then show something this is what i placed under ajax success handler
i ve heard that for example short can use much less numbers than int however its advantage is that it uses much less memory is there something similar with chars and string
i created the exact same network with native and backend tensorflow but after many hours of testing using number of different parameters still couldn t figure out why keras outperforms the native tensorflow and produces better slightly but better results
essentially all rsa implementations for about 30 years do not simply do c up d mod n as shown in the first few paragraphs of wikipedia or billions of blogs copied from brief news clippings or exceprts from decades ago but instead use a more complicated private-key that supports the more efficient chinese remainder theorem computation as explained if you read all of the wikipedia article or look at a text by an author who actually knows about modern cryptography
but if i switching to my 24 monitor there is no longer this problem since the screens is wider and therefore the table rows are wider too
in terms of pure speed it is not always the case that myisam is faster than innodb but in my experience it tends to be faster for pure read working environments by a factor of about 2.0-2.5 times
you can also use underscore.js but lodash is faster more complete and you can create custom build with only what you need
unless you re writing trivial apps or just like re-writing code i wouldn t start any new project in codeigniter because pyrocms is the more sensible starting point
get method is used for illustration here you may find that post makes more sense for this operation
this was certainly true 40 years ago when it was first developed but i believe in more modern processors the difference between add and multiplying has gotten smaller
you ll need more n as max w min w increases but even drawing a ten million samples is fast on a modern machine
a lot of answers comments are mentioning that the background-color rgba is faster and more efficient but that background-image is more compatibility friendly
malloc often gives you more memory that you ask and stores the actual value in a special location that realloc can access at a later time
for example if you tried that and it only installed newer files with higher versioning then your major upgrade logic is incorrect by definition because that will uninstall the older product before installing the newer one
you should definitely pick mp3 because they are about 10x smaller than wav files of the same duration
lemmatization is relatively more complicated as compare to stemming that is why it s harder to find some ready and free solution
you can use datediff between the column date and your current date and retrieve only the lines where the difference is less than 7 like
modulo gives you a remainder which is why it s better than straight division in situations where you re number of elements can change
but i ve found that sublimetext 2 has some features i like more than textmate and also tm v2 which is in beta
i want to set limits to the picker such that the max date is today s date and the minimum date is not more than one year ago
if you re using retrofit and okhttp to perform the network calls i suggest you use moshi as it s also from square and claimed to work faster and better than gson
i d have to say i d personally go for either prestashop or cscart as they do have a lot more features than opencart and at the same time also don t cost anywhere near magento to setup and run
the naming of parent and child classes sometimes is counter intuitive as we often think as children as being smaller than the parent but in programming the child is the same as the parent but with extra funtionality
iâ ve read a so questionâ s comment where inserting order# 68 as pictured wouldnâ t cause any trouble but if i wanted to query orders by certain tags a many-to-many is more appropriate convenient efficient since otherwise in a one-to-many every single order will have to be checked to know how its tags is this true
do your post put probably is more appropriate here upon leaving the input field
what i have understood is that declarative let you do whatever you want as long as the result passes and imperative is more verbose
we all know that the access to ram memory is faster than access to hard disk
if however in your app you can ensure that the tab is active while listening then settimeout or setinterval is better as it can fire as often as 100 times per second
there is a parent table he can add more than one children email ids no
i used the addclass and removeclass is a more elegant way of doing this
get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post so suitable checks for existance and ownership of the record would be important
i don t know anything about except that it s more powerful than gedit but doesn t have the same feel as vim emacs
for browsers that don t support either event you can fall back to onkeydown with a 0ms timer for the check which is a little better than onkeyup
you could do this in matplotlib probably using patch objects to build up a cube and colour the patches as needed however for 3d plotting mayavi is generally easier better
so when you go up an arrays 0-9 you want the top of a for-loop to be less than the arrays length when you are going down the arrays 9-0 you want the lower bound to be less than or equal to the bottom of the arrays otherwise you will start out trying to access at 10 the arrays length and get an outofrangeexception
adb is more reliable since you get the feedback immediately unlike monkeyrunner which does not provide reliable exceptions in case of any failure in triggering the event
i ve used tcpdf in the past and found it a lot better than fpdf
choose the correct type of image extension sometimes gif or png delivers better results then jpg s
however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008
so only letting what are used for other classes and objects nothing more than that public for those where other classes would use too protected for those limit only for extending classes
there are many options for you like visser suggested you could convert the date time into a long int which allows faster computation or you can keep them as strings or even convert them into chars like what you have done with chars array2
i have makefile .mke on windows and i need to count directory in a folder which start with install and then make if clause to throw an exception if there are more than one directory like this
i like to use closest and find more than parent and children respectively
put does not mean update any more than post means insert
first bit banging i2c is way more complicated than bit banging spi
also onchange won t work you ll need to use onkeyup although onblur is probably more sane
code looks correct and even at its worst jackson should be no slower than gson
these locations will convert when they go to windows 7 perhaps or because the application they use internally is upgrade and needs the newer browser versioning
one more thing some guys would misunderstand that post is safer than get as user can not see the sent data
post is usually intended for creating content put is more modifications
you could instead check say with if feof stream to see if you are at eof but i think just checking the return value of fgetc is nicer
but a friend told me to begin with flask as it s simpler and will help me when i start learning django as django is more complicated than flask
if your table represents id_1 is a parent of id_2 then both a parent can have many children and children can have more than one parent this is known as a many-to-many relationship
inside the container i have a panel with the text set to left but when the screens gets smaller then a tablet to something like a phone i want the text in the panel to center
in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that
regarding skinning i feel trinidad default skinning to be more basic than richfaces one but i think both have ways to make them as beautiful as your css skills allow you
after android l developer preview published google supply a new view called recyclerview which can replace listview and gridview it makes it easier to make a horizontal list so i update my answer here
i want to implement a functionality on gmap api that if the zoom is more than 17 show all the markers otherwise just hide them
most pages for this exception i found with google talk about overloaded methods setter which is not the case with my dtos - they re simple objects with nothing more than properties setter and getter
in other words guard is more a generic framework for every process which needs to do something triggered by a file change autotest is restricted to running tests
this only happens when the window is on a computer in full screens mode but when the screens is made smaller to a phone tablet size the divs function how they should
i also read somewhere that uicollectionview has much better performance in displaying variable-sized content would it be worthwhile possible to try configuring a uicollectionview to display the messages and somehow make it look like a uitableview
in addition to avoiding peculiar upgrade issues when moving to a new edition and a new versioning unless you don t really mean express is sql server 2008 you also have the added bonus that you still have your original databases intact which you won t have if the upgrade fails in worse ways than simply being blocked
the last bit is there because i needed to limit the time selected to no earlier than the min date and no greater than the max date so i had to check the date selected in the matching datepicker control
this is well within disk space but far larger than ram
as you can easily understand max have to be greater than min
i would recommend cocos2d-x as it is in my opinion equally or even better than corona and it is free
in other words the operating system is using some of your hard disk space to satisfy your 13 mb allocation request at great expense of speed since the hard disk is much much slower than ram
i am new at a firm and i was given a project that was on amazon linux ami now we need to transfer project on another server and because i am more familiar with ubuntu than with amazon linux ami i was wondering if there much difference and will project work perfectly
call to instagram on success of which you call fotogram to initialize your slider but the problem is that since you re loading many images fotorama initialization gets run more than once on each success .after first initialization any further attempt would only mess up the slider.note that if you put it outside 2 foreach that wouldn t work either because at this point even the first request would be in pending state
as soon as you go beyond single processors it s much more effective to add another cpu or two to system than to struggle with gpu calculations
somewhat good news you could move to tcpdf which is much better at handling utf8 and is more modern in general than fpdf
jackson type safety is way better than gson
unless the rounding goes the other way in which case your grandchild has less width and or your parent has less room to hold its children
i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill
what if a parent has more than 100 children
strange bitshifting code implementing multiplication or division is far less expressive of what you were conceptually trying to achieve so other developers will be confused by that and a confused programmer s more likely to introduce bugs or remove something essential in an effort to restore seeming sanity
edit2 okay i just see that if the angle is bigger than 180â it s concave so i have to change the shape for be simple than a triangulation
if you are changing a few keys in a large dictionary it is more efficient to use dictionary set dictionary unset as described earlier dictionary map is optimized for the case where a lot of changes are being made
i think what s written within your for-loop while loops is of greater importance of what s affecting your running time
so my question is how to move this database into ram where i can access it via sqlite3_open or if my idea is bullshit and leaving the database on disk is faster than moving it into ram via mapping
ps i m not set on swt if anybody thinks a different library technology such as swing awt is better
qmainwindow is basically same as qwidget when used as a guess what main window the noticeable difference is that qwidget expects you to have only 1 window in ur application while qmainwindow is more about serving as the most important window which will control all the rest like alert message boxes for example
with parent child groups how do i only trigger the main page with image to break on the parent when any of the children items is greater than 9
now i want to convince it by using apt-pinning and not hold to keep the local package if the versioning is the same and try to upgrade only if the remote versioning is newer
in other words instead of mis-using stderr like this - look into ways to gain more control over stdout
shifting bits left and right is apparently faster than multiplication and division operations on most maybe even all cpus if you happen to be using a power of 2
the content of the text is set from an rss feed that is usually longer that that can be displayed in the text box
also if you notice i ve changed the keyup event to keydown which is better in my opinion cause when the user holds their finger down on a button the code wouldn t be fired if it is on the keyup event
what is the established way to pass some data â more than int boolean string because those can be handled as marker attributes â from the class that creates an imarker to an imarkerresolution so that the quick fix can be smart about what it displays does
the mouseenter event is usually a better choice than mouseover
another project you might want to look at is cassette which pretty much does everything squishit does and more
to get your code to run more than once put it in a while loop
koa doesn t provide this kind of thing out of the box - it s designed to be a little more low level than express
finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility
if you are sure that a floating point multiplication is better than a floating point division then
you could try something like this so that it checks to make sure that your y does not go greater than or less than max min y
the downsides are that it is unreliable messages can be dropped or corrupted therefore you may want to add some safety and that some isp may restrict udp more than tcp test yourself to be sure but usually there is no problems
please someone tell me that there is an better way than creating setter and getter for every bit field in my project
post get method doesn t have the same lenght limit you can use post to send more data than with get
but i don t want to put a margin on every 2nd item because when the browser width becomes smaller there will be 2 or even 1 items in a row
i was always taught that division is slower than multiplication but i have no real proof of thisâ has anyone got an opinion on this before i start benchmarking and running test
swift won t allow you to do absolutely everything that objective-c does but it will allow you to do almost everything and the code will be probably more robust considering that swift is more modern language with stronger typing than objective-c
short answer dijkstra s is your best bet if you want just a few shortest paths and the floyd-warshall algorithm is better if you want to find the shortest paths between every pair of nodes
but honestly cron is fairly lightweight and unless it needs to be real-time or whatever that means to you writing php into a daemon is more work than it s work
the screens is much smaller so you can not present your app the same way as you can on a tablet
restructuring of the database to just add an salt field is better option or the only one really if your going to do it properly but you could use your currant hash field to store the salt as other person posted
i don t know how it works but it s much more complex than addition subtraction or even multiplication
splinter makes it easier to use selenium plus
i suggest you starting with memset instead though since memcpy is much more complicated than you might think
ati might be a better between nvidia and ati since it was reportedly faster in 2009 but i m not sure if those stats are still correct
1 reading other questions about the rest method for this proposes i think that i should use get better than post
gmagick is newer version of imagick with more set of features it is less resource intensive and fast but the problem is there is very few discussion about this wonderful tool on web i recently came across this on
also i advise you to take a look at javascript s setinterval since it is more appropriate than settimeout for what you want to do
for example if i click the smaller tabitem the tabcontrol becomes smaller and if i select the bigger one it becomes bigger
obviously i want in portrait view the content area of this iframe to be smaller than in landscape
but the only thing i get is that the activity is still in landscape but the rectangle now is smaller with the portrait dimensions and the camera becomes weird because the image is rotated 90 degrees and moves down when i move the phone left and up when moving the phone right
swift is clearer on versions releases and i keep asking myself if i am missing something related to objective-c since i can t find this information
if so this should work and it should also be a lot quicker than using modulo and division
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is
i thought i could somehow i am totally fresh iterate trough the folder which exists in one folder will all this other folder and check if the dir contains more than one file if not rmdir foldername
it would probably make more sens with a chars instead of an int so you could just do case c case i
i have a select2 input box for multiselet option in which user can select as many options as he wants if the selected options are occupying more space than available width then i wanted to increase the height of the select box automatically don t want scroll option all options should be in viewable space and get the remaining options in next line
the more randomness and more characters your salt has the better for the hash but anything that s several characters long and random works
however a ram disk is easier to work with
i ve used both robospice is more robust but ion is easier on the eyes
i see ones i merge master to feature branch i can not squash he commits any more using interactive rebase
further to this i m still opting for scoreloop and i can confirm this behaves the same regarding one score per user but it offers a lot more functionality and does seem to respond much quicker than openfeint did for me
i m trying to stop dragging the children div when his position is equal or higher than the parent position
additional options are to show this via a timeout so it s only shown when the post takes more than a short time and to use some form of fadein not sure if possible with a dialog then you don t get the annoying flash on the times it s very quick
svn works much better when disconnected from the network - with perforce you have to tell the server when you ve done a checkout
you would think that you could simply increment each element s z-index by two but that does not work due to the fact that children elements cannot have a higher z-index than their parent if the parent s z-index is set
i ve heard that noexcept keyword is more like it should never throw an exception rather than it doesn t
if the actual size of the parent s list of children is less than the parent s expected number of children originally read from the file push the parent back onto the stack
nowadays however the rationale behind the sealed modifiers is far more about design choices controlling how client code interacts with your library
is there any way of better dealing with large rss feed
when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly
gson is very easy to use while jackson has better performance
by giving .artist-container a higher z-index you are placing it higher in the stacking order than the child image though children always have a higher z-index than their parent
to get the same difference with two different numbers one of them has to be either less than the minimum or more than the maximum of the initial range which is contradictory
if i do it with a simple for-loop i will get an error because loops is done faster then the sensors are changed
i m developing with canvas too and have found that webkit based browsers in general handle canvas operations quicker than gecko in most cases
as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram this problem can grind the machine down to a practical halt
if you need more than a simple method call you could just as well create a more elaborate clicklistener implementation that has more than the buttonclick method
get is always faster than post
http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server
a little more pull than push style that s because there is no duplicate item.
i m sure you could do something with auto-layout but when you have a view that has subviews that need to be positioned within it subclassing uiview is a better way to go in my opinion
at any rate disk speeds are orders of magnitude lower than the ram speed and i wouldn t be too much concerned about the mode here unless of course it turns out that caching is different in the two modes
most likely it ll still be tightly linked with implementations generally a bad thing or if not bad it s not especially good but i think a structure like this is better than a superclass figuring out what all of its subclassing are
another camera that i am thinking to use is the asus movement sensor but i dont know if this is better than kinect more options i know that both uses openni or if both are the same
in maven you can define a.k.a testing.staging live etc which allow you to configure settings for different environments.all you need to specify maven about the environment for which you want the things to move and maven is capable enough to take care of this.though this can be done with ant also but i believe that maven provides more flexibility
and how to make that the salary max is never less than the salary min that a user entered
but i believe sending data using curl with post method is better than get method
if i need to display one 1 friends post i can do this simply but when there are couple of friends with more than 1 post i can t get the name and picurl of the user and it displays null in json response
i ve taken the example of two linefeed here but the same is true for any character string i could subvert the problem by maybe taking a longer string as the delimiter but that would have two undersirable effects
imho - if breaking up my components to parent children means less testability - then something is wrong with this framework
when you press print in calendar print preview the print dialog that pop-up has more options cross browsers
servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t
because this is a salt hash it s even more difficult
owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone
i have been searching on the net and i made a couple of examples of both of them but i m even more confused because in some sample web pages mvp uses more than 2 interfaces to communicate the presenter with the view layer some ones even have completely blank interfaces only declarated but in other ones it only takes two interfaces to transport data from presenter to view
on post and put it is always better to return the modified resource including its id
2 as mentioned by mike brent get is wide open to easy and simple abuses but while his recommendation of post is better it s still open to abuse unless appropriate measures are taken see 3 below
in contrast to jenkins teamcity produces much more detailed reports and provides the ability to track the history of a test- how often does it get broken etc. suspend tests .
you can actually switch to strtod always a much better idea than atof and ask it to give you the character position that caused it to stop parsing
here i don t like that the body of the post request contains more different fields then the body returned from the get request - but maybe this is not a problem
the key question was related to what kind of situations would udp be the better choice over tcp
it was the first framework in python i ever used but it was really simple to use really no more than flask or bottle
zim s advice is excellent and searching on int will always be faster than chars
you can use get or post both but in my opinion post is better way here
although this problem sort of yells delegate it s much easier with subclassing since you intend to inherited almost all the same functionality
also please suggest me an open source json binder better than gson could be jackson json genson or if any other which could help me to develop fully fledged application in which application continuously hit to restful services and receives the response from the same
if width is larger than height you get undefined behaviour probably writing into random memory under which anything can happen
biggest of all is that adding new features to your vb6 application is more expensive than it would be if the application was in a better language like c# or vb.net
i m using keep-alive so i think the ssl handshake is more or less totally out but i hope to move to spdy soon so i don t really know how that helps after the initial handshake
thus after the loop exits you will be able to tell whether the values of min and max are real or just the initial values that haven t been changed another way to do that would be to test after the loop whether min is bigger than max - if it is then the file was empty
in my opinion calling getter and setter is slower than direct access to a field
as stated by other answers neither push nor pull is better but rather you should pick the one that best fits your design needs
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it
actually for min max it is easier to use which also supports handles lifted operators etc
if you want to be more secure you can send the sms s more often however there is a way to understand sim-card change this is for t-mobile and europe use i guess from within the app so that the user cant fool you by enetering sms for a different msisdn and then change to his her real msisdn sim card
bottom line i would personally hesitate to draw any simple conclusions of swift is faster than objective-c or vice versa
the downside is that you are losing the big part of the flyway s appeal in its simplicity and technically could be better off by using liquibase s dsl
i would suggest furthering your knowledge of python it s an amazing language so it s gonna be fun and then go back to django or maybe start with a smaller framework like flask which does less magic
you don t need regular expressions at all you could use explode substr is probably better but i want to show another alternative
in my experience normal execution on iphone is much faster than profiling with instrumentation
it seems possible to have adfs as the ip-sts send an assertion to more than 1 acs url based upon the acs url or acs index in the authnrequest as long as they are listed in the relaying party trust endpoints list
i think that instead of a for-loop is better a while because when you find your item can break loops
are there some solutions available to extends asp.net identity better than implements a custom solution as suggested in the links
it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing
as image shows below i want to make next button enabled only if more than one checkbox get checked
if still not then think of it as a min heap represented in array guarantees that parent is smaller than its child but says nothing about are all children arranged in sorted order left to right
we started experimenting with hapijs on smaller services and kind of like it more than express
buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk
it s possible though that software could mess things up by making subtraction slower than addition - but that s unlikely
i tried this code with my the big arrays it is around 10 to 20 times faster than a for-loop solution and around 200 times fast than the old code
but we can assume that generics in objective-c were introduced for transitioning to swift and in that regard using swift directly is even better
if there s any heavy application logic as opposed to all of the work being networking files database ironpython is much faster than cpython at a few things and much slower at a few others so you probably need to profile and perf-test before you go too far down either path
get method is not safer than post data never trust datas coming from the client side
of course you can only debugging the code to see the generated sql but it s easier with a profiling tool and you ll see how long time the query takes
the layout s height is less than the height of everything else and the width of the layout is the same as everything else but when i use layout.getheight and layout.getwidth in my onresume they always return 0 so i can t really use that
you have mentioned that we can t use actions more than get post put delete which is not true
but on the comparatively rare occasions where it happens it ll be a lot easier with the getter setter in place
if you date range is larger than the two years displayed just drag the formulas down to expand the max range
is it possible to use the same vbo with more than one vao like this
put a group of controls for which you would later call findsize ... under the same parent a panel for example or a groupbox whichever makes more sense to you
in my experience btrace overhead is far less noticeable than any profiler depending on activity of course - if you want to trace execution of all methods this will be expensive no matter what
most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie firefox are being a bit more forgiving than google-chrome is
while the differences may seem insignificant at first the correct usage of radio button and checkbox creates a better user experience because the site behaves in a way they expect
maybe one of you guys already sees a problem in the code snippets or have any other suggestion or hint for me why my udp transmission is slower than tcp
i don t want to use the get request since it says in the guidelines of a restful api that it should use post for this purpose plus i might want to send more data than get can handle
but in normal case it takes n 2 comparison so you half the height of tree but you multiplying each merge with two so total running time is not better than division to 2 part
side note if you are attempting to create a new customer you may want to use post instead as it may be considered more restful as put s are generally for updating an existing resource but this is up to you
edit i guess release is much faster than debugging but why is this profiling so time consuming
personally i prefer objective-c because you can use c very easily as anything that is legal in c is also legal in objective-c added to which swift is a more procedural in style where objective-c is quite clearly object orientated
at this point there is nothing i can do since the switching is no longer there... the external screens is just a blank screens for the sake of the exercise
i sure would like to use uwsgi as it is an ambitious project but at the end of the day i am a developer and not a sys admin and gunicorn is much easier to just get working in the common use cases
even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap
because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a
if i apply a negative margin to it that is greater than its height the first time feedbackview.showtext is called it doesn t animate in correctly
using signalr is not a good idea because signalr using push mechanism to notify but it seems in your case some pull method is more suitable and also signalr doesn t support really permanent queue to keep messages in queue while consumers being ready
postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions
should i just look for more than one cpu core and how do i detect that or maybe the processors speed or total system memory
i ve seen questions like this come up before and the general consensus is that jackson is much faster than gson
however there are many others ts xts which is generally faster than zoo .
still not managed yet to detect orientation correctly because now for some reason when portrait - width is still higher than height with is 960 at least that what javascript see but in reality it is not going over boundaries which are 768px
i don t know why this works i can only assume that httplib is slightly better behaved than urllib
that s one reason why omitting distinct and replacing union by union all is much faster
both children are greater than the parent
looks like you ll need to use int or double whichever makes more sense for your data are you using whole or floating-point numbers
not show from start is better than show and then hide
one more thing i also want select only one radio button when i have selected more than 2 checkbox
if you intend manual config it s probably better to choose something else for example ini
if the amount of ram is less you ll have a lot of swapping to disk which is a lot more time consuming
trust me i did this before for another job where the system architect decided that maven was better than ant and all of our projects must be converted from ant to maven
but i read in this post that group by on union are not possible yet it mean that cypher is less powerful than gremlin
kerberos is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site
edit as willeke has pointed out accessing a properties directly is technically faster than doing so via an accessor via self
no - icomparable is for seeing if one object is greater than equals to or less than another
on the other hand if what you want to do is not rounding but elimination of fractions into one direction then you have std ceil that goes always higher and std floor that always goes lower
but if you simply want to feed some content that will be displayed through its parent render method then using the children is more appropriate
i need to find out that how much division operation is faster than addition operation in a gpu
the first option is easy with one directory but becomes much more tedious with multiple folder not to mention that windows will likely create an object in the target directory before it has finished copying and i am compressing files potentially over 10 gb so that solution won t work
if i is rather little just iterate and keep i minimum datas insert every new data in a binary tree of the i most little datas if it is less than the max of these datas
i subscribed to the main canvas sizechanged event and applied a scale transform so that the canvas and its children would shrink and grow in a zoom like fashion when the control is resized which is working but for some reason the parent canvas is shrinking at a much higher rate than the children making the children fall off of the canvas at a certain point because of the scale rate
as already mentioned by others better to use swing over awt since swing is more advanced
my view is that if in some cases objective-c is faster than swift it doesn t mean that all over performance of swift is slower
from the count you will get the number of sequence and those which have more than 2 put those in a different series and then add that series in the dataframe
also with this method you could use different container for different dimensions like if you need one dimension to be sorted use qmap which is sorted by key for that and qhash which is more efficient for the dimension which doesn t need sorting
get is more vulnerable than post as it can be transmitted and stored
it recommends using ctr cmd + 1 to use the keyboard this is much better than having to use the mouse but i m still looking for a just do the right thing most of the time automatic solution
using post data is more secure than get because with get the details would be in the query string portion of the url
i got a draggable object done with jquery ui and when i drag it it s way slower than i move my mouse
note that this usually happens under the release profiling which is more strict by default about errors than say debugging
this is ancedotal but the postgresql servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than mysql which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down
i don t see why sbcl should be so fast - scheme is a far simpler language than common lisp
putting the salt at the beginning is better than putting it at the end as more randomness at the beginning of hash is better than randomness at the end
what about using more than one encoder to encode my code because if we take a look at ioncube you will see some people can decoder it
first you could try to convert the second do while loops to a for-loop which is more appropriate for the situation but i did not use for simplicity s sake
the problem is that if i have more than one checkbox checked and i want to uncheck one the button disables
in practice i ve never had resource management issues with wxhaskell although i agree that it s possible and is an area handled better by gtk2hs which uses reference counting in the underlying library
the javascript addeventlistener domcontentloaded is more watching tags and their good closures to start his job instead of the real full data load
that said i found icefaces to be a useful product and much better than richfaces especially in terms of the quality of the documentation
as mdpi is less than hdpi so it will take the values from the folder which is least below it in you case it is values which is applicable to all
presumably the mac malloc aligns to bigger boundaries and so it s spotting the pointer you re passing to free can t be correct since it has the wrong alignment
my experience is that designers can use whichever they prefer usually and most agree that verilog is easier to use and the code is shorter fact than equivalent vhdl
des is the least secure 3des is better but i d go for the aes
there are relatively simple solutions if the parent always have an index greater than the children but that is not the case here
all we are doing here is comparing if min is lesser than the current and max is greater than the current
in retrospect what you re trying to do will not get you to make the imageview circular because the default imageview is rectangular the height is always more than the width and so.
on the other hand show hide is more reliable
i m working on an app to load an amount of images from sd card using asynctask + for-loop i ve test the app on my galaxy nexus the app working perfectly but it will crash if i use more than 33 loops
instead use stronger passwords with salt hash which are harder to break using brute force and are not susceptible to rainbow table attacks if the choice is between pin and password
while this is much less convenient than stateful wicket i still find much better than say stateless jsf or struts
not using the same named is a more common practice to avoid confusion and shadowing
having said i am really not sure why you are getting unexpected behavior i ran your code both in eclipse and intellij ide and i always got for-loop approach as faster than while loops
and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still start up faster than emacs
also it seems this is only the problem when there are a lot of duplicates the heap doesn t seem completely capable of staying in order the parent is smaller than the children
you ll need to set the top margin for whatever item you want under it to be greater than the height of your navbar in order for it to show up correctly
i know the last paragraph might not be a correct question so maybe more generally as the vsto add-in is working with the office application process what can i do here so that a call to setforegroundwindow will work
you might be able to avoid asking this sort of question in the future if you start using a google-chrome s inspect element context menu command or b firebug for firefox which is more or less the same thing
i think this is better done with a post redirect get so the url can be bookmarked
get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post
i m about to try apache but most write ups suggest that this is worse than nginx at this job
is this even possible for starters because this is about adding protocols to setter and a getter is much more easy like
but i just get more confused with how strncpy or printf are not good
any better way than to explode and implode the string
using and at the same time to check equality on a int results in slower code because it takes two comparisons instead of one taking the double amount of time
irrlicht is no way better than ogre 3d or am not trying to prove that
i stumbled upon the above where someone answered a question regarding implementing a tree that has 2 nodes and i just wanted to get someone s thoughts on how best to implement a family tree with parent nodes which have more than two children nodes
i find swt to be an uglier api than swing in general though but not really a deal breaker
but it s natural if we have 2 or more children with a parent to move them into parent block
that s pretty broad though depending on what you re doing you may be better off with removeclass and addclass
but if the collection isnâ t sorted a simple linear search is more efficient than sorting just for a single use of binary search not to speak of the fact that binary search works with list s only while filtering findany works with any stream supporting every kind of source collection
get is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as post does
fortunately vb.net finally ended all that and is completely pixel based you can still alter you viewport scaling but .net seems to handle that much better than vb6
i don t know react so can you make any parent element with reactid not accept more than certain children
upgrading a language or service can often have disastrous or unexpected consequences thus sandboxing alternate versioning seems the better approach plus it makes projects immune from os upgrade
when i want to get more than 54 post i receive this error
i m not sure if this is the answer but states that if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate
every time you mouseover the image the caption keeps going higher and every time you mouseout it goes lower and lower
you might want to investigate more than creating ram disk
if you were planning on doing this for more than one properties i d recommend making car inherited from dependencyobject or implementing it from inotifypropertychanged instead of creating events for each
if you really need to enter the sub-directory however you can create recursive calls and in the call you can check if the directory has further deeper folder by using directoryinfo.getdirectories
the reason i wanted to investigate this was because both c and ocaml were significantly faster than haskell for this program
i would recommend against taking this decision lightly it s a good deal more complex than tcp udp amqp etc
the idea is to get the library and application loaded from ram into ram which is much faster than loading from disk
you are doing the opposite causing your loop to do nothing since z is never smaller than min or larger than max
p.s this will only work if the draggable is smaller than droppable which is true in this case
android plot and other free chart solutions mentioned here doesn t support annotations the only one is afreechart which is a port of jfreechart for android i am currently using it and it is awesome and has much more features than achartengine
compareto defines whether your base student is greater than less than or equals to your studenttocompare and you can define these with any criteria you please
as sven marnach wrote in the comments your problem is most likely i o bound since disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access
the docs for ionic 2 are clear user-friendly and much less intimidating than angular 2 docs
why does division take so much longer than multiplication
after some additional thought here s how i solved the problem but i d like to know if there s a better way than toggling show hide w different status messages at certain points in my code
3 is it filtered to a narrower than max time range or not crank it up to last 90 days or maybe an even bigger custom range
since i m against get and pro post which is safer method here s an example with post
change the half to 0.5 and you should be golden for the math part also multiplication is faster so use it instead of division when possible
as a side note the children can t have a higher z-index than their parent so everything inside .codbg is -1 behind the page then you need to fix the tab images the problem is not that they re behind the background it s that they re transparent and look darker on top of a darker background
as you noticed yoou cannot create an rss campaign feeded by more than oone feed
a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work
map is slightly better because the shared dictionary has around 480 entries instead of around 450 but it s still inconsistent and not all 500 as expected
i think select elements are even harder than radio button and checkbox i don t think there is a reliable html css only for this
various people told me to go with nunit since it s better than mstest apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using
well if _ uses native .foreach then that s easily order of magnitude slower than for-loop but still your problem is 4 nested loops right now so you might not even need the additional 10x after fixing that
i think using getter setter is simpler but here s an example of what i did to make it work
what i want to do is to search for all parent who has more then n children in other words i would want to get all user records that had an activity more then n times within given period of time eventtimestamp
what i want to do is place two controls at the same position spot to be specific a button that contains a progressbar inside of it and a button that contains a icon once the progress bar is full i want to switch it to the button which has the icon like a checkbox toggle button it has more than one state when i change it it changes the controls
all that said postgresql is much more acid compliant than mysql it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post
first you probably need to do more than just salt and hash your password
we chose to not do cascade since it is easy enough to traverse your own model and do deletes and when the other use case pops up where you just want to delete the parent entity but not children it is easier to code and not have to undo the cascade logic
but i heard that xlsb loads way faster than xlsm so i would not like to change the fileformat
like laravel i see has lot of classes while codeigniter has much less classes and looks simpler to read follow extend
i want to cut large csv files file size more than ram size and use them or save each in disk for later usage
it s not too hard for the fat filesystems as it s quite simple and well documented but it s more difficult for ntfs as the filesystems is much more complicated and not-so-well documented
and as you hopefully knows multiplication have higher precedence than addition so the expression is equivalent to probably not what was intended by the macro writer
this would make things considerably easier as the android library has native support for json serialization and making http get requests to restful urls is much simpler than http post requests it s not a huge deal but just less stuff you have to worry about
i have done some research about them and it seems to be that spi is faster than i2c but the last one ensures more control and error detection over the first one
is that better than just get the .js already compiled and put it on vendor folder
i haven t worked with any more than jpg png and gif so there might be some more image types out there that can fit into this function bmp
as with all the cases when weight is involved be sure that the needed space for width for the 2 children is less than what the parent can offer otherwise you will have things off screen
the pattern in scanner is supposed to be a regular expression that describes all the characters you don t want included in a token repeated one or more times this last part is because the words may be delimiter by more than one spaces punctuation etc.
better than hide and show
are you expecting some devilishly complex scheme that hold locks for smaller granularity than put or get
we plan to use gson extensively in the application as it seems safer and better than jackson
post is more secure than get because you aren t showing information anywhere
i would recommend to check which of width or height is bigger in order to know if you are in portrait or in landscape and adapt your math to this parameter
sometimes a property getter setter does more work then just hold a value
a trie is better suited to this kind of thing because it lets you store your symbols as a tree and quickly parse it to match values or reject them
instead i m using post which isn t exactly bullet proof but still a better choice than get in this case
istanbul has more complete coverage stats not just lines - branches etc and can export to lcov for tools like code climate
not too easy extending redcarpet this way maybe kramdown is easier
i recently switched from unity to unreal and the first thing i wanted to do is create a skybox but the only thing it seems to support is a skydome which has far more polygons than a cube and the generated .dds cubemap files are far too huge to be used in webgl projects
in case it s helpful since you seem perhaps more familiar with objective-c than swift here s what your swift method would look like if we translated it back into objective-c
since you want to map some fields to others using a dictionary is a better choice than using a list
i have heard division takes more time then multiplication but beyond that i could not determine whether writing this in one line or multiple assignment lines was more efficient
i had a similar problem using ggmap geocode for a batch of locations where roughly 20 of locations gave the over query limit error even though geocodequerycheck would show more than enough geocoding queries remaining and the errors were sporadically spread throughout the locations not just the last 20
so long as the nodes in general have more parent than children this direction will be much faster
instead i want those scripts to look in a custom directory let s say dependencies folder in the main project first so that i can directly put those externals in that folder which is much easier than putting them into the vc folder or manually setting the paths
i ve written my own protocol since i need it to be lightweight and i m sending files that may be bigger than the ram available on the device â â therefore the files are being streamed straight from the network to disk
if you want to break this convention then perhaps changing it to a do-while loop is more appropriate
sometimes the chart is instantly visible but when i rotate the screen between landscape portrait it keeps getting bigger every rotation
and of course use post method instead of get because get is more limited
i would recommend placing the common files in the same directory as the solution file or no more than 1 folder deep
when everything seems easier with getter and setter
but you should consider that disk io is way slower than ram
to me it s fairly intuitive that comparing double is slower when taken into consideration that double are more complex and take up double the memory of int but why is it so much slower
if you want longer hash lets call more secure you should use something like sha512 whirlpool etc
i think it s related to the specific router implementation because on one hand if a udp packet disappears then both sides probably know it might happen and can afford to lose a packet or two but on the other hand if a tcp packet disappears then by it s fail-safe mechanism it will send another and the problem is solved and tcp packet is much heavier
edit going into why vim or emacs is far more powerful in many respects than your typical ide could get quite lengthy and there are already several questions on so which cover that
google-chrome is reporting the missing key with a higher severity than firefox is so i want to eliminate that as a possible cause
but i found if i do not set their cpu affinity that is they run on same core 0 the time performance get better than setting cpu affinity 8.76s vs 14.66s
you can also chose to get more than 25 post at once
i have found that pull is more scalable than push
the first problem is obviously the lack of a salt value which means if 2 users have the same password they will have the same hash which makes it easier to compromise multiple accounts
2 you probably want a namedtuple - i m pretty sure they re lighter than dictionary and you can access properties using dot notation for which i have an aesthetic preference anyway
if you need something that works out of the box choose flume once you decide whether push or pull makes more sense
not only do png files have natural support for transparency they are also smaller than bmp files
if you d like broader support over the serializable deserialization you can always use jackson to do so
once that is done you can go in and tweak the data types to better fit your needs if desired and you can add your own restrictions to the data such as requiring that an xs int value be in a range of 0 and 50 or an xs string value be less than 10 chars long - there are dozens of other possibilities but that should give you the idea
now it is just a matter of defining whether get or post makes more sense for you and implementing the corresponding methods doget or dopost or both at your servlets
once again my question is why is my program crashing if the width is larger than the height when the computer plays
once you re past the basics with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost
a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this
but if your key space is vastly larger than the number of targets you ll have a sizable number of hash-collision where you ll have to check if the target stored there is really the key you re looking
i used to think heaps have this property but it just seems that the only requirement is for the children to be less than the parent
but mine is large and spans across a maze of folder directory and grows even larger as the development team adds to it
looks like it is about a half a second firefox google-chrome is less than that when selecting on two elements over 100 000 iterations
problem is that although both datagridview filling and updating a progressbar goes from same loop in steps by 100 filling of datagridview ends much faster than progressbar show a progress and hide it on about 50
what i m going to do after either creating or finding a library like this is to then change the way it produces the output to make it more biased to produce certain examples more than others so in the previous example i can make it more biased to produce more expressions with addition in them rather than multiplication
so you do have to be careful not to lose track of what code is client-side and what is server-side which is slightly more difficult when both types of code use the same language but is still not very hard
in case of primitives memory comes into play.if you are going to store double into int as in your example double takes more memory as compare to integer.so there is chance of data lose.so compiler throw error.if you cast yourself then you know what you are doing so compiler let that do
like i describe in the first paragraph use of accessor methods getter and setter is a more idiomatic approach and easier to understand for someone else using your code
anyone knows how to bypass this problem and get more than 100 post
you may want to consider using jquery timers instead which abstracts away many of the ugly details of settimeout setinterval and makes them easier to use in your code for things like what you are describing
at least they are much easier to intall even pyqt is hard to code for me and wxpython is less attractive when it comes to looks
in fact icmp especially the ttl excceeding message has even less limitations than udp on nats for the error message can be sent from every corner of the internet and routers with nat cannot be aware that these messages are not the true ones
i am trying to create a figure in which the colorbar will extend beyond the data range go higher than the max value of data
it can handle parent with more than two children and with a more complex input data set we could leverage the graph approach to do even more cool stuff
you should probably always use an id number that way if you change the type name you don t need to update the user table it also allows you to keep your datasize down as a table full of int is much smaller than one full of 45 chars varchars
the ssd is still slower than ram by orders of magnitude but it s quite reasonable to have a 50gb hash table on disk but not in ram unless you pay big money for big iron
can children have more than one parent
if your working data set is larger than available ram your server may spend a lot of time shuffling files from disk to memory
i m not familiar with the particular problem you describe and i don t know whether there is some specific fix for it but one workaround is using background-image background-position which is easier to fine-tune
we have the following stackoverflow answer for reference which describes the case where chars can be larger than int which backs up the assertion in the discussion above
2 filtering per grouping make sure the number of rows for the grouping is larger than 1 and then either the first gene starts with unknown which means the whole grouping contains unknown since unkown has been sorted to the end or take the first row
in case if you have flexibility to choose another testing framework you can try with testng which has bigger feature set than junit
post requests can be much larger than get requests as get requests are limited by the maximum length of a url
if you will be classifying multi-paragraph text all in one language a functional words list which your bag of words with pruning of hapaxes will quickly approximate might well serve you perfectly and could work better than n-gram
it could be done via division which is much slower than addition or it could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version
i think it isn t good idea put your list directly to actioncontext you can use session for that or better list with getter setter in you action class
so when trying to make things more reliable as atoi and easier to use as strtol solutions like kirilenko s would be used
if you want to print a list delimiter by spaces here is a more flexible solution that can support any number of elements
i recommend not to use jpg as mask because of its lossy format i recommend bmp or png bmp is better
the reason i ask is that it seems like nvidia has way better tools and ati seems to have cancelled rendermonkey
as it s widely known that an asynchronous post request is better since the user won t get a perception that the app has crashed while it s loading the long process
i would have used getter and setter but from the books that i ve read and the forums that i frequent i know that the general consensus is that having getter and setter is even worse than public fields
in order to avoid matching empty strings by including spaces as delimiter it makes more sense to me to allow them and use a call to trim to get rid of them
the issue is that once the alpha of the uiview is less than 1.0 i can see all the subviews sides and the one that gets me the most is the outline of an uiimageview can be seen that would otherwise not as it is the same colour as the uiview
in effect post is no more secure than get
i wanted to ask if there is a better solution than using stringbuilder to cut some part of a string which is parsed from a method through bufferedwriter to a file
on that base a get is more appropriate then a post
actually i found out why using two radio button with same names and different values true and false is better than checkbox
and would the answer be different in a case where screens switching is more frequent like between an overworld screens and a battle screens in a game like final fantasy or pokemon
please you a job queue that is more efficient than cron jobs
a dawg is ideal but a trie is simpler and a decent starting point
i have an arrays of integer and i am trying to iterate back the for-loop to the last index it visited based on some condition lets say i have 2 9 15 19 23 28 37 elements in that loops i am giving a condition that if each element of that loops is greater than a number lets say 8 it will process that element again
we provide a number of support resources which may get faster response than post on third party sites including the virtuoso users mailing list public support forums and confidential support cases
i am trying to understand what would happen if the max node is somehow smaller than some of the min nodes.
both have the effect of the order by not being executed at all -- and so not executed after the grouping by in the first case the effect is to remove sorting from the grouping by and in the second the effect is to do nothing more than the grouping by already does
more over it is better to track buttons on event itself see this question for more details as mouseup mousedown event might be triggered outside of the page effectively getting you cached state out of sync
i have a table and it has checkbox what i want is when more than two checkbox are selected my button should be visible and vice versa
so i tried to make it simpler with a for-loop but have been unable to work out how to add labels to each plot inside loops
if distance of x movement and y movement is less than 10 and difference between mousedown and mouseup is greater that 300 user is about to initiate click event or continue with drag-drop event
the awt approach seems closer to bare metal but since jdk 6 brought a lot of improvements in swing rendering pipeline i would go the swing java2d approach
how to make textures appears above each other as the shapes in color switching game when i touch screens there s one more shape is appear such as circles sticks and other shapes so how can i do that in libgdx
but then the user of my cms has to include multiple folder into multiple directory which makes everything more complicated.
i think in terms of performance using a single for-loop is faster am i right 3 linqs will be eventually converted to 3 loops
interfacing with usb is more difficult than it sounds it would be harder to build something which would interface with that and measure millivolts than with bluetooth because the pic processor you use for analog to digital sampling and usb client would in fact have to either act as usb host or usb otg on a phone which is far more complicated than being a usb peripheral
you could also test every time in the for-loop and include a break statement but because you don t know when it will stop i think a while loops is better in this case
i suspect this will submit the right form data but may not be acceptable if your button is calling js and is doing more than submission form data
i have an rss feed that has a larger number of objects in it than the photo frame it s destined for can handle
but in general this wouldn t work because of the specified width is bigger than the real one and exceed it so there s no margin to auto it and center the content which found in div
i try it and i get all the categories and not just the ones with more than 1 post in them
mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem
can anyone explain why the while loops is taking more time than the for-loop even though the looping of i and j is almost same
what i would like to do is use css media queries to have the title be above the tabs when the screens gets smaller or on a tablet or iphone
in other words i think post with x-http-method-override get header is better solution
there is more than one rss in hugo one for the root and then one for each section and taxonomy tags etc but it is not possible to create multiple rss feed for say the home page
a topic can be a sub-topic of more than one parent topic and itself have one or more specialized topics as children
when your working set exceeds the amount of ram then it will carry on working but with noticeably degraded performance as things will then be constantly having to go to disk which is far less performant
i suppose it sort of makes sense to do things this way except for the fact that metal appears to play better with objective-c even though it looks like swift
so it would also be possible to have all three textblock columns starsized but that means width clipping does occur earlier and there is more margin
moving iterator from one element to the next is an o c operation both in the list and in the multi map except c is slightly smaller for the list so it is unlikely you ll gain much by combining the two
you can also see that for smaller collections quicksort is faster but then mergesort takes the lead but all of this is case specific so take your time to study all 4 algorithms
google-chrome has more of the market than safari not and invitation for flame wars just a personal opinion without any weight -
i ve tried to load the page on google-chrome not blazingly fast but acceptable less than 1 second then tried on firefox takes more time between 2 and 3 seconds
update i made some changes to my code but was already suspecting what others here have already pointed out sure the enhanced for-loop is slower but outside of very trivial tight loops the cost should be a miniscule fraction of the cost of the logic of loops
on tablet the screens size is much bigger and there is enough space for most of the action items that s why your menu is placed on top
so no choice of the public exponent for this modulo is better than 19 using the public exponent to decrypt will work for at least half of the messages when eâ² 9 16 and in many cases for almost all the messages when eâ² 1 16
already to filtering by the elements of grouping 2 i need to use another query reducing the amount of cross join because grouping 2 has fewer types only types 4 and 5
it doesn t show at all if hide is called less than 0.5s after show and it show for at least 0.5s this prevents very fast flickering stuff that you might see with naive implementations
sometimes you ll find that jpeg at 100 quality ends up smaller than the gif or png version but most of the time line art is best stored in png form
the remote server is set up to allow very few maximum concurrent clients generally nginx handles many concurrent clients better than apache since it doesn t need to fork a new process for every request so if it becomes an issue you might want to look into switching web servers
the most urgent one that comes to mind is that a double is wider than an int on your platform and garbage memory is read
is there any way to handle the numbers and or the sin cos arccos functions more accurate to make the outcome get better
your friend has a point a division actual division not just writing in c is slower than a multiplication
use picasso glide or fresco to load images inside those cards picasso and glide are easier to use compared to fresco but fresco is better with memory
one of the nice side effects of this structural change does happen to be performance but not because of anything inherent to java by focusing on classes and getter setter it makes it easier to really pay attention to expensive operations and caching
instead initiate all the settimeout s you need for the entire animation at the same time with increasing delays in a loop and let them run their course or better yet use setinterval which is the better way of doing animations and how for instance jquery s animations work
so when i call in main the resize function goes in the second if it first crops the bottom of the matrix cause the new height is smaller that the old height nh nl after the crop it goes on the remaining lines 2 and it realloc s memory so that it can fill the new width with and it all goes well
you can give clients a type-safe interface in the form of fold but they have to be willing to write all their code in a higher-order style and since fold is a catamorphism it becomes harder to look at more than one layer at a time
i seem to be getting the impression that wordpress is more popular than joomla nowadays
what s odd is that usually this doesn t happen - so far i ve only encountered this error when the original image has height greater than width and it has been filtered by another app called camera+...the exact same photo before filtering causes no problems and a filtered landscape photo also seems to be fine
the best solution is to write a custom version of strncpy that is less weird or if you know the length of the input just use strcpy
if you re looking for something less heavy than django perhaps try flask or bottle
either will do the trick but bottle or in my preference flask will be faster as it is much more lightweight than django
one way to check whether or not a double is a whole number without knowing the calculation type this works for more than just division would be to subtract the int part to get the fractions part and compare to zero
i have used both apache-poi and docx4j extensively and having said that docx4j is more robust as it offers more support out of the box for not only the document itself but for tables and images
also if you re setting these on mouseover and mouseout it is arguably clearer to simply use the hover event instead
a lot of people use iphones ipads and safari is literally the only option even google-chrome is more like safari in disguise... so it s quite a portion of users who are suffering from this issue
from my experience every time the kindle fires up my landscape app with a width smaller than the height thus by definition not really giving me a landscape view i just ignore the surface and wait it quickly gives me a a real landscape flipping the height and width so that its a true landscape view
the z-index for the children should be higher than the parent
years ago before i got more familiar with the awt swing model and the edt i used to write code that violates many many java standards code that ll make any reasonable programmer recoil in horror
to expand on the udo s answer there is the program rpm which manipulates specifically the packages it is asked to manipulate and there is yum which is a more intelligent management system that can find dependencies and download .rpm files even if they re not in the system
considering the lack of windows 8 love that xna is getting support being dropped apps won t be sellable on the app store -- i d go with slimdx -- it s better than xna anyway -- the only down side is that you can t make xbox apps with it
firstly i am not sure how to properly use multi-thread with junit last time i tried i had no success anyway i have had better results with testng
like this i may have more than two get post insert or update methods i have to acces this methods from my console application how can i map the methods i want cana any one help me here how will i define the routes for this
first of all never send int s and other types larger than chars like that - you will ignore endianness and the recipient might be unable to interpret the data properly
writing swift 2.0 in my professional work my personal opinion is that it s indeed ready for enterprise applications -- maybe even more than objective-c ever were
or how is it better than post redirect get if the functions can in fact be used in solving my particular problem
i find grouplayout to be fine to code by hand certainly no harder than gridbaglayout though i can certainly see why it would be a favorite for tools to use
this would generally be the wrong inheritence structure if your saying what i think you are the reason being that children should not be less restrictive than parent
i m able to query my database below to get the result that i want but i don t want to have to iterate through all of the author objects just the ones that have more than one post
as a coder sql is my weakest link since i am far more comfortable with imperative languages than declarative ones - but i want to change that
then you can use the itemcheckedchanged event which will get triggered when an item is checked and here you can see how many items are currently checked and if more than one show the element with the text and hide the tokens
managing the content via width is a better approach you don t really need to know the height
also your csv looks more like a tsv tab separated instead of comma separated
if i have a for-loop for example and and i want to use something like math.round to round the number but i only need to round the number one time i.e the number doesn t change throughout loops is it better to store it into a variable and then use the variable to in the condition or does it not matter
i generally don t write unit tests for bean classes with little more than getter and setter
this blog post explains more on how to get an access token on android
of course you could do fancier interpolation with a splines being the next step
the next example does more or less the same except from an oop perspective
the system still in use today from what i hear is responsible for ingesting more than 3000 rss feed probably a lot more than that now into a cms
or if you ve got tcl 8.6 dictionary map is perhaps better
the fact that mac users tend to be less unix-savvy than linux or freebsd users probably doesn t help but even without that this is a perfect way to end up with thousands of people who have a pip and a python that doesn t match and no idea why
if you really want to use selenium inside an android app you might have better luck with appium
the question s if i am currently looking at a desktop lg and the print paper width is more like small sm can i get the height of the table as if it were sm
a lot of the solutions i ve seen are client-side - i think a server-side solution makes more sense for my needs since i can give feedback to the user if the javascript is invalid and only save it on the server once it s clean
this is much easier with war or uberjar which include all dependencies within because otherwise you need to add all dependencies on the classpath as well which will take additional effort
to release it even though what it actually does is little more than malloc and free but by having you call these functions they provide a well-defined and clear api which assumes responsibility for knowing such things
you can either prepend a dot to your image address which means go to parent directory meaning get out of css and then look for images or you can move your images folder to your css folder whichever is more comfortable for you
more detail set the amount of time the animation will take for fadeout and use a delay for the fadein animation that is longer than the fadeout animation time
i found this how to detect the orientation of a pdf document in iphone sdk - but when i try to get the dimensions of the pdf the height is always bigger than the width no matter what orientation the pdf has.
is there a way to allow the pop-up window to expand beyond the dialog but be bounded by the window and thus provide scrolling when the pop-up is larger than the window
i was taught from him that using get requests was better than post but after reading up i would like to switch to post my only problems is i am a little unsure how to modify my code to switch over from get
if your hide show logic becomes more complicated you can move it into a method on your controller
both give you the ability to implement things in a variety of ways which can be confusing but ember.js provides more of the code that you would have to write yourself in backbone.js as standard which for me personally is more important for rapid prototyping than the wealth of backbone.js examples available
i have this grid each coordinate in the grid can be either closed or open i m tying to using an open coordinate find all the open coordinates around the first that are valid and the walk range between then is equal or lower than the max walk range
this query lists all parent sharing the same children where there are more than one parent
regarding frequency of polling when no connection is maintained google-chrome appears to be 3 seconds where as firefox s is much larger
creating the views with code only i think one is better off with subclassing if it comes to more than one level of inherited or many ancestor classes for just one base view
the youtube approach seems much more efficient as far as amount of code and simplicity of understanding which makes me wonder why vimeo would use promises in this simple fast case
a note on the runtimeexception re if you catch a nullpointerexception nullpointerexception and throw a re you are actually losing information since nullpointerexception is a more specific error rather than re
mainly you re just missing the test for whether the difference between min and max is more than your threshold
my problem is now after changing some stuff my game crashes when the computer plays its move if the width is too much greater than the height
in instant articles configuration i only see one input box for submitting rss feed url can we have more than one feed for facebook instant articles
i had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this
but as the inline code gets longer the savings for inlining become smaller so maybe you could just have a hard limit on the size of the code - any code to be inline must be smaller than the limit
if it stores it as pointers on the heap won t qlist be much worse off than qvector
i can t help with the coding side of your question but if you re passing in a non-url input then the post method would be more appropriate than get
using varchar is less efficient than using tinyint like aju john suggested in his comment but unless i m dealing with a really performance-critical or a huge table - i find it easier to deal with
also your examples about why int would be better than boolean are kinda flawed
did maven has achieved more then ant or ant is still alive
while i won t start a war of ant vs maven maven is much more than just a build tool and that may help you in future
the myfile can have one parent and parent can have more than one children
i don t understand why if i count the number of items in the 2nd response the number of post is smaller than the number of post i get from 1st query
in firefox this might be handled a little nicer than google-chrome but rather than completely redraw an element you should try to append only what you need
if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries
this tablet has a bigger screens yet is still showing only 2 child views in the row
for example if i declare and only use it in a way that it could have and should have been declared since chars uses less memory than int will gcc optimize that or does it not even matter since it will be converted to assembly
currently i m using only the portrait orientation for all devices but the portrait orientation looks better on phones meanwhile landscape orientation looks better on tablets
i haven t read the paper on edison but if it s nothing more than the haskell implementation of purely functional data structures doesn t it make more sense to port the sml code that s in the book thesis
i should also mention that this happens once the data is larger than ram and it s increasing size on the disk
so by above statement min is more than max version it is not logical so i have changed this to below
vb.net seems to think lots of things are objects one way or another but vb6 has stronger typing in this case
if you want to force all the views to have the same ration on screens the only way is to give it a size dynamically after you calculated the ratio between the desired pixels and the screens density which is not really a solution what you need to understand is when working with various screens sizes each one suppose to behave differently a tablet screens is expected to be bigger and thus having more room for elements to show up on screens a phone screens is smaller and less elements should be showed on screens you need to adjust your view to support all of these screens and the proper way is to write a different layout for tablet and phones or even different layout by screens dpi
you can safely upgrade to trunk its better than last versioning anyway
i personally would just skip using awt and move to swing which provides better built in functionality for this type of thing
if you wish to make a more complicated property with getter and setter that do more than merely set the property without polluting the namespace you may hold the underlying value in a closure
time i upgrade to this versioning is much later time of above topic so i don t think because compose versioning issue
double metaphone - this algo will give you a better match than soundex at the cost of speed it is really good for spelling correction though
it seems gson is more faster than jackson the average time of gson is about 2ms while jackson is about 16ms does i make mistake when using jackson
how are push notification better than pull notification on iphones
if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication
i should also mention that crypt has this built-in and may be a better solution than md5
alternately you could assume you are instead intending to take the smallest possible distance between the two outer angles in which case max could actually be a lower value than min and still be valid for testing
the problem was the same on both versioning though perhaps a bit worse after the upgrade
keeping a list of children in the parent makes more sense from this aspect
this folder has way more than 1 directory and has a bunch of files so apparently it snot reading something correctly
if min is always less than max then you can also do
geddy is not better than connect express the big thing that differs is the structure of it
note it can be significantly slower than min or max in large data sets so once you get confident your results are accurate then you can switch to one of the other functions for performance
my other thought was a recursive cte with the first query pulling the min date for each patient then a union where the table date was at least 30 days greater than the max of each patients cte date but you can t have a max in the join statement
so my question is beyond instrumentation and the profiling using memory leaks which tells you the location of creation of the leaky object but not the root cause are there any other tools i could run that could give me any more info than instrumentation re tracking down the root cause point
you can also add some get parameters to a post request which are received on the server side as long as the get url is not longer that 1024 bytes
what if both children are equal and smaller than the parent
i think a.__init__ self x is better then super .__init__ x because it supports multiple inheritance and i didn t find a way to do it with super
but that post is currently put on hold as my post question is more technically-oriented rather than just a general-purpose question
you can check for each of those divs if it s parent has more than 3 children
you lose two benefits of data base consistency data persists after a crash and you need more ram which is more expensive and scarce than disk flash
it is just an example that shows a scenario in which get is more secure than post but i don t think it would be a good idea to choose get over post from this attack reason
the hide show variant is much faster
once you have this you should be able to have more than one sqldatareader shared on the same sqlconnection in your code and use them independently of one another
but i am lost a bit here because i am not sure how to set up the form get or post is better for this need
at that point either get or post will work post is usually better
so far the only legitimate reason i ve found to use datamapper over activerecord is that datamapper is better in terms of the single responsibility principle -- because the database rows are not the actual objects being persisted but with propel that doesn t really concern me because it s generated code anyway
btw why do you want to use fakeiteasy it looks to me less powerful than moq
but my code only works if the parent element is always higher on the list than the children and i want to make that work universally
i was originally using nsscanner because it was easier than nsnumberformatter to use but i ran into the same problem it doesn t parse the entire string just the first number in the string
still you must increase max also if your minimum is anything less than 15 the adk is now building an extra folder new stuff in truth the new version of the adt is annoying i am just starting and now you will see they have enforced the use of fragments
i don t think that as of today you can run these tests and determine with any certainty whether swift 1.0 is faster or slower than objective-c
for a simple image toggle you might have an easier time with a hide show style instead
i see that the paid version of wunderground has some higher tiers with more features but openweathermap s free tier allows a huge number of uses
when post is better than get
i think you can do exactly what you want with dill which provides better serialization than pickle
why everybody here is saying post is more secure than get when used over https
when dealing with lists think of car as the first element of the list and cdr as the rest of the elements and cons adds one more element at the head of the list - that element can be anything including another list
first you make post request although get request is more suitable for search pupposes
the fact that checking with isinstance the membership in a concrete type is not so good while checking the membership in an abc is more often useful lies in a principle that the gang of 4 expressed clearly and intensely in the first part of their wonderful book design patterns in a mostly c++ context but it really applies much more widely than that
for more day-to-day end users having canned reports that might be modified by the end user via a simple user interface that allows them to modify restrictions grouping sorting is more useful
this is a good example of a time to know the basics - i think understanding the ins and outs of struct is more helpful than typedef since you can do so much more with it
in my opinion swing is easier to learn and to use but the results of swt are often nicer - you can often feel that a swing application behaves not completely right
pandas is far more flexible for working with data so i often bring parts of dask dataframes into memory manipulate columns and create new ones
i ve never done any network programming lower than using libpcap winpcap so i would be happy for any suggestions.
if you want to learn lisp paip is a better choice to start with because it will teach you a lot about common lisp and a smallish chunk of scheme
in a lot of code the size of a variable isn t critical because the number is within such a range that a few thousand is way more than you ever need - number of chars in a filename is defined by the os and i m not aware of any os where a filename path is more than 4k chars - so a 16 32 or 64 bit value that can go to at least 32k would be perfectly fine for counting that - it doesn t really matter what size it is - so here we should use int not try to use a specific size
your actual delimiter looks more like comma followed by a spaces to me
i was expecting the parent widget to have a little larger sizehint than the children layout
my ultimate question for this post is can i specify some form of expression in a media query in css that will simply compare the device-width and device-height and display one style when the width is greater than height and vice versa
it seems like the draggable element including the margin is bigger than the droppable element and therefore the dropped status is set although the element does not seems to touch the upper droppable yet
but if you want to get the username of the user who makes the post is easier than that you only need to access the request.user
i recently moved from autotest to guard for a reason it works better than autotest and it has a lot of available guard
search to each tabs in more than one toolbar
take into account that lazy mappings will be disabled so it may be useful to evaluate what will be need to be set to fetchtype.eager with fetchmode.subselect if more than 1 bag is needed to be initialized with it
which means a big tablet screens gets the lower dimen values and images and everything looks extra small
i d say that firefox is correct in being stricter than google-chrome here even though i m not entirely sure the base uri has changed and this new uri should be used for the relative uri #symboltype1 too
speaking of get request types you should also know that get requests tend to perform better than post
while it is possible to explore non-imperative computer concepts it doesn t seem to be worth the effort at the current time - building a declarative machine as an interpreter on top of an imperative machine is much cheaper and faster than a true declarative machine
because there can be more than one pop-up dialog active
this post is more to get advises and ideas rather than solving a problem
it seems that the idea of uu-parsinglib it to be more declarative than parsec so you just have pure
decltype is significantly more versatile that auto and can always be used in place of it
my answer based on mikko s but allowing better control over min and max limits of breaks and bin size
i understand from searching on so that setinterval is a better way to approach this that settimeout which i was using initially but i haven t figured out how to specify that the function needs to repeat
std ostringstream is much better for that kind of thing
also removing the m from a parent directory is trickier than it might seem so we need to make sure we move from the bottom of the tree the files first and not rename the directories till we re done with all the children
since the paddle object has properties that are shared by both player and enemy composition is a better choice than inherited
the manage link used to come up fine if there are more than one versioning for a document but since i ve upgrade to angular 1.2.0 whenever i create a new document which automatically creates one versioning for it and do subsequent edits on the same document creating more than one versioning the manage link fails to appear
if you don t want to write anything on autocompletetextview and select items you have to implement the spinner is more great
however std ostringstream is probably faster for appending if you absolutely have no idea about the size you have to reserve
i need to replace all words with 3 or more letters with the words thing while retaining capitalization and punctuation
specialization is unable to guess that for int or double is something more specific than that
if you are curious though rather than just trusting a book or a blog post it is better to make a simple example and take it apart - you get it straight from the horse s mouth and you learn a whole lot more
is post more compact than get since get requests have to be url-encoded
phusion passenger 4 enterprise bring many advantages over has more features than puma and rainbows for example it has out of band garbage collection can dynamically adjust the number of processes based on traffic completely automates rolling restarts so you don t need scripting etc
my service having more than 50 get post methods
to get a more reliable timing of the query you d need to use profiling or some other way of benchmarking that works more directly with the query
i ve read that painting to a qwidget is sometimes faster than qgraphicsview but it would by a lot of extra work for the mouse handling i think
also a union all takes longer than a union distinct
also in that if statement i am trying to say if the current hr is greater then my max or if both my hours are equal but my current min is greater then my maxmin
usually you use strsplit to break a string in parts but with substr there s an easier solution for your problem
i think that the accessors getter and setter is far better at least in your example
instead of working around the 1 label and image you get in a uibutton it s cleaner to start from scratch with a uicontrol and create your tiles
the solutions using a public constructor are fine too but as the constructor cannot be called directly on thr interface i think protected is better
this option is better than simply copying the file as it allows you to overwrite an existing file but you still don t get direct access to the file s properties
it s also much cleaner it s shorter and the best part is that it s 6 times faster than the chr ord solution
if you have setter and getter it s no better than public field
as far as the syntax goes i guess it s a bit different from the more classic syntax of the algol family languages but it s no more and possibly less weird than apl
quick idea - go through the roman number from right to left if value of more to the left is smaller than then subtract it from the result if larger then add it
i want to get all the users that has more than one post but
the swift designers went through a lot of trouble to make sure that it s more than just objective-c without the constraints of c in fact i almost wish they hadn t said that since it s so often misquoted
they seem to be trees in which each parent is strictly greater than its children
when taking input we can use either get or post.the input is shown in the url when using get but not when post is used.is there a situation where get is more useful than post
i mean by light weight i thought maybe the swing components occupy less memory than the awt components
there are also different types of trees -- i am going to assume that you are using a normal old tree any number of children no more than one parent one root node
