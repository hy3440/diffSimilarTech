10089044
ienumerable	iqueryable
note i would recommend the getallpersons and the getallhouses methods return iqueryable rather than ienumerable

10089087
orb	keypoint	flann	surf
its however best to used flann based matchers for sift or surf since they extract a higher number of keypoint as compared to orb and flann is suited to large sets of keypoint read more about it here

width	height
i don t want to give any height or width in javascript

subtraction	addition
if you need a real time object which is correctly printed in graphs for example and can be used in arithmetic addition subtraction you need to use isodatetime

10089344
posixct	strftime
if you just need a character column time you can convert the posixct output to string using strftime

10089350
post	put
in some post people suggest to put webview as subview in the last part of

10089365
pop-up	dialog
if you visit a page on the mdm web server with safari and get the pop-up dialog warning about the identity of the server then you will need to install the ssl certificate on the device to allow the certificate to be trusted

one thing you need to watch out for is that your managed project targets x86 if your dll is 32 bit or x64 if your dll is 64bit

10089558
division	subtraction
everything else works fine but try going to the subtraction or division part part of the exercise is not to ask questions in subtraction that have negative answers or division question that have division by 0 or the answer is less than 1

10089558
division	subtraction
btw i put comments to the part of my code that is supposed to restrict the division and subtraction

10089663
hide	show
currently when you remove the hide class it will show since it is being hidden by the css for that class and the slidedown call then does nothing

10089777
screens	tablet
this allows better logical breakdown of the various pages into different classes - fragments also provide other uses like being able to load multiple on-screen at once for larger screens layouts tablet

10089878
width	height
you may change the xxxxx to get width and height automatically according to your screen size of bartool or screen of your view

10089882
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in firefox safari and google-chrome

10089929
getter	setter
i have eliminated the getter setter methods for avoiding unnessary code

10089966
stdout	stderr
i then modified the test.ps1 script so that it outputs two files stderr and stdout when it runs so as to leave some proof behind

nsurl	nsstring
the clientwithbaseurl method expects an nsstring not a nsurl

10090164
post	get
as per the default for method is get it should be changed to post in the config obj

10090167
implements	extends
so if anyone has actually read this far p that doesn t compile and after looking up some documentation from oracle you can only have extends and not implements for generic parameters

10090198
implements	extends
extends has slightly different meaning when used for defining generic bounds - it essentially translates to is or extends or implements

10090222
google-chrome	safari
but during the loading of my url in the iframe it is not opening in google-chrome and safari

10090267
ienumerable	iqueryable
i have decided to resolve the companyid rather than the entire company entity i can get the list of ids in memory and im not fussed if that is iqueryable or just a plain array ienumerable

10090295
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
all uiviewcontroller subclasses have a field called parentviewcontroller that points at the uiviewcontroller subclass that owns them which a uipageviewcontroller uses

10090303

working fine on ie firefox and google-chrome where the banner only animate when play_banner is set to true so it stop working when the user changes the page and when he s back it continues from where it was.

ffmpeg	libav
now i want to process more advanced file formats such as media files video audio without using external library like libav and ffmpeg

10090393
filtering	grouping
the workaround for this was to do the grouping and filtering in memory and getting a larger amount of data back from the source

10090409
setinterval	settimeout
you shouldn t use setinterval you should use a settimeout inside a function and execute it on the callback of the .post something like

postgresql	mysql
my database adapter that rails uses in production is postgresql but i need to query a mysql database on another server

10090428

folder	directory
i just wondered whether someone could perhaps provide some guidance please on how i can create the relevant directory and move the files to the new folder structure i want to create

10090496
folder	directory
this will save time and hassel each time you add a new directory or folder as it wont require you to edit this file

10090506
folder	directory
i have included el-api2.2 and el-impl2.2 jar files in tomcat_home lib directory as well as i have also included el-impl2.2.jar in my project lib s folder

10090538
inherited	properties
i m trying to take advantage of properties value inherited from a window to a usercontrol

10090538
inherited	properties
i think my confusion stemmed from wanting to use the syntax of a non-attached dependency properties to achieve value inherited

10090538
inherited	properties
however according microsoft s properties value inherited page if you wish to inherited properties values then it must be through an attached properties

10090538
getter	setter
if above the code was re-written properly declare the property once with static getter setter methods then my xaml would look like this

10090572
post	get
the redirect suffix is only needed if you want to make a get request after a post from a backing bean action method

10090578
button	checkbox
the window also need to follow the jsf implementation ie i need some checkbox and a button on the popup window and would also need to apply jquery on the popup submit button

10090579
width	height
edit actually looking through the variables i save in settings class i see that i do save the width and height in pixels of the screen

10090585
folder	directory
it seems my default working directory was set to my eclipse folder for the project so i solved it by specifying the project root folder instead which normally is the case

10090608
gmail	hotmail
we need to support any email client outlook hotmail gmail etc

10090652
post	get
i get this error when i try to save a model whole variables are from post request

10090669
getter	setter
then declare static getter and setter methods like this in mainwindow

10090673
udp	tcp
you could also switch to udp if you don t want to setup a connection with each client but then you lose the reliability of tcp

10090710
public	protected
but doing this means i have to increase the visibility of the implementer from protected to public which is not nice

10090714
integer	unsigned
my take on this is that the result type should be an unsigned 16-bit integer with the value

10090740
mouseover	mouseout
no it s not possible because every css that will be applied on mouseover hover will be removed on mouseout and there is no other way to capture mouseover and out

10090742
swt	swing
i am very new to swt and while learning about it i came to know that all swt components are native based while most swing components are rendered in java code and are considered light weight

10090767
sorting	filtering
i was wondering where i should put logic for sorting and filtering a qt tables in a mvc model

10090796
post	get
the call that handles everything starting at case post the get is for retrieving messages

10090826
admob	inmobi
i am using webviews only in the ad networks i am using some of which are admob inmobi etc

10090839
sorting	filtering
if the sorting filtering is specific to a view then the filtering sorting logic belongs in the view

10090839
sorting	filtering
edit i suppose i should add that the logic itself doesn t necessarily belong in the view -- depending on the situation you might for example have a back-end that uses something like sql in which case the query that specifies the filtering sorting goes in the view but the implementation of the sorting filtering itself would end up in sql implementation

10090906
hive	hdfs
the cluster has hdfs map reduce hive pig and sqoop installed on it

10090913
hide	show
you could show it on submit and hide it on render

10090913
jsf	seam
as far as i know seam 2 was the only who offered a reuseable jsf component for this the

10090925
hide	show
then in your listadapter you ll simply show or hide the images you want

10090976
int	double
it logically represents a single value similar to primitive types int double and so on

10090981
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
because i know that it s probably not possible with javascript css is it possible to install a browser-plugin or something like that for safari google-chrome or firefox

10091049
getter	setter
it can have methods like hashcode equals and the standard getter setter but very little else

10091064
hide	show
what i m doing is separating this out in divs and having the submit button hide the current div and show the next one

10091077
filtering	grouping
ensure the filtering returns unique combinations of c1 c2 c3 using distinct or grouping by if necessary

10091087
google-chrome	firefox
ie is probably going to mess stuff up that works correctly in firefox or google-chrome

10091117
preventdefault	onkeydown
its sounding like you need to attach an event handler for onkeydown and then use both preventdefault and stoppropagation to prevent the postback

10091119
folder	directory
just for directory project folder traversal

10091120
post	get
the service was already properly configured for get and post protocols so that was not the issue

10091122
symfony	silex
i m trying to render a symfony form using twig in a silex application

10091139
gridview	rowdatabound
you need to modify the script in a way that can find the keys of the source and destination rows on client side you could include them in a hidden filed inside a template in your gridview and assign its value on rowdatabound

10091160
g++	gcc
however g++ gcc says it could not find string.hpp no matter what i tried

10091195
width	height
the problem with putting the icon in a div which is relative is that i need the div to be 100 height width of the td to be able to align the menu correct to the row

10091218
jsr168	jsr286
according to the jsr168 and jsr286 docs for portletcontext.getrequestdispatcher

10091243
textview	imageview
the textview and imageview in your string homepage_content area are nested in their parent linearlayout and have weights assigned

10091290
portrait	landscape
the user has to rotate the ipad to landscape himself to make things look good again and will then be unable to rotate back to portrait as expected

10091333
hide	fadeout
you could also use fadeout instead of hide if you want to get really fancy

10091418
client-side	server-side
because credentials handles are used to store configuration information the same handle cannot be used for both client-side and server-side operations

10091437
opencv	emgucv
since emgucv is a opencv wrapper i search opencv functions and i ve found the following c++ functions

10091470
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing this through the url bar of my browser and have tried both google-chrome and firefox both yielding the same results

10091494
int	chars
nickmsg is a chars table and i is an int

10091523
post	get
my question is how to get the session cookies after sending the post request

10091583
maven	m2e
if you are using maven and m2e plugin maven should be able to do that automatically

10091597
google-chrome	firefox
please visit if you see it in internet explorer and firefox the content will show up but in google-chrome the whole screen goes black

10091623
put	get
this design explicitly and clearly asks the consumer to only update the ids of the person but i m concerned that the object graph for a put patch looks different than the get making the api hard to learn and remember

10091636
jflex	cup
i have come up with idea using jflex as lexical analyzer and cup as parser

10091671
cookiemanager	urlconnection
try using the same cookiemanager object with your first and subsequent requests using urlconnection

10091686
stdout	fflush
the initial requirement was that this be a vb.net cgi executable - but during testing i havent been able to use the stream from the vb.net executable until the app finishes - like it wasn t able to fflush the stdout even though i was specificly using the console.out.flush

10091687
width	height
i want to create simple script that will be resize loaded image using css width and height

10091716
put	get
also not sure if syntax is good since i didn t put this through compiler but you get the idea

10091737
lxml	elementtree
when i use elementtree from lxml to parse such a document i have no problems the tree is correctly built

10091768
serializable	deserialization
this means adding custom methods for the serializable and deserialization of objects

10091788
postgresql	mysql
i m using mysql but answers valid also for other postgresql oracle etc

10091792
postgresql	mysql
postgresql 9.1 introduced the new function concat_ws much like the one in mysql with which we can further simplify

10091806
google-chrome	firefox
the code prints directly to firefox google-chrome console

10091806
google-chrome	firefox
as you will see the message handler is called in firefox but not google-chrome

10091807
hide	show
in my app when the virtual keyboard appears it is pushes up my menu from the bottom and it is not so nice and it is also cover some of the content so i just hide it when the virtual keyboards show up

10091807
hide	show
but when i press back to hide the keyboard i want to show my menu again but nothing happens except the virtual keyboard disappears like default

10091839
post	get
you re trying to pass the saveuser-parameter as get and the other as post maybe that confuses your serverside part

10091853
tablet	galaxy
in short the requests work fine with android 4.0.3 api 15 the most current but not for android 2.3.3 api 10 which is what i need to be compatible for a galaxy tablet

10091857
hide	show
assumption above code is assuming that you want to hide show the jquery default close button that you see it in the dialog s title

10091879
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put .

10091882
post	get
whenever you asign a an element as a jquery object to a variable you don t need to recall that elements id and if you do recall it by id and get undefined then you ddn t actually post your dynamic html to the dom yet or the id was not established correctly

10091905
post	put
since i didnt read your code am going to post the one which they have put in the documentation

10091914
google-chrome	firefox
the same code works great on firefox 3.6.27 and google-chrome 18.0.1025.151

10091951
ostringstream	std
you could use std ostringstream

10092004
margin	height
so i used an old technique where you basically use a wrapper with 100 height then give it a negative margin and a positive padding corresponding to the constant height value

10092004
margin	height
the combination of a negative margin and a positive padding will result in an empty space with the same height as the content with a fixed height

10092013
versioning	upgrade
should i just upgrade the jars to spring 3.1.1 or another versioning

10092037
jquery	scriptaculous
the most interesting feature of the 3.0 version is that you can use together jquery bubble popup plugin with any other libraries and javascript frameworks like scriptaculous mootols or prototype because the plugin is completely encapsulated to prevent incompatibility problems

10092045
jobs	cron
i m a moderate to good php programer and have experience with terminal shell scripts but what i m trying to wrap my head around is the logics behind background processes and is most certainly not cron or cron jobs but a continual flow of data

10092060
put	get
in my opinion you should stay with the same structure for both get and put requests

10092075
addclass	removeclass
it will better if you put your styles to classes and manipulate with jquery through classes addclass class and removeclass class

10092084
packets	pcap
i have captured some packets using pcap library in c

10092107
hide	show
do not make as southshoreak suggests rather in javascript make it hide or show -

10092122

suddenly when apache cxf-jaxrs + jackson + jaxb tries to ummarshall my incoming json user object in an http put it calls user.setpassword ... and i get the following error

is there any way to do this with powermockito and easymock

10092248
slideup	slidedown
slidedown and slideup won t help

10092253
folder	directory
core relates back to the mage_core_block_core class under the app code core mage core directory and then the info after the slash relates to the folder inside of that directory

10092268
post	get
i ll post the final code to that question when i get it working

10092333
jtextfield	jeditorpane
i have a jeditorpane with a custom html document not from url inside a jscrollpane and a jtextfield so that the user can enter text that will then be highlighted in the editor pane

10092404
express	node.js
i m coding a small api in node.js express for my spine.js application

10092440
requestfactory	gwt-rpc	requestfactory	gwt
anyway when crafting your own headers you should add a prefix to avoid conflicts with other things on the network adding headers something like myapp-date or x-myapp-date like gwt does it with x-gwt-permutation and x-gwt-module-base in gwt-rpc and requestfactory

10092456
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i know google-chrome ie firefox don t allow you to customize this error page and as others have said you d need to have access to the dns server to change this when any browser is used

10092460
ioexception	fileoutputstream	ioexception	fileinputstream	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
when you do your read and write statements on your fileinputstream and fileoutputstream objects resp. an ioexception may arise from the native part if there s a problem in reading or writing from into the file system

10092512
stdout	stderr
from the npgsql source code it looks like it logs directly to stdout stderr or a specified file using the static properties on npgsqleventlog

10092530
gtk	gdk
i have never worked with gtk however looking at gtk programming tips it seems that gdk threads is the most suitable option

10092553
button	checkbox
i m trying to create a toggling checkbox that when a user check the checkbox it will show the button if it s uncheck it will show the disabled version #disablebtn

10092609
h.264	webm
i m working on a system to convert a bunch of .mov files to h.264 using handbrakecli and webm using ffmpeg as the .mov files are created

10092683
comparator	comparable
as you are sorting a number of different types you may want to provide a custom comparator instead or make document implement comparable

10092689
comparator	comparable
if you re trying to sort an array of document s you need to have document implement comparable or pass in a comparator

10092717
express	node.js
check out this tutorial for the image upload portion on the node.js side using express

10092725
voip	sip
unfortunately most of the traffic streams including sip for voip and video is encrypted and sent over tcp

10092725
udp	tcp
so the router has no way to figure out what tcp udp streams does what

10092746
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
then in your table view controller s viewdidappear or viewwillappear call

10092772
maven	pom.xml
while using maven 2 i ve never needed the acme-parent pom.xml at the following location

10092772
maven	pom.xml
in maven 2 when doing builds of child-alpha maven would have no trouble finding acme-parent pom.xml one directory up with a relative path of .. pom.xml so it would never try going to my repositories to find it

10092772
maven	pom.xml
having the parent pom.xml in my local checkout only and not having it in the repo worked fine in maven 2

10092778
hide	show
just a thought but you might accomplish the same result using a hidden textbox and when the user clicks the checkbox you just hide the passwordbox and show the textbox

10092782
mvp	presenter
if the query you are running contains user specific data then i would probably place the results of that query into session within the code which composes the ui part of your application if you are using a pattern like mvc that would be in the controller or mvp in the presenter

10092799
post	get
if you re not able to make it work with that please post the results you get from the items 2 3 both from eclipse and the shell and paste the actual traceback you re getting when running the module

10092832
versioning	upgrade
the windows phone marketplace application will take care of notifying the users when an upgrade versioning of your application is available so you don t have to

10092838
libpcap	wireshark
that way you don t have to care about the details of pcap files and your code will with libpcap 1.1 or later also be able to read at least some of the pcap-ng files that wireshark can produce and that it will produce by default in the 1.8 release

10092838
winpcap	libpcap
writing your own code to read pcap files rather than relying on libpcap winpcap to do so is rarely worth doing

10092912
min	max	minimum	max
define the functions min and max to find the minimum and maximum elements of the list s

10092915
min	max
min and max are a little more complicated.

10092928
thucydides	geb
the best way is to let the frameworks like geb and thucydides abstract out the pageobjects and their initialization

10093482
disk	ram
just to be clear if you have enough ram don t forget that the os wants to have some for disk cache and background activity too this solution will be slower maybe even by a factor of 2 since twice the amount of data needs to be read and written but in case you are swapping to death it might be a lot faster -

10094348
google-chrome	firefox
i mean running this on google-chrome and in firefox opening the page in a tab show the test in 2 seconds while the responses from google-chrome ajax requests come 2 seconds after the last request finished so other browser request has no effect on the first one call that would prove this to be a session problem but see below

programmatically i m able to position things perfectly based on the device width and height

10094403
directwrite	direct2d
directwrite doesn t actually require direct2d and can be used on its own idwritebitmaprendertarget

10094403
directwrite	direct2d
it s just much much easier to use direct2d to render directwrite text into an iwicbitmap via id2d1factory createwicbitmaprendertarget and then draw that bitmap using dx maybe by copying to a dx surface or using some shared surface approach

10094411
udp	tcp
udp gives no guarantee to the received ordering of packets so basically the first packet you recvfrom might be the first packet you sent but must not be - that s what tcp is for which guarantees ordering of received data

what i did was i put my cursor w c also comes from simplecursoradapter to an instance variable instead of a method variable then on my onstop and onpause methods i call stopmanagingcursor then on my onresume and onstart methods i call startmanagingcursor

edit i ve tried and my only override options are equals gethashcode and tostring

10094581
versioning	upgrade
at least in my experience this is also an issue that s likely to change from one versioning of a compiler to the next so even if you don t intend to port to anything else your code may quit working just due to a seemingly trivial upgrade unless you include the right header

10094596
google-chrome	safari
it looks fine in google-chrome safari etc but in ie8 the text is stuck to the top of the input area

10094810
width	margin
to center the div within an element you would set a width and margin with the left and right margins set to auto

10094824
width	height
you could just do 100 for both the width and the height that way it fits the box

10094889
post	get
i have done some googling on this error and have found some post about using autodiscover to get around this

10094969
exponent	modulo
in fact entire groups of users can use the same public exponent each with a different modulo

10094969
exponent	modulo
there are some restrictions on the primes factors of the modulo when the public exponent is fixed. this makes encryption faster than decryption and verification faster than signing

10094969
des	rsa
by comparison des see section 3.2 and other block ciphers are much faster than the rsa algorithm

10094970
directwrite	direct2d
in fact i ve been able to port a bunch of old gdi+ code to using direct2d directwrite and often it s just a line-by-line substitution solidbrush - solidcolorbrush this is in the paint.net 4.0 code base btw

10095069
accurev	svn
it s the same if every team will do their development in the separate branch using svn and trying to merge everything after 1 month of development....basically accurev creates late merge price and you are going to pay this price for ever if you will choose accurev for more than 1 team

10095084
folder	directory
the problem was the directory of the unit test which is not allowed to be the target folder itself

10095131

vbscript	jscript
for example if the default language is jscript you can have a vbscript function fna call a function declared in jscript fnb as long as the call to fna is made as part of the inline execution of jscript

10095192
vbscript	jscript
iow jscript can call into vbscript which in turn can call into vbscript and so on the limiting factor is the engine that the top of this chain must be jscript in this scenario

10095192
vbscript	jscript
in your example code you had code at the global inline level of your vbscript attempting to call a function declared in the default jscript language

10095193
ubuntu	debian
installing software on ubuntu or any debian derivative requires root rights

hopefully this is enough to get the ball rolling on some ideas as to what may be the problem if a video is required to see exactly how the stuttering looks i can put one together and upload it somewhere if need be

10095368
octal	decimal
0153 in octal is 107 in decimal

10095433
haskell	ocaml
note that it currently does not support true parallelism you won t have two threads running ocaml code in parallel but it doesn t matter as ocaml is much faster than many other languages for example on a quadcore the language shootout shows that ocaml outperforms even haskell with multicore capabilities

10095456
dns	spf
i have also activated reverse dns on my hosting account and created an spf dns record that sends email through godaddy only and checked the include ptr box for dns lookup

10095470
post	get
i can not get the hang of the way this site post code

10095506
width	height
even though you gave it a height and width i believe that some browsers don t assign it a real size until you actuall add a shape to it

10095506
google-chrome	firefox
by default it s value is visiblepainted so i really don t know why google-chrome and firefox allow the events to get through

10095525

as stated by other answers neither push nor pull is better but rather you should pick the one that best fits your design needs

10095995
pull	push
from here discussing whether an observer model should be push or pull based

10095996
width	height
i can almost guarantee that it is because you are setting the width and height of the canvas using css width and height and not the html attributes

10095996
width	height
you need to define the width height either in the canvas tag

10096012
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox ie7+ and safari i can use style table-layout fixed in order to force the table columns to certain widths

with divs in google-chrome firefox ie7+ and safari i can use style word-wrap break-word

10096023
listview	gridview	gridview	datalist
it s definitely possible but i would use a listview or datalist as your parent container instead because with a gridview you ll have to put the child list in a column which will look ugly

10096027
width	height
when in landscape you need to reverse width and height

10096027
width	height
remember that the device retains its same height and width your rect just needs to change for the changed orientation

10096116

10096268
hash	salt
if an attacker gets ahold of the data in the datastore as well as our hash salt i m worried they could brute force the sensitive data

10096268
hash	salt
some of it like ssn a 9-digit number does not have a big key space so even with a modern hash algorithm i believe it could be done if the attacker knew the salt

10096293
glassfish	weblogic
weblogic or glassfish are recommended

10096307
free	malloc
so the quick answer to your question is that you can overload operator new delete to use your specific memory allocation scheme via malloc free and the object creation will be taken care of by the generated exectable code

10096338
sorting	filtering
when you need to paginate results you need to also include 2 other aspects of the overall query that will be sent to the database filtering and sorting

10096338
sorting	filtering
the reason why is because unless you also apply both sorting and filtering in combination with paging you will not be able to compute the correct results

10096338
sorting	filtering
ideally you would like to send the db 1 query that applies filtering sorting and pagination to return exactly the paged section you need

10096338
sorting	filtering
if you want to make any part of the query sorting filtering pagesize pagenumber customizable to the user you must pass these values as arguments to the action method

10096348
post	get
since get is to get retrieve data you should use post to post updates to the server deleting a record

10096374
calloc	malloc
you should also test using malloc instead of calloc

i found in attempting to dynamically alloc init a view controller for use like this i had to call initwithnibname bundle and thus i had to put my view controller in a separate xib class so it didn t get confused in the storyboard and leave warnings about an unreachable scene

10096577

seems like jar takes the bytes from the text file and stores exactly those bytes in the jar war file without storing any encoding information

10096777
ant	maven
i m pretty used to maven and its system for dependencies at this point and find our old ant way of doing things pretty messy and hard to maintain

10096777
ant	maven
with that said basically everywhere i seem to look online people are building solr with ant and the few tutorials i found for doing things with maven are all along the lines of this one which doesn t seem to work

10096815

one thing about navigatorcontent assuming your children are a subset of one of these types of containers to remember along with their halo counterparts is they all have a content creation policy set to deferred - meaning it creates the parent most layer of the view viewstack but not it s children until the user has actually navigated to that particular child

the uitapgesturerecognizer has a view properties which it inherited from it s parent

10102458
toolbar	tabs
although it may not look quite the same visually i would suggest looking at wxtoolbook which puts tabs in a toolbar and would solve your problem you could use the gettoolbar method to insert your own toolbar items

10102458
toolbar	tabs
if that wasn t close enough visually to what you are looking to achieve i would suggest deriving a new control from wxbookctrlbase and then creating a tab control with custom drawn tabs which you could add to the toolbar using wxtoolbar addcontrol

memcached	apc
should a simple apc memcached entry be enough or would it require a more stable and persistant storage method also implying an extra sql query or file write on every login

10102480
memcached	apc
i originally thought that a cache storage apc memcached would be enough to store the counter but i m fearing that the cache could fail for what reason making this defense layer ineffective

10102521
min	max
you could do min max on the dates like described here for numbers and just add a counter for the messages

10102521

just want to mention i used mysql as an example it can be anything oracle postgresql

10102844
super	extends
to make o long story not too much longer i am back with my previous solution the extends classes are copying the superclass constructor and provide separate tokenizers that simply call their own constructor that calls the super constructor

10102844
super	abstract
getplace will call an abstract method that returns t and the concrete implementation will call the concrete constructor that also only calls the super constructor

10102893
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in other versions of ie and on google-chrome firefox safari

10102914

in that case you can t use ccactiontween because it only works on built-in data types like bool chars int float double but not c structs

10102930
google-chrome	safari
you can actually do this using -webkit-background-clip text but the text value is proprietary and currently only implemented in webkit based browsers safari and google-chrome

10103084
int	double
you can easy convert float variable to int variable or double to long using such code in c#

10103086

10103087
punctuation	words
on second pass i should get out everything except those two words and punctuation for ex

i d use a sitekey as you d put this in your web.config and it s better to abstract this away into a random string or guid to make it harder to accidentally load someone else s config the client can change their name and you don t get confused in the future as you didn t use their old name as a key etc etc

10103310
dbcontext	objectcontext
when using dbcontext in a database-first scenario i found out that adding and deleting entities is very slow compared to objectcontext

10103310
dbcontext	objectcontext
if adding 2000 entities and saving the changes at the end dbcontext is 3 to 5 times slower than objectcontext btw. i know that adding a large amount of entities would be better using sqlbulkcopy but that s not the point

10103310
dbcontext	objectcontext
when it comes to deletion it even gets worse when saving at the end of all entity removals dbcontext is around 18 times slower than objectcontext

currently if a value is typed into a q double spinbox which is out of its range typing 100 when max is 90 the value is rejected and instead the last valid value is placed back into the spinbox

10103986
range	minimum
i want to change this behavior to allow typing out-of-range values which will be automatically corrected to either the minimum or maximum because otherwise it would be stupidly hard for the user to guess the value range

since my initial fade out was intended to handle the event that multiple views had somehow become unhidden which was happening a lot for other reasons use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout i decided it would be better to try to just immediately kill anything that s in the process of fading from a previous call then do my regular fading

public	protected
basically this is implicit and in your case there is no ambiguity there could be if you had a parameter with the same name or a protected public field in a super class

10105216
width	height
now you can easily get the tile coordinates by using modulo operations on the shifted mouse coordinates with the tile s width and height

ember.js	backbone.js
but on the other hand although new the ember.js package is actually more complete imo than backbone.js

10105437
ember.js	backbone.js
both give you the ability to implement things in a variety of ways which can be confusing but ember.js provides more of the code that you would have to write yourself in backbone.js as standard which for me personally is more important for rapid prototyping than the wealth of backbone.js examples available

10105437
ember.js	backbone.js
there are more mature plugings for data persistence for backbone.js but there is a great community buzz around ember.js and lots of contrib libraries are making great progress

10105437
ember.js	backbone.js
if you wanted to do more with code re-use on both client and server side then take a look the recently open sourced yahoo mojito running on node.js - i ve been messing around with it over the last week and if you become familiar with backbone.js ember.js or any of the others its a snap to get to grips with

your test isn t testing for post or post vs get it is testing for post specifically you could have a case issue there.

however using the 100 height of parent and then adding a margin padding stretches the div to 100 + margin + padding

chore since you have to be wary of client-side handling and da a server-side verification regardless of what the client does

and setting a breakpoint on the get accessor of the set-post cmdlet s title properties results in the following stack trace

10108504
fadein	hide	hide	show
you could use get to grab the number of li elements and if the are more than 3 you could use hide fadein or a selection of other jquery techniques to display your show more link

10108504

the show more could be in a span with an id so you could hide it

10108520

you can try adding box-sizing border-box onto any elements which you want to have 100 height and padding at the same time

most significantly i now subclass directly from qgraphicspixmapitem instead of qgraphicsitem

10108792
children	parent
if all the children declare the same dependency it is a good idea to declare that dependency in the parent instead

10108792
children	parent
i imagine they were thinking the advantage of locally declared dependencies in projects when they are different from sibling projects was nicer to have than restrict the parent to declare all dependencies for all its children

10108792

remember too that maven parent pom.xml files can also have parents

i need to send a lot of information to the server so a get is not enough for me that is why i needed to post the data

10112869
post	get
so you can either to a regular post get or do a little work around

10112889
fixed-point	fractions
it looks like o gives the fractions part of the result as a fixed-point number

10112903
setinterval	settimeout
if you read the time once and depend on the setinterval or and settimeout for the accuracy then yes

10112906
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication	division	multiplication
this works because moving 5 one digit over is the same as multiplying by 10 and multiplication division are commutative the order can be swapped around so 1666.666.

10112932
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval instead of settimeout seems to stick better

10112940
post	get
but if you insist you can use jquery to post the data to the second page instead of using get and then on the server asp side echo the post variable value into javascript

10112963

i tried it in ie9 and the content was still there the second time just the same as in google-chrome and opera

10113004
button	checkbox
i then assign this bitmapdrawable to various button checkbox whatever comes up and needs a certain color

10113039

10113122
int	boolean
org.hibernate.exception.sqlgrammarexception comparisons between boolean and int are not supported

10113127
content-length	content-type
additional http headers such as content-length or content-type can help the browser process the response more efficiently but if you start setting lots of these you re basically implementing your own http server and i d recommend using jetty or something else off the shelf before going down this route

10113134
min	max
the min and max for price i am having trouble implementing

10113134
min	max
in the view i have a corresponding drop down lists for the viewbags min and max

check out urllib.parse.parse_qs parsing a query-string form data sent to server by get or form data posted by post at least for non-multipart data

10113217
solaris	bsd
while this should be an obvious way to do it if you re on a unixish operating system linux bsd solaris os x etc -- though i don t think macs have had serial ports in a few decades it s not immediately clear or obvious if you can just ask windows to open com1 and have it work correctly

10113231
overwrite	preserve
which should make it so that your local changes are preserve as long as they are not one of the files that you are trying to force an overwrite with

10113241
dbcontext	objectcontext
maybe that in itself would not be a problem if somehow you would succeed in dynamically generating an objectcontext dbcontext

10113307
for-loop	arrays
i asked a previous question about declaring an arrays in a for-loop

10113359
width	height

put	get
it seems i am unable to put a where clause on the include in my domain service - so we are doing some loops to get the data we need for some lookupgroups

10113369
wordpress	expressionengine
but in my opinion for most sites expressionengine is a better choice than wordpress

10113385
spaces	delimiter
for example the various configurable file extensions must each start on a new line - not delimiter by spaces

10113393
width	height
the height and width in the code are set to a value that is big enough so that nothing of my reports is hidden

10113435
width	height
so how i can do the green has the same width as red and red too but whit different content whit height auto

10113515

register a mouseenter and mouseleave on all pages

10114039

obviously activex controls are never going to work in all browsers since they contain native x86 code though there are some windows-only extensions for both firefox and google-chrome that seem to add some kind of support for activex controls

10114089
int	chars
i went in a completely different direction then tim i like his better though my approach works on a mixed vector that s a chars vector with int etc.

10114096
post	get
you need to actually submit the form post or pass the parameters in the url get to get the request parameters via the request object

10114096
post	put
in submitme.aspx put this for a post click the button

10114096
post	put	post	get	put	get
in barcodes.aspx.vb put this in page_load works for either the get or post option

10114118
children	parent
since you know the parent and children size its really easy

10114136
for-loop	arrays
then inside that if we use a for-loop since you re stuck on arrays and null check it

10114162
public	protected
the application works with a sql database and it has a public usernam and password protected and a private windows integrated security front-end

i m currently trying to dive into racket scheme a bit

10114306
rss	feed
but it is shown in the rss feed as

10114351
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are two different things

10114351
udp	tcp
one to handle tcp connections and the other to handle udp connections

10114351
udp	tcp
however if it is absolutely necessary to use both tcp and udp protocols then i suggest multithreading the server so that it listens for both types of connections and accepts them both

10114368
instances	transient
i m using a scoped unit of work so that all the handler dependencies using it will share the same instances thx to the child container btw i ve setup the unit of work as transient thinking that the child container will treat all transient object as singleton within that container but i saw that the unit of work wasn t shared so this is why it s setup as scoped

10114384
ant	maven
i was a little concerned when i saw your phrase ported the entire project to netbeans 7.1.1 personally i would advise that your project should be built using a build tool that was ide agnostic such as ant or maven

sqlite and postgresql are just as limited as mysql and though i have limited experience with nosql systems my research gives me the impression that they excel at scalability not performance of the kind i need

10114577
width	height
i want to make an algorithm that will take an image its width and height and construct a terrain node out of it

10114581
sorting	filtering
the most advantages of the beforeprocessing approach you will see if you would use loadonce true option and use local sorting or filtering of the data

10114613
capistrano	bundler
use gemsets or bundler exec capistrano .

10114638
post	get
i am working on a project where i need to be able to get gmt time using jquery and post it into a mysql db through php

10114654
inherited	subclassing
as for why object itself does not have a slot for __dict__ well even if a subclassing indicated that they didn t need the __dict__ slot if they inherited from a class that does then the instance must still have a __dict__

10114711
try-catch	exception-handling
i am running almost the whole program in a super try-catch block so i can log any unhandled exception-handling

10114873
put	get
i m trying to get this vertical list to load the document titles i put inside the load_content during an onclick event

10114924
getter	setter
however the only place you want to access them with the underscore is in the implementation of the getter setter for the property

10114926
rss	feed
this results in a .xml rss feed being created however everything is in it s own individual and which causes trouble

10114933
post	get
get api v1 me post

10114933
post	get
so i want to achieve the same results either using get api v1 me post or get api v1 users fred_flintstone post

10114947
hash	salt
more secure way is taking a hash of some salt and the personal data you specified

10114988
children	parent
the main.js which contains titlebar calls all the other panels since the other panels are children of the main.js where the titlebar is so the children are not able to set the background color of the parent

10114991
atexit	main
you can add your own atexit logging function that will do stuff set a flag so that it only does stuff if exit happens abnormally then set the flag just before leaving main

10115010
tunnel	packets
this means the browsers running on browserling s servers can send packets down the tunnel back to your localhost and your webserver there

10115054
g++	gcc
according to this page on gcc s website range-based for is only available in g++ 4.6 and up so you ll have to convert your code to a normal for-loop or use std for_each or something or upgrade your compiler

10115058
post	get
for example if you need to stay stateless and bookmarkable you should pass your arguments in a stateless way via post or get maybe using pageparameters

10115079
realloc	malloc
so the amount of memory malloc d realloc d to hold the heap should be roughly 2 n sizeof struct elt

10115079
free	malloc
that should further reduce the amount of memory malloc ed and free d

10115138
client-side	server-side
also note that although client-side validation improves the user experience it does not protect against malicious attacks so you may still want some server-side validation in addition

10115162
mouseout	mouseleave
but mouseout and mouseleave both cause the larger image to instantly fadeout

10115172
cpython	pypy
however in the one microbenchmark i ve tried comparing pypy and cpython pypy was quite a bit faster than cpython

10115188
onfocus	onblur
what i thought about doing was using onfocus to capture what the content was when the user onfocuses and then checking it against this.value onblur to see if anything has changed

10115211
udp	tcp
don t forget to allow connections to sql server browser on udp port 1434 apart form the db instance port on tcp

10115216
hash	md5
md5 does not encrypt a password it hash it

10115216
hash	md5
md5 hash are 128 bits

10115230
hash	md5
when mysql converted your string md5 hash to an integer or tried to it exceeded the max value an integer can hold so it saved the max integer instead

10115235
gtk	clutter
so i was just wondering how i might be able to achieve this using clutter or gtk

10115239
submit	submission
if you even want to prevent this submission a score would have to go like this request random id number from server hash score + id + password submit the score + hash the server then checks whether this hash is good

10115244
mousemove	mouseleave
you might need to make a mousemove event that sees if the mouseleave the boundaries of the original div

10115248
width	height
realistically all i want is a very short macro that resizes the width of the image by x pixels and does nothing else - but as with any other resize macro i keep getting the height weirdness

10115253
children	parent
i am working with an older navigation system that uses jquery + css to expand the vertical menu parent - children

10115257
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
however in this tutorial the uipageviewcontroller is instantiated programmatically within a class that extends uiviewcontroller

10115272
post	put
they are picking up the letter you put in the mailbox sending it to mom mom is writing her reply and the post office is bringing it back to you

10115284

10115322
centos	linux
i m having hard time trying to setup an ssl certificate it s a comodo positivessl purshased from namecheap on my ec2 micro instance i m using amazon linux ami 2012.3 which is based on centos if i m not mistaken

put	get
put this all together and we get a statement similar to this

10115393
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
please view the below code as html in both firefox and other browsers such as google-chrome or safari

10115409
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
rather convoluted calling sequence but the first issue i see is that it looks like you re calling pushviewcontroller on an onbviewcontroller not on its navigationcontroller

10115461
width	height
you can use to generate thumbnail of fixed size all you need to do it set your desired height and width

10115470
google-chrome	firefox
well i have tried something like this with firefox and google-chrome

10115495
stdout	stderr
if you want to get absolutely everything both stdout and stderr you need to redirect stdout from system.out and stderr from system.err

10115495
stdout	stderr
note that java buffers system.out so if you log both stdout and stderr to the same file you could end up with nonsensical output that has the two printstreams interwoven or something in stdout could be printed much later than a related message that was printed to stderr

10115538
serializable	deserialization
the preparemetadataforserialization method on base configures the runtimemodel for protobuf.net but i mentioned earlier the serializable and deserialization works fine outside of the wcf so i think the dtos are ok

10115557
cpu	processors
on my machine this gives me all sorts of devices sound card pci and usb processors so i m not sure if there is a better way to just get the cpu but i did get the info what cpu i have

10115588
getter	setter
when referring to internal private variables of java pojos that have getter setter i ve used the following terms

10115617
factors	matrix
lastly try to cheat the conditioning on your matrix by multiplying the diagonal by a factors like 1.0001

10115625
getter	setter
it does not mean there is a getter and a setter

10115625
getter	setter
property is the getter and setter combination

10115631
margin	height
surround the entire thing with a container div of the fixed height which you desire with no padding and inside that place another inner div with no margin and no fixed height then as the user changes the content create a javascript function to check if the inner div is the container div

10115656
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to query my database using a an arrays that increments in a for-loop

10115677
for-loop	arrays
i have an arrays that i want to rename so that the values are stored depending on what number the for-loop is on

10115700
jruby	mri
i have had success using mri for my development tdd cycles and switching to jruby using rvm to make sure everything still runs

10115714
ubuntu	linux
i ve compiled an ada program for linux on ubuntu 5.4 gnat 3.4 using the following command

10115768
for-loop	arrays
i have this code that executes a for-loop in javascript with a php arrays inside of it

10115802
width	height
they are only visible within the stage i ve set with specific height and width

10115869
user-controls	tabcontrol
the tabcontrol sets its size according to the user-controls size

10115891
rsa	dsa
i created both an rsa key and dsa key

10115891
rsa	dsa
i guess rsa is older and dsa is newer

10115901
post	get
but in my groups case i need to specify parameters such as all in people all to get all people or group id in people groups id to specify where to post a new person

10115913
put	get
i have worked out how to do the foreach and get every result but i put in the following code and just get a blank page

10116027
for-loop	arrays
i m thinking of writing a method that contains a for-loop that goes through each value in the arrays that the table view is pulled from and adds only those with the correct accessory type to a new arrays

10116038
getter	setter
and adjust your getter setter accordingly

10116068
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i ve noticed that i can place this in viewwillappear and viewdidappear with slightly different results

10116105
post	get
use union to combine all the post from different tables then use the in clause to get all the userid s you want to follow based on the current userid

10116109
public	protected
if the abstract method only implements some piece of a greater functionality that is available from a public method in your abstract class then it should probably be protected

10116110
set	bag
the resource should remain alive as long as either there s at least one wrapper object in the bag whose valid flag is set or the resource itself holds a reference to a valid wrapper

10116134
post	get
this will work the same using post instead of get

10116144
google-chrome	firefox
but i m having issues on google-chrome and firefox - they both trigger the error callback with the slight difference that on google-chrome my controller action doesn t even get hit at all it does on firefox though

10116187
google-chrome	firefox
when the page generates it shows the code properly in the view source option of google-chrome and firefox but when i do inspect element it shows this

10116196
public	protected
here is the difference for public protected and private

10116196
public	protected
for method if you set public it can be accessed to all classes within all packages in your project if you set protected it just can be accessed to all classes within same package or sub class that extend the abstract class

10116200
google-chrome	safari
jquery offers cross-browser compatibility compare to keyframe which is only supported in safari and google-chrome

10116200
google-chrome	safari
if you don t want your users to be limited only to google-chrome and safari you should definitely consider jquery

10116205
getter	setter
create getter and setter for all properties in the config

10116220
submit	submission
the additional values that appear to be injected on submission are simply the x and y coordinates where the you clicked on the image to submit the form

10116220
submit	submission
when you use javascript to submit the form you do not click on the image which is why the x and y values are not included on form submission

10116242
free	malloc
the apparent corruption would happen because type or foo points at already free memory which malloc gives back to you for a different use

10116242
strdup	malloc
you should check the allocations from strdup and malloc to ensure that you got memory allocated

10116280
textview	imageview
each listview have 1 imageview and 2 textview

10116315
google-chrome	firefox
it works in all other browsers firefox google-chrome etc except ie7

10116322
disk	ram
it allocates virtual addresses and the kernel is responsible for keeping track of where the pages are actually stored in physical ram or on disk

10116322
free	malloc
so the pages remain allocated to your program from the kernel standpoint even though they re free space from the malloc standpoint

10116338
getter	setter
i created a property for the nsarray which creates a getter setter

10116363
put	get
the primary problem with sending byte s over web services is that they get put in the soap body which is gets encoded as a base 64 string

10116368
free	malloc
this means that each subarray needs to be malloc d and free d individually

10116389
retaincount	dealloc
if your array s retaincount is greater than 1 at the start of dealloc some other object is retaining it at least temporarily

10116435
getter	setter
perl libraries for example often use a getter and setter

10116466
post	put
i ll be sure to post it later as it is getting kinda late and i m gonna put this down for the night

10116549
put	get
i m trying to put together a quick web service test just to see if i can get it to work for now

10116607
x86	64bit
i believe common x86 architectures will allow allocations of continuous physical memory in powers of two from 16 bytes to 4 mb though i m on a 64bit machine

10116625
put	get
a quick way to get it down by a factor of 10 or so is to create a column for string length put an index on it and use it in the where clause

10116703
feof	getchar
feof stream is probably wrong because feof does not predict a future eof it tells you only why a previous read-attempt failed why getchar returned eof

10116719
hide	show
then in cellforrowatindexpath create the cell then depending on the actual requirement show hide the subviews that makes up a book or a movie

10116719
hide	show
so if your layout varies you can still put them in one place and use frame or show hide to control cell behavior

10117221

width	height
i have tried above options but there are few problems with them like adjusting the height and width of the pop-up window changing some other properties also

10117609
pop-up	dialog
i tried jquery dialog box and then i got an idea to create a div element and place your html content in div and you just need to set its z-index to very high level and append it to body section and see it will work as a pop-up and now you can easily set up the properties for your div or pop-up

10117609
hide	show
i used show and hide method whenever i wanted my pop up to be displayed

10117641
width	height
you need is to compare the ratios of the width and height scales of the content and the target

dbscan visits each point once so there is next to no benefit from using a distance matrix except the symmetry gain

10118026
width	height
i noticed that i cannot choose any width and height combo i want for the spotify play button

10118026
width	height
if i use the generator tool and increase the width it automatically increases the height field to match some arbitrary aspect ratio

10118026
width	height	min	max
so i can never truly get the exact width and height i need even within the min and max values specified on the developer page

10118026
width	height
what i need is a width of 440px and height of 720px

10118026

10118237
nswindow	nsprogressindicator
essentially i have a nsprogressindicator that spins on the bottom corner of the nswindow

10118237
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller

10118366
equals	compareto
equals and compareto have to do the same thing

10118366
equals	compareto
that is if equals returns true compareto should return 0 and vica versa

10118370
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
first of all you have to convert your string date to java.util.date than you have to use java.util.calendar to manipulate dates

10118419
equals	compareto
i suggest that you either change the equals â compareto and hashcode method to take name and age into account

10118420
subtract	add
then use the calendar arithmetic functions to add subtract

10118422
move	drag
drag drop you would propably need to do as two fingers on tablet click with left and leave the left finger on tablet and then raise right finger and move left finger so it could be interpreted as drag drop

10118435
fseek	fread
i am wondering if the processing time of fseek is the same as fread

10118466
sorting	filtering
the various filtering and sorting options chosen in the view should return different lists from the store

10118483
fseek	fread
fseek just repositions the internal file pointer whereas fread actually reads data

10118483
fseek	fread
so i guess fseek should be much faster than fread

10118485
fseek	fread
i am wondering if the processing time of fseek is the same as fread

10118485
fseek	fread
an fseek to file position 149m followed by a 1m fread will probably be faster than 150 different 1m fread calls throwing away all but the last

10118497
int	chars
this function takes an int that describes one line of the 3x5 matrix and converts it into a line of random chars

10118547

int	boolean	int	double
the nsuserdefaults class provides convenience methods for accessing common types such as floats double int boolean and urls

nsstring	nsdata
a default object must be a property list that is an instance of or for collections a combination of instances of nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

10118627
nscolor	nsfont
this limitation would seem to exclude many kinds of objects such as nscolor and nsfont objects from the user default system

10118668
int	chars
i also think of to use 5 bytes instead but than i need to take care of the different type of number one int + one chars is there any library in c++ can easily do the coding compressing for me

10118678
spaces	linefeed
mind the blocks that break a single textnode with linefeed and spaces before an html tag into three nodes spaces only textnode commentnode and textnode with html tag

10118683
width	height
and the div will have a height and width not a blank div any more

10118700
equals	compareto
so your compareto method should check if two person are equals by name first and if they are not check their age

unfortunately the streams get mixed on some lines the characters from stdout and stderr are mixed together in single line

10118711

10118728
min	max
use my roundto50 function to round of the min and max limits to the nearest 50

10118746
int	chars
the following example program fread s the first datasize sets of a chars an int and a float from a file specified on the command line

10118754
pull	push
which is similar to the manual process described in propagate a remote location via clone push pull

10118755
put	get
if two instances are trying to do this simultaneously then one will get an exception and will need to retry get the data again increment put all in transaction

10118760
uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller
then you can present separate pages as you want in a uiscrollview with a uipagecontrol much better a uipageviewcontroller

10118802
freebsd	linux
if jot is on your system then i guess you re running freebsd or osx rather than linux so you probably don t have tools like rl or sort -r available

10118832
rss	feed
i m using dotnetnuke dnn website version 5.6.2 and using news feed rss module in that

10118894
ant	maven
the same book-keeping information might not necessarily be needed to build the project - whether this is done by ant or maven - but have to be present nevertheless

10118894
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
both ant and maven have their own ways to represent the same information build.xml and pom.xml and to some extend the synchronization between the different forms can be automated.

10118914
firepath	firebug
i should also add that firebug firepath evaluates all the above successfully

10118975
fseek	fread
i probably feel fseek might be bit faster than fread as fseek changes the pointer position to the new address space that you have mentioned and there is no date read is happening

10119005
postgresql	mysql
the solution you gave me seems clear for the question but the problem is a little bigger the two tables presents different kinds of variables and it should be that they are one in mysql with the user data drupal default for users then i have 2 in postgresql both with the same primary key id_user

10119007
n-gram	words
i need to have the n-gram by rankings for example how many times a certain words shows up in a series of emails by a person

10119241
post	get

children	parent
each of these data classes only contain references to instances for their children not their parent for their parent they only contain the id

10119407
hide	show
you could just give the elements you wish to hide a class and have them hidden by default using css then just show them once the link is clicked

10119477
keydown	mousedown
the events you should use are previewmousedown or mousedown not keydown

10119498
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the problem is if i put the arrays inside a for-loop between do and done and when i try to print the arrays length outised loops i.e after done the values are not getting updated

10119499
switching	screens
effects like switching screens or slide screens in an activity with animations using viewflipper in android

10119707
graphviz	gephi
so readers may wish to know what toolsets each have - i am encouraged that gephi uses grahml and obviously dotml has the graphviz and other toolsets

10119710
mouse	keyboard
apparently this caused the inner div and thus the form to not receive any keyboard or mouse events at all

10119734
google-chrome	safari
you can use this technique to style the scrollbar however it only works in webkit browsers google-chrome safari

10119750

10119944

10119976
serializable	deserialization
i m writing an embedded c++ program and need to add serializable deserialization

10119976
serializable	deserialization
while yaml-cpp has the exact functionality i d like the source code is almost 300k and would almost double my code size which seems excessive to me just in order to add human readable serializable deserialization

10120189
jstl	taglib
but use jstl taglib instead of using scriptlets

10120192
ant	maven

10120308
oncreate	ondestroy
i have develop one android application which will talk to server 24 7 over wifi but when phone goes to sleep mode it stops talking to server means socket is getting closed so for resolving this i added code to acquire partial wake lock in service oncreate and release it on ondestroy method o service so even though phone goes to sleep mode my application can talk to the server

i m not entirely sure what you mean about needing separate get post methods

10120914

10120965
rss	feed
using rss feed you can have them automatically download updates join the update file swarm as soon as it is released

10120965
rss	feed
however if i am right it sounds like these content updates installation need only have them download to the correct directory which would be something you specify when you re setting up the rss feed to download from in utorrent

10120972

i am from java background and what i infer from objective c documentation is that a property is similar to java bean class one having getter and setter of instance varibles

the other difference is that in objective c you can synthesize properties while in java you need to write your getter and setter manually

10122576
getter	setter
property is a syntactic sugar over a getter method or a pair of a getter and a setter methods

10122595
getter	setter
a property in objective c is in fact the setter and getter methods that make it possible to access an attribute in a class from outside of it

10122701
getter	setter
it s introduced mainly because the complicated getter setter syntax

10122701
getter	setter
it s sort of similar to java s concept of protecting a private variable through getter setter

submit	submission
aside from the fact that the return statement is executed before either of your callback functions success and error are called and it doesn t seem that anything is done with the return value of the click handler function for what may be happening is though you are making an ajax call on the click event the browser is also submission a form post because #submit_login is a submit type button - whether or not an ajax call is being performed the page does a reload on the form submit so it looks as if the click handler is returning false instead of hitting your success handler

we re actually creating objects of both the superclass and the subclassing this is through reflection on a jar sticking them in a map and then pulling them out as we need them but we have verified by printing out the object.getclass .getname and seeing that we are in fact working with the superclass instantiation

10130779
superclass	subclassing

my issue arises whenever a user has an faq answer open activated by the first function and then tries to do a show hide all

the show hide function uses a toggling system so this causes all the questions to toggle including the one that is already showing

10135005
median	max	min	median	min	max
to find the median and left right you probably want to call it to find the median and then just do the max of the components of the array to the left and the min of the components to the right because you know once the median selection phase is done that all elements to the left of the median will be less than it and to the right will be greater or equal

10135212
portrait	landscape
if i m in portrait mode and i present a new modalviewcontroller and then rotate to landscape autoresizing works perfectly and everything looks great

so in theory i could build the select command in such a way that i could filter the data based on the gridview that is binding to the sqldatasource

the problem is that if i use the same sqldatasource for all the gridview i cannot find a way to have each gridview tell the sqldatasource which one is calling it

10135324
portrait	landscape
keeping this in mind when a view is loaded in portrait as all uiviewcontrollers are but the actual orientation is landscape it s possible that the view will get confused and maintain a sort of messy hybrid orientation type view

10135815
ember.js	sproutcore
see ember.js or sproutcore for real world examples of libraries that use this construct

the code that is attempting to upgrade the custom workflow activity assembly is a slightly modified versioning of this

10136151

i ve modified the register function in this file to handle the update vs upgrade scenarios by comparing the major minor portion of the assemblyversion number of the assembly in crm with the versioning number of the assembly i m attempting to upload

10136151
versioning	upgrade
one important thing to note is that i can perform the upgrade using the gui pluginregistrationtool from the sdk just not with this commandline versioning of the tool

10136151
versioning	upgrade
also i get the same error message if i try to import a managed solution with an upgrade versioning of the custom workflow activity assembly on top of a managed solution with an older versioning of the assembly

10136155
hide	show
the middle part would be a richtextbox you can use a visibility converter to toggle hide show if upload is empty

10136173
width	height
when selection increases and more cells are selected the red lines should be the borders of the selection and should mark the whole width in the columnheader and the whole height in the row header

even if pageviewcontroller spinelocationforinterfaceorientation is called there is still one page in both portrait and landscape mode

10137483
superclass	subclassing
the problem is that the superclass contract promises it accepts as a parameter however you expect a tokenringnode specifically which is only of of the classes that so a subclassing of what it promises to accept

10137483
superclass	subclassing
hence your subclassing is accepting less classes than the superclass contract promises

but when i change page and go back i can t slide the min slide after 40 and the max slider under 40 it keeps the value where the conflict was

10137623
getter	setter
my take on this is that the getter setter methods which take url parameters as method arguments are invoked after postconstruct resulting in a bean in an indeterminate state

10137640
min	max
also without the count and sum all the manipulations on max year min year and month are good

10137727

this would have to be done most likely in common.js so that with the exception of the one in a billion user that has never been to the site and manages to navigate directly to the page with the dynamically sized image i hope you re not going to put something like that on your main page that information will already be there when they get to the page

10143559
processors	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading
the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

so in agreement with the comments to your question the simplest solution is to register to mousedown or mouseup which one depends on the behaviour you are looking for the closest behaviour to click would be mouseup

10144155
jlabel	jtextpane

qgraphicstextitem	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicspixmapitem	qgraphicstextitem	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicspixmapitem

for example the mvc3 request and response controller properties were designed specifically to be isolateable injectable versions of httprequest and httpresponse

10145671
nsubstitute	moq
if the differences in test-writing with and without testhelper are sufficiently marginal then i d prefer to forego testhelper...which means i am then free to choose whatever isolation framework i like moq or nsubstitute

10145671
httprequest	httpresponse
ultimately i would be surprised to learn the mvc3 release had taken specific improved testability steps for httprequest and httpresponse but not for the other above listed dependency issues

i would use javascript to assign the height and width equal to document s height and window s width respectively

10146788
post	get
the major issues with this method is that js must be activated for the form to submit properly since your server is expecting post data it probably wouldn t know what to do with get data if the js failed unless you set it up to get both which is probably just as much work as writing the proper html in the first place.

what is happening is that other browsers are incorrectly applying a height of 305px and width of 940px to your #featured division

10147053
width	height
i suppose one way you could work around this is to manually specify the width and height on your #featured element so that all the browsers including chrome act the same

10147054
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
if you inspect the #featured element you ll notice that this element has a height and width set via css inline styles in firefox but not in google-chrome

10147109
multiplying	add
since you know kernel size the fastest way to do this would be to read chunks of the input image signal into shared memory and perform an unrolled multiplying and add operation

10147110
width	height
this is causing the plugin to set a specific height and width to the div where as in chrome no height is set meaning it is still 0

10147125
salt	md5
md5 password + generic salt

10147125
salt	md5
md5 addslashed + generic salt

10147125
hash	md5
if you happen to know that dragon is 8621ffdbc5698829397d97767ac13db3 in md5 you can know the password just by looking at the hash

10147156
ssl	https
i want to be able to change them to use https ssl but i need to be able to use a different key cert for each route

10147186
n-gram	words
i have apps that relate words to other words n-gram and databases that could relate users to other users friends followers

10147291
boost	stl
prefer the stl prefer smart pointers use boost write new and delete only if you really have to and care about exception safety

10147319
google-chrome	firefox
i tested in google-chrome latest version firefox 11 and internet explorer 8

10147323
button	checkbox
i thought of running an .each function that increments a variable when it s blank and have it submit only if the # is less than the # of fields but ideally i m looking for something more generic that will work with checkbox and radio button as well as text inputs and text areas

10147353
int	chars
any variable in int chars etc. is just an array of length 1

10147426
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
raphaã l currently supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ google-chrome 5.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+

10147479
superclass	subclassing
where the subclassing is used in the definition of the superclass

10147479
superclass	subclassing
it s interesting to note that although it s technically allowed it doesn t make sense to have a superclass create a subclassing instance in its constructor

10147496
public	protected
in order to test protected methods you often need to create a proxy class that makes the methods public

10147496
public	protected
in the test case you would create another class and make its protected methods public like so

10147528
ocaml	scheme
the vast majority of languages including c java python ruby javascript scheme ocaml standard ml go objective-c smalltalk etc

10147562

width	height
href javascript parent.popup url testdoc002.html type shared width 700 height 712

10147605
vim	emacs
tamas kovacs has created a vim paredit script similar to the emacs version

10147623
google-chrome	firefox
this works as expected in firefox but for the life of me i can not get it going in google-chrome

10147642
pull	push
that way any new commit push to your repository will be added to the pull request

10147649
free	malloc
to be technically correct wt is a so-called vla or variable length array which is notably only present in c99 which is a c standard which most compilers still don t fully support so you might be wanting to avoid these and use malloc and free

10147667
hide	show
notice when you click yes no another form element show up or hide and the space taken by the element disappears

10147690
for-loop	loops
grades using if-else loops and the following cutoff inside a for-loop

button	checkbox
for example say i want to make my way through a survey and they have several checkbox or radio button

10147721
antialiasing	transparent
i decided against png as the antialiasing was pretty bad with a transparent background and i don t think my site is going to cause too much unwanted attention yet

10147733
qtableview	qsqlquery
it is built on top of the lower-level qsqlquery and can be used to provide data to view classes such as qtableview

10147739
firefox	safari
i know how to customize it for ie but in firefox and safari its still default

10147773
stdout	stderr
of course it will be safer to scan the program s stdout and stderr for expected and unexpected patterns in order to proceed or abort

10147773
stdout	stderr
this would be possible by also setting the stdout and stderr args of popen to subprocess.pipe and calling communicate like this

10147790
for-loop	loops
if he means he needs it in loops then i m guessing that it s an if statement and an else statement inside the for-loop

10147822
ready	each
after each rk step evaluate the acceleration to be ready for the next step

10147930
nsstring	nsdata
the answer that i found out for android was that it was the old server but the new serve still had issues with the ios app but i figured out that if you alloc the nsstring with the nsdata then the information will not have any possiblities of gaining extra data or information

10147978
pop-up	dialog
in my case this reduced the time to pop-up the print dialog from 8 seconds to 0.7 seconds

10147990
umask	mkdir
so i only needed to call mkdir with full permissions and that gets chopped according to current umask

10147991
post	get
maybe it will be the way to go if the app is used enough but it seems like use would drop off and then you couldn t get at the older post easily

10147994
hide	show
the way you re handling it now it just hide and then show with no break in between

10148009
hide	show
i am using jquery to hide a textbox and show it when the user clicks a button

10148009
hide	show
if the user type a text then hide it and show it again the textbox is empty

10148028
yourkit	jprofiler
update 1 yourkit also provides accurate results so this is clearly related to jprofiler

10148040
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it blows my mind that google-chrome firefox ie give you a prompt that says remember password - but from my experience remembering passwords only work as i expect when i am using safari

10148047
stdout	stderr
as a rule error messages should go to stderr instead of stdout

10148105

jasmine	qunit
this allows you to run jasmine qunit tests from a command-line which can then be easily integrated with a tfsbuild using the invokeprocess activity

10148333
oncreate	onstart
ive tried using the onstart method since that gets called after oncreate so i thought the page would be created and displayed and then onstart gets called but that doesnt happen theres still lag between it loading because its getting the data online and then displays the page with it already loaded

10148344

i believe you need to change the calls amin and amax to just be calls to min and max as in my_array.max

10148539
gridview	sqldatasource
i m able to add gridview to my aspx pages and retrieve data using a sqldatasource

10148562
inherited	properties
i ve also verified that it will throw for other methods and properties defined on myclass but not the constructor or system.object inherited methods

10148600
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout
i am not sure why you try to fadeout the div first and fadein the same again and then hide it

10148615
width	height
in chrome v18 i can still see the css being applied which screws up some other functions that depend on the height and width settings from the dynamically loaded css

10148657
filtering	grouping

let s say i make a class with some nice getter and setter

10149344
getter	setter
well i guess i could make another set of getter and setter

10149344
getter	setter
some of the transformations are applicable to more than one variable and i don t want to clutter my classes with getter and setter

10149349
accessor	properties
both of these assume your student class has declared properties or kvc-complient accessor for those fields that is not just instance variables

10149418
getter	setter
anyway as a best practice consider using reflection on public members only so work with getter setter if possible

10149499
jar	manifest.mf
when java runs the jar it will look at manifest.mf file inside the jar s meta-inf directory and will read mainclass attribute in there

10149499

10149832
int	chars
an int is usually represented by 4 bytes while a chars is actually just 1 byte of data

10149832
int	chars
you can easily store a full chars and more in the single int that getchar returns

10149832
int	chars
this technique is useful for passing eof which is actually not a chars at all but an int that signals the end of the file

10149846
disk	ram
using an integer for the foreign keys and accompanying indexes is considerably faster and needs less space on disk and in ram

10149986
int	chars
the type chars is nothing but an int which is in most cases just a 8-bit byte

10149986
int	chars
the type int is an int which is usually wider and so can keep all the possible values a chars can keep

10149986
int	chars
if on your system char_bit is 16 sizeof chars 1 by definition but sizeof int could be 1 too

you need to put braces around the pointer dereference in the second printf also if you re attempting to get number 2 in your list there you need to use the prefix increment rather than postfix

10150456
int	double
if your method returns an object you re going to have to cast at some point or another to use the class specific functions of int double etc

10150524

2 set the setweightsum of the parent layout sum of the weights of the children

10151342
dictionary	map
it suggests that you set add a south_migration_modules dictionary in settings.py and map that app to a nonexistent module

10151344
hash	md5
good hash function md5 sha1 etc. makes this collision nearly impossible to happen so it only depends whether it is fast enough for your purpose

10151357
subtraction	add
to keep at least a little challenge i ve assumed we can t do subtraction directly so we have to negate the number ourselves using twos complement so flip the bits and add one

10151382
keydown	keyup
first monitor keydown instead of keyup event

for hashing itself you don t want it to be fast â see key derivation functions like pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt

10151817
nscoding	nscopying
i followed the example code to conform this class to nscoding and nscopying

10151850
hash	salt
the hash is incorrect generated differently or with different salt

10151850
hash	salt
anyway for each new password hash saved generate a new random salt value like say 128 bits or more

10151850
hash	salt
this one-of-a-kind nonce is then used to salt the password before it is hash

10151850
hash	salt
the hash and the salt are then saved together they are often combined into a value but it s okay if they are in separate columns

10151850
hash	salt
find the row representing the user first and extract the hash and salt

10151850
hash	salt
generate the hash from the password using the salt

10151850
hash	salt
if hash salt was saved as a combined value separate it first as needed

10151850
hash	salt
that is the query should likely not search for where password should really be called hash or similar because the salt needs to be available to generate the correct hash again

10151850
hash	salt
this is not the correct way to do it and requires that each one of the potential salt is used in the hash generation so the right hash can be found

10151850
hash	md5
in addition do not use md5 for password hash

10151885
google-chrome	firefox

so now if this locationlistener is not recreate after the oncreate call it will reference the old activity and a call to findviewbyid will return objects hold by that old activity

10152066
width	height
invisible elements can t trigger a mouseover event because they have no width and height and therefore no place in the document to be hovered

10152137
typedef	struct
or the typedef struct node_s to

10152144
int	double

ant	maven
this kind of deployment directory structure is very popular and have adopted by many brilliant apps like maven and ant

10152255
stdout	stderr
the output you re seeing is both from stderr the gcc error message and stdout the rest of it

10152255
stdout	stderr
stdout is usually buffered while stderr generally isn t so the order in which they appear on your screen isn t an indicator of the order of execution of your code

processors	hyperthreading
to determine if hyperthreading is enabled for the processors compare numberoflogicalprocessors and numberofcores

10152495
processors	hyperthreading
if hyperthreading is enabled in the bios for the processors then numberofcores is less than numberoflogicalprocessors

10152495
processors	hyperthreading
for example a dual-processor system that contains two processors enabled for hyperthreading can run four threads or programs or simultaneously

10152710
minimum	diagonal
one solution i d accept would be to create a euclidean distance matrix and shuffle the rows to get the minimum of a function the summed squares of the distances on the diagonal or other heuristic

10152710
minimum	diagonal
swapping rows 3 and 4 gives the minimum sum of the diagonal

10152712
vim	emacs
it does this adaptively and works even in full-screen programs like emacs and vim

10152719
maven	pom.xml
so whenever a pom.xml declares an external dependency maven tries to the get the jar files from the proxy

10152719
peer	p2p
as a workaround we were thinking that if it were possible to install a p2p plugin in maven then whenever a jar file is required maven could first check peer for example local maven repo of the developer sitting next to me before hitting the internal maven proxy

10152721
flask	django
i worked with django it is cool but i want to try flask

10152721

basic question but i expected this struct to occupy 13 bytes of space 1 for the chars 12 for the 3 unsigned int

10153161
g++	gcc
i guess you are using the gcc g++ in this case says that header paths are searched from left to right meaning the first path given is searched first

10153182
setinterval	settimeout	required	placeholder
using settimeout or setinterval work on every 100 placeholder at a time required change in main scripts

10153234

what i m trying to achieve is a simple deployment so that when i push to the bare repository the dev repository pull the changes

10153481
pull	push
when i make changes to my local repository and push them to the bare when the dev trys to pull it gives me things like -

10153500
int	chars
the datatype of the fields is chars but you are using int in the query

10153508
width	height
before attempting to plot this signal to a picturebox we scale the signal to fit the width and height

10153533
google-chrome	firefox
also you could try to use firefox or google-chrome and copy the text from there to outlook

10153568
vsto	add-in
so in this sense the vsto add-in does not behave like the code in vba would at all

10153600
google-chrome	firefox
plain javascript works on firefox google-chrome greasemonkey and others

10153611

the problem is that the desired protocols post and get will be removed for the entire isapi folder and its subfolders

10153713
google-chrome	firefox
for the record these days both firefox and google-chrome have persist options in their inspectors conosole

10153756
width	height
for example if your view is in a linearlayout then you will only be able to adjust params that relate to a linearlayout gravity weight width height etc. so you would not be able to adjust the absolute x y coords

10153761
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
what i want to happen exactly the same but to be able to touch the uibutton easily like i can if i turn off the uitapgesturerecognizer on the view it s sitting on

10153800
nsurl	nsstring
my code which included tips from elsewhere on converting from a nsstring to nsurl follows

10153808
put	get
and if you need to get know what you new id was while insert -ing data use output clause of insert statement - so the copy of new rows is put to table-type param

master2 parent 2 children 2

10153831
children	parent
master1 parent 1 children 1

10153831
children	parent
master2 parent 2 children 2 -- difference

10153831
children	parent
it looks like the childs are referring to the same array also i did slice the initial children array which did work with the parent array as expected

10153839
nsurl	nsstring
both of which take the file location as an nsstring so there s not need to convert to an nsurl

10153859
hash	hmac
i don t see any mention of hmac in the documentation though so it is much more likely that the key is included as last part in the hash calculation but is not in the package of course

10153859
hash	md5
the plain md5 hash is then used as some poor man s authentication scheme

10153895
put	get
to get ipython to recognize site packages put something like this in a file named .ipython profile_default startup 00-virtualenv.py or something similar

10153923
flask	django	flask	web.py	django	web.py
something lightweight minimal like web.py or flask is imo a much better place to start than django if your focus is on learning and avoiding magic i have used all three

10153923
flask	web.py
if this is too difficult you might want to come back to it later after playing with a more automatic framework like web.py or flask

10153968
getter	setter
you just have to have appropriate getter and setter for the bean variable

10154021
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
please add uinavigationbar instead of uinavigationitem

10154088

each childview could then be me made up of a framelayout containing an imageview and a number of textview on top of the imageview

10154122
multiplying	subtraction
a descending sort is achieved by changing the order of subtraction or multiplying the result by -1

10154131
portrait	landscape
but the problem is that the very second screen rotates from portrait to landscape or from landscape to portrait the whole form resets and all the fields that were visible become invisible

10154144
istream	getline
then when reading the file you can use istream getline to extract text strings and to extract numbers

10154167
post	get
i ve heard that there might be a possibility to post get query and pass it some handler in a way that doesn t make you wait for the answer when answer comes it just calls the given handler that handles the result

10154187
google-chrome	firefox
i m using font awesome for my project and it works fine for google-chrome firefox and ie9 but it fails show icons for ie8

in the systemd log daemons devicemgr always repeated

10154365
for-loop	loops
i have my mako templates running through for loops to create some tables for me and i was wondering if i could update the data in the for-loop and have mako render that specific part of the html to easily update the webpage

10154381
nsexpression	nspredicate
it s simpler you don t need to create a nspredicate just the nsexpression

10154421
ppl	tbb
if possible the best thing is to use libraries which abstract threads away and instead focus on tasks like intel tbb microsoft ppl

10154421
ppl	tbb
instead one should try - tbb and ppl do it - to split work on the different threads by applying a task-stealing pattern see the tbb wiki page

10154495
sorting	filtering
you can use a javax.swing.table.tablerowsorter for sorting and filtering see tablerowsorter

10154507
hide	show
probably because you hide then toggle every time which results in a show

10154521
median	minimum
what determines the number of crossings is the order of arrangement of the edges in every layer.but again finding the minimum number of crossings or finding a maximum crossing-free set of edges is np-complete so again it is typical to resort to heuristics such as placing each vertex at a position determined by finding the average or median of the positions of its neighbors on the previous level and then swapping adjacent pairs as long as that improves the number of crossings.

10154537
xsl-fo	xslt
it takes xsl-fo compliant xslt code and xml and generates pdf files according to the xsl-fo spec

10154540
post	get
however with the get method the response comes in 13 ms but i need to use post

10154574
post	get
large latencies are one reason to use multiple threads in the first place - multiple lookups ad site get post can then happen in parallel

10154596
disk	ram
which buffers file data in ram delay-writing it to the disk

10154596
disk	ram
ram not disk

10154625
int	chars
i have an int n on firs line and then two n n matrixes of chars

10154640
disk	ram
i think the most reliable option for output would be to disk file or database instead or ram running python object then you read the info from file afterwards

10154642
children	parent
anyway the main point here is that a component should not concern itself with adding itself to its parent just with creating its own content children

10154709
memset	malloc	memset	calloc	calloc	malloc
i have no idea what getinitialaddress is supposing to return but if it is calling calloc or allocating some memory with malloc and then zeroing it with memset it is probable that the memory zone pointed by p starts with zero

10154789
width	height
file slides 1.jpg video false thumb thumbs 1.jpg caption some text thmcapt 1 link date mod 15395 size 42 kb width 264 height 520 rel 0

10154837
post	get
i have the the server set up but im not sure what methods i need to use to connect to the php server using post method and also how the iphone will get the response from the server

10154873
sorting	filtering
this may also feel more familiar to you coming from javascript as you can add new functionality to the class as well like custom sorting or maybe filtering

10154883
super	self
so combines call super s -init method assign the result to self and check if we got non-nil from super s -init that is that super didn t fail to initialize

10154905
implements	extends
when i implements my interceptor that extends emptyinterceptor i added the method onflushdirty and so on

10154921
client-side	server-side
i just started looking into tower.js the last couple of hours and it looks like that the framework provides a nice structure for placing both server-side and client-side code similar to the assets folder in rails

10154923
for-loop	loops
you are capturing your loops variable so when the for-loop is finished the variable c has the value 4 which is the value the function sees when it executes

10154947
post	get
this will work regardless you are using post or get method in your form

10154984
cos	sin
i m interested in information about the speed of sin and cos in open gl shader language

10154984
cos	sin
as has been pointed out counting clock cycles of individual operations like sin and cos doesn t really tell the whole performance story

10154984
cos	sin
so to clarify my question what i m really interested in is whether it s worthwhile to optimize away sin and cos calls for common cases

10155014
hash	md5
i m trying to find the md5 hash so i can start a google maps tutorial

10155017
put	get
in short i do the get request i put the result of the request in #mydiv i format it and i fadein the div

10155035
superclass	subclassing
in general instances of subclassing may be larger than those of their superclass so you should not expect the subclassing to fit into your vector s slot

10155060
put	get
the problem is that i don t know how to tell objectify that user parent is root and when i do multiple put user i get

10155091
s-function	simulink	matlab	s-function	matlab	simulink
note this is my first time using a matlab s-function and i ve only used simulink a handful of times

10155091

select src width height from photo_src where photo_id

10155127
put	get
i need to know how to get it in a form that i can put on a cd as a soft copy for a demonstration at school since this is a project

10155129
tinyint	boolean
if you have boolean tinyint fields in your acl table such as allowupdates andd allowdeletes then you should default these to false 0 so that when a new user is created they will get the least privileges until you specifically set them

10155231
xeround	cleardb
cleardb and xeround are a few

10155248
cos	sin
it s certainly slower to use texture lookups for sin cos as it is to execute the instructions

10155272
int	chars
either use the string itself as the queue id or if you need an int use string.hashcode hashcode returns the same value for the same chars

10155284
equals	gethashcode
however this also means that if gethashcode is not overridden so that it corresponds to the types equals method you will not be able to find such an object in one of the collections

10155284
equals	gethashcode
you should almost always implement both gethashcode and equals or none of them

10155285
equals	gethashcode
you have to override gethashcode as well - this goes hand in hand with overriding equals

10155293
equals	gethashcode
note that it s dangerous to use mutable fields for calculating equals or gethashcode

10155297
portrait	landscape
768 is for ipad-style tablets in landscape portrait mode

10155304
ubuntu	linux
i m using eclipse 3.7 latest stable scala ide 2.0.0 and scala 2.9 on ubuntu linux 11.10

dex2jar	proguard
but then i realized that there were tools like dex2jar that would reveal all my code even with some obfuscation from proguard in particular this hardcoded key

10155321
listadapter	listactivity
when my class extends activity rather than listactivity the application works but then i am unable to use a listadapter which i need

10155332
rss	feed
if you have access to those rss feed you can parse them using the documentbuilderfactory

10155335
client-side	server-side
the choice is about doing it client-side or server-side typically by using the sql replace see below

10155372
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
minimally you should free the retained subviews pre-arc in didreceivememorywarning and in dealloc

10155376
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the most common cases are the uinavigationcontroller and the uitabbarcontroller with the ipad you can see also uisplitviewcontroller and pageviewcontrollers

10155379
super	extends
super refers to the base class that the current class extends

10155379
super	extends
so if parent extends child and you create a new child super refers to the parent class and doing something like super in the constructor would call the parent s constructor and this refers to the actual child instance you created with new

10155380
super	extends
super refers to the superclass that a class extends

10155393
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you should use uinavigationcontroller for switching between uiviewcontroller

10155400
google-chrome	firefox
this happens only in firefox 11 google-chrome and ie8 work as expected

10155474
onchange	onkeyup
to be safe bind to onkeyup oninput and onchange

10155479
super	extends
super is the derived class parent when your class extends it through the extends keyword and you can invoke the overridden method through the use of the keyword super

10155727
rss	feed
i m making a small rss reader and i want it to parse a website and make a list of the feed

10155759
stdout	stderr
it means that the standard error descriptor stderr 2 is to be redirected to the standard output descriptor stdout 1

10155796
awt	swing
on the other hand the standard edition of java offers the swing widget set the awt widget set

10155807
super	extends
further ambiguity can arise when you extends classes inherit functionality for a parent or super class because the option of overriding the parent method arrises

10155821
xpages	lotus
xpinc ibm lotus notes xpages in the notes client

10155821
xpages	lotus
xpages is ibm s java server faces jsf implementation for lotus notes and domino

10155822
xpages	lotus
xpinc is ibm lotus notes xpages in the notes client

10155832
post	get
if you haven t been following along for the past couple years you might get some value out of reading one of glenn block s original post on the topic

10155898
stdout	stderr
you must redirect stdout and stderr

10155908
for-loop	loops
the downside is that this optimization adds code complexity the additional for-loop at the end to finish loops for the len 4 items left if the length is not evenly divisible by 4 and of course it s an architecture-dependent optimization whose magnitude of improvement will vary by hardware compiler etc.

10155947
getter	setter
you use setter and getter to isolate the class variables from the outside world so you don t need to allow other code to access them directly

10155949
getter	setter
a setter typically changes the state of an object in some way and a getter typically just returns some aspect of the state of an object

10156053
postgresql	mysql
works with mysql and postgresql and possibly others and will prevent any other connection to the database from reading the rows returned to you how granular that lock is depends on the engine used indexes etc - check your database s documentation

10156053
datamapper	activerecord
activerecord supports both so you can look there for inspiration if datamapper doesn t

10156073
int	double
it isn t that clear with variables of type float or double of course easier with int and strings and especially useful with pointers

10156093
ssl	https
what i now need to do is include this in my original ssl redirect logic to ensure that any change password requests are redirected to the same url but over https instead

this is occasionally useful for programs that want to take piped input but also read input from the user from stdout or more commonly stderr although using dev tty is more reliable in that case

10156171
sorting	filtering
see sorting and filtering for how to create a rowfilter instances of which can be added to a jcombobox and applied in the combo s action listener

10156199
getter	setter	accessor	properties
when you declare a properties in objective-c the properties are atomic by default so that synthesized accessor provide robust access to properties in a multithreaded environmentâ that is the value returned from the getter or set via the setter is always fully retrieved or set regardless of what other threads are executing concurrently

10156199
accessor	properties
then it means a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly

10156221
profiling	debugging
turn on template debugging and the output profiling in

10156223
inline	inlining
i m no c++ internals expert but i d assume that the inlining of function calls and instantiating templates is about manipulating the syntax tree before while and after it s been annotated with semantic information necessary to compile it properly as both of those seem to assume knowing a lot of stuff like type info and if something is good to be inline that is not yet known during scanning and parsing

10156244
stdout	stderr
and then invoke it with identifiable stdin stdout and stderr

10156244
stdout	stderr
there aren t any common uses of this but you might use it as a dirty hack to get a way to print to the terminal if whomever calls your script redirects stdout and stderr and for whatever reason you re not able to change that

avr	microcontroller
i am creating a hardware midi device based around an avr microcontroller

10156528
comparator	comparable
in the contract of treeset the requirement is laid out that all entries have to be comparable or you have to provide a comparator

10156528
comparator	comparable
this is also why you didn t see a compile-time error entries are only cast to comparable in the absence of an explicit comparator .

10156569
bluetooth	usb
you should be able to do with the usb for your device though you should focus on the usb anytime you want to transmit data from outside the phone into it though you could probably also do it with an ir broadcaster bluetooth broadcaster set up instead of a wired switch

10156604
put	get
you can find more information on the usage of the grid system over at the bootstrap scaffolding documentation they also have a stacked grid which you can view the source off to get an idea of how the rows are stacked up and how the content within are put together

10156605
stdout	stderr
only difference is that console executables automatically opens console window and c c++ crt runtime associates standart stdout stdin stderr handles to go to this window

10156608

10156801
post	get
based on that i m sure you ll be able to get to a working solution or post it here and we can help you out

10156817
cos	sin
you d have to test this out yourself but i m pretty sure that branching in a shader is far more expensive than a sin or cos calculation

10156822
layoutparams	viewgroup
your textview s are children of a tablerow so you should set an instance of tablerow.layoutparams for the layoutparams instead of the simple one probably from the viewgroup super class that you currently use

10156868
post	get
the pattern you ve heard about is this post redirect get

10156868

how to specify width and height of a drawable item

10156898
min	max
i played around with the min and max height properties to achieve this but it isn t an ideal solution and doesn t always work

10156898
min	max
edit min and max height seemed to be ignored almost

10156898
min	max
adding min and max height made no difference to this

10156908
equals	compareto
also right now your compareto function is non-functional it always returns 0 -- this is like saying that all items are equals

10156909

then how do i use this to get number of post for a particular day

10156949
button	checkbox
i would like to replace the checkbox with button

10156997
getter	setter
in objective-c we can add property and synthesize to create a property -- like an instance variable with getter and setter which are public to the users of this class

10156997
getter	setter
then there won t be the overhead of calling the getter and setter as methods

10157064
versioning	upgrade
it s really nice for versioning and upgrade support of plugins with mef having a v2 contract that can also load plugins that only implement v1 of the contract

10157072
onclick	onkeyup
in your validate statement include the validclass option as well as onkeyup and onclick if you want the messages to appear as changes are made to the form

10157100
getter	setter
synthesize creates a default getter setter and instance variable unless you ve defined any of those things yourself

10157119
ubuntu	linux
the server is a 16 core intel xeon 8 cores with hyperthreading i think and 12gb ram running ubuntu 10.04 linux 3.2.4-20120307 x86_64

10157124
width	height
then the layout manager gets and sets the height preferred for that width

reedcopsey recommendation of perfview or it s predecessor the clr profiler is a good one and will give you a better idea how your memory is being allocated

10157274
int	chars
it might help to imagine that void is the base class for everything and int and chars and whatnot are all subclasses of void.

10157295
uilabel	uibutton
i set this up and it works great to change the value of a uilabel by pushing a uibutton

10157299
for-loop	arrays
so if i were to retrieve the data from notifications arrays the one containing all individual notification arrays i would use a for-loop and echo the results after sorting the arrays based on time

10157350
children	parent
i have a parent object that contains a property that is a list of children objects

10157351
width	height
while the width can be determined by the element s content the height is always determined by the element s content

10157351
width	height
by its very nature it scales width-wise and the content flows to an appropriate height based on the available width

10157355
width	height
just bind to the window object on the resize and orientationchange events and use the jw player resize method after getting the new width and height

10157369
gridview	linqdatasource
and here is the linqdatasource that populates the gridview

10157373
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu which is based on linux uses forward slashes to delimit directory names and it doesn t have drive letters like e

10157382
getter	setter
property and synthesize is set are getting getter and setter methods

10157382
getter	setter
if you want to use the variable as instance variable and your custom getter and setter methods you can do but some times when you set the value for variable and while retrieving value of variable sometimes will become zombie which may cause crash of your app

10157432
post	put
i also want the viewers to be able to view other post of different weather stories so i know i need to put the information into and array

10157439
width	margin
defining the width and then setting the margin to be half the width is the key when using this technique

itâ s also convenient to delegate tls ssl https to nginx

10157455
int	chars
i need to provide flexibility as for the data type in the list nodes int chars

10157467
spaces	delimiter
assuming that the country name is always the last component of country where components are delimiter by spaces then you could do this

10157495
firefox	safari
this is different in safari and firefox

10157495
firefox	safari
safari firefox do it very smoothly and well

10157495
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox is just as good as safari its just google-chrome is doing it badly

10157517
unsigned	short
byte and short as well as all unsigned types are missing

10157685
rss	feed
this is a snippet of the xml file from an rss feed

10157745
for-loop	arrays
if you are caching the arrays s count before entering the for-loop then make sure you decrement that too when removing an object

10157751
folder	directory
make sure you have your external jars in a libs folder in the project s base directory note the s here--not lib

10157756
google-chrome	safari
as to seeing what the actual server header response is this would be listed in the network tab in google-chrome inspector net tab in firebug or safari s development tool section i forget the name offhand

10157816
post	get
earlier i was using it on the protocol level so was sending get post requests and receiving web responses

10157823
accessor	properties
threadsafe access generated accessor are atomic by default so you don t have to worry about race conditions accessing the properties from multiple threads

10157828
google-chrome	firefox
my local dev environment consists of mamp google-chrome and firefox

10157833
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and it looks good in firefox and ie 7 8 9 but not in safari and google-chrome

10157833
google-chrome	safari
i have no idea why its doing this in google-chrome and safari any help would be appreciated

10157837
portrait	landscape
you could likely adapt it to modify the meta tag when the device changes between portrait and landscape

10157863
short	base
long story short you should write a base template and then extend this template

10157873
width	height
i would use auto for both width and height

10157897
disk	ram
while we were trending towards systems with huge disk and always-on paged memory the industry has flipped and now we have smartphones and tablets with limited ram and no on-demand paging

10157902
pull	push
try doing a git pull to sync up with the remote repository then you should be able to push to it

10157970
min	max
the best solution is to use a componentlistener implement componentresized and enforce the min max size that way

10157997
min	max
i have controller say home_controller providing max 10 min 4

10157997
min	max
but it doesn t seem to be working because when i look at the resultant javascript file from firebug wherever i have max or min they just show up as blank

10157999
int	double
when the type of a numeric expression is ambiguous haskell tries to resolve it first to int and then to double a floating-point number if that doesn t work

10157999
int	double
this specific example happened because 5.3 can t be an int since int is not fractions so it resolved to double in that case

10158066
width	height
you can edit the image element s width and height attributes.

10158066
width	height
you can set the width and height to either pixels or percent

10158066
width	height
but that will take 100 of the width and height of the parent element

10158099
width	height
you can set only width or only height to 100

10158099
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this might not work in all browsers but it does in the latest versions of firefox google-chrome and opera

10158124
put	get
if the 32byte index matches the thread index in the warp then all 32 accesses get put into one 128 transaction

10158135
post	get
they only communicate via get and post commands

10158156
udp	tcp
i am a novice in packet processing.and once i have idendified a flow tcp and udp how do i work out the direction of the flow.

10158166
udp	tcp
netflow applies to any protocol including tcp and udp

10158166
udp	tcp
so to answer your question yes udp packets should be treated the same as tcp

10158190
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox 3.6 and i don t need it to work in ie or google-chrome

10158238
for-loop	arrays
i fill an arrays in for-loop and when i try to get an item from it i always get the first element

10158303
getter	setter
now obviously this is still a problem with setter and getter however you are less likely to forget to use weakself since you have to explicity call self.property whereas ivars are referenced by self implicitly

10158312
16-bit	64bit
i think the size of the struct is correct short should provide 16-bit for the segment address and long long 64bit for the offset

10158344
cout	cin	ubuntu	linux
when i tell something to cin cout cerr or printf scanf or take arguments from the command line this all happens from the linux terminal in ubuntu

10158351
int	chars
here is an implementation of a symbol table where the symbols are single chars and the values are just int as with your code

10158354
stdout	stderr	cout	cin
cin cout cerr and printf scanf fprintf stderr ... use the standard c preopened files stdin stdout and stderr which are defined both in linux and windows

10158371
cout	cin
cin and cout and printf and scanf work much the same in windows as they do in linux

10158401
bash	zsh
i can reproduce this behaviour in bash and zsh

10158418
children	parent
in other words as i populate the widget with children the children shrink as necessary to maintain the parent geometry

10158418
children	parent
however if the parent is expanded the children expand to fill the new space

10158420
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout rather than setinterval interval is for repeating a timer task timeout is a single timer task

10158479
post	get
i am thinking that the client should either get or post their request to gettag in order to get a response back

10158516
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome firefox safari

10158517
onfocus	onblur
i am creating a input form and i know how to do onfocus onblur placeholder stuff etc etc

10158520
spaces	delimiter
note that both these solutions assume that words are always delimiter by spaces which isn t true in general

10158557
onfocus	onblur
edit 2 part of the problem you might be seeing is the fact that you have onfocus and onblur on your input and the onfocus is clearing out the existing value

10158605
post	get
turns out i needed to loop through the post and call the tumblr api to get the embed code for the audio post

10158650
onfocus	onblur
if i understand you correctly all you need to do is remove the onfocus and onblur event handlers

10158653
put	get
don t put the word get in the uri as you ve suggested

10158700
int	chars
if you have a primitive type the first chars will be all you get for int it will be i for chars c for unsigned long long q etc.

10158726
stdout	stderr
however both running processes has the default streams like stderr stdout and stdin

10158740
width	height
i know the width and height of the image and i know that pixels are 3-byte rgb values

10158756
min	max
i m trying to use std min_element and std max_element to return the min and max elements in a vector of doubles

10158756
min	max
i could of course write my own procedure to find the min max but i d like to understand how to use the functions

10158763
min	max
min max_element return the iterator to the min max element not the value of the min max element

10158764
put	get
if you update in the wrong order it will put lats first and then you get the error

10158769
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work fine in ie google-chrome and safari crashes if you rapidly click the black square however it s giving me problems in firefox

10158796
margin	height
to reposition any one of these all that is needed is to adjust the element in the appropriate direction top bottom margin padding height

10158855
int	chars
i don t think it is casting a chars or any other int type to a or other pointer type is well-defined if ill-advised

10158870
opera	google-chrome
i tried pixastic but it s broken in my browsers google-chrome opera and ie7

10158893
google-chrome	firefox
as can be seen ie and firefox works properly but not with google-chrome

10158916
uiview	subviews
also consider tagging the views with the uiview tag property so you can add the subviews once and then won t have to recreate them with reuse

10158933
put	get
you can then put in pointers to the subclasses and use dynamic_cast to get pointers back to the subclasses when you need them

10158951
for-loop	loops
but my while loops when doing the for-loop isn t pulling in the data from the infile as i am debugging it after the for-loop doing a system.out.print

10158960
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller that hosts 5 uinavigationcontroller let s call them n1 - n5

10158975
centos	linux
i have to design a usb monitoring program that ll keep checking usb ports of a linux centos

10159021
accessor	properties
instead of leveraging synthesize for properties nsmanagedobject sublcasses leverage the dynamic keyword which indicates the accessor will be created at runtime - in this case by the nsmanagedobjectcontext

10159029
tapply	read.table
but the error message says the problem is caused by the call to tapply rather than anything about incorrect file names and i have literally no idea how that could happen since i thought a data frame which read.table creates always has the same number of rows for each column

10159044
translation	localization
take for example the case of localization of a web application - changes in translation and views and so on

10159049
comparator	comparable
but the way it is designed right now allows you to create a treeset with no comparator thus use the natural ordering with an element type that is not comparable to itself

10159067
width	height
right now it s an anchor tag with a set width height and a background placement

10159069
groupbox	panel
the model consist of a groupbox that contains a panel

10159070
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
the use case you re after isn t totally clear - but i m going to assume you are acting as an identity provider idp with pingfederate and you have accounts stored in some system database that have their passwords md5 hash with a salt

10159092
button	checkbox
i deselected the checkbox where the value is 3 which is on the related_products_ids and after hitting the save button the value 3 on the related_products_ids will be deleted so that current rows now is 2 and 4

10159107
bionic	libc
to be more specific that device is an android google tv box logitech revue and it seems that it s a bit different from regular android my guess it doesn t use retarded bionic and uses normal libc regular pthread and it s seems to be closer to regular linux

10159122
post	get
the load method does a get and not a post

10159130
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox

unix	sunos	ubuntu	linux
it compiles up and runs on my linux box ubuntu as well as other linux boxes both x86 and x64 but on a sunos generic_142900-02 sun4u sparc unix box it crashes on the line

10159238
button	checkbox
for select boxes checkbox and radio button the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus

10159305
int	double
an int a double and a int list

10159349
hide	show
nowadays the standard method for changing a page based on a drop down box or some other element is to get javascript to hide show parts of the page or otherwise modify the page to suit using dom methods

10159352
punctuation	words
cts tokenize for breaking up a given string into words space and punctuation parts

10159376
int	chars
this maybe a unique solution i don t have enough info on your application so i will post it anyway but if you only want alphanumeric names you can compare the int value of a range of chars which would be a simple r if statement

10159389
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase and couchdb share a lot in common but they are not fully compatible with one another

10159440
width	height
use layoutparams to do so where you can set width and height like below

10159457
int	chars
i m trying to figure out how have something like enter an expression take in 3 variables the first int the chars of the operation and the second int

10159492
width	height
you can set height and width like this also

10159500
portrait	landscape
when i tried it in internet explorer 8.0 with 3 different images 1 portrait and 2 landscapes i realized that only the portrait image was displayed entirely meanwhile both landscape images were truncated i can see just the upper part of the image

10159508
pull	push
the solution for me was to do a pull instead of a push as charlesbailey suggested

10159540
post	get
now to get a list of words in descending order of frequencies you can convert your map to a list first then apply collections.sort as was suggested in this post

10159559
width	height
answer 1 try defining the modal css class and set the width and height

10159617
x86	64bit
if you re compiling for anything but 32-bit x86 integers and pointers will not be 4 bytes but 8 for 64bit which would cause problems

10159633
int	double
i m using a queue service that seems to only allow me to send a string as the message sort of don t think thats right but haven t been able to prove otherwise but i need 3 different data items to process my work an int double and int

10159634

you could use maxima from within the sage notebook and resort to the interact command

10163596
sage	maxima
see also sage s interface to maxima

10163615
apache	nginx
i ve recently setup an nginx reverse proxy to my apache server due to high loads on mysql and http

10163617
hide	show
i am making use of contextmenustrip in my program and apparently it wont show its shortcut keys mnemonics those that should be show as underlines under letters preceded by unless i press alt but when i press alt the show contextmenustrip will hide because the main menu of the form will receive focus

10163665
decltype	auto
this makes use of auto and a simple decltype both c++11 features that the intel c++ compiler supports as of v12 though i haven t tested this code with anything except gcc

10163679
accessor	properties
if you need read-only access to monitors but don t want to implement a full-blown collection then a simple accessor properties and count properties would be enough

10163684
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
what you could do is create your own navigationbar don t use the uinavigationcontroller s uinavigationbar - you can then customize it and assign it easily animatable properties such as alpha

10163699
isotope	masonry
so i m using the isotope masonry layout

10163722
getter	setter
if globalapp is a class then create a object for it and then use getter and setter methods

10163730
put	get
this works fine for a load test of a burst of 10 000 requests but when i put a few thousand more i suddenly get this error so i am wondering whether its coming from some os limit

10163825
express	node.js
i am writing an application using mongo using mongo native driver node.js and express

10163867
spaces	delimiter
setting 0 as delimiter in ifs find by -print0 and read by -d can handle filenames containing special characters like single quotes double quotes spaces etc

10163867
subshell	ifs
the outmost parenthese puts the entire command execute in subshell hence keeps the current shell s ifs intact

10163884
put	get
this means that when you call .avg you will get back the same type you put in instead of always getting double

10163884
int	double
however int is not a kind of fractional meaning that it doesn t make sense to get an int and the result of averaging int s so we have to have a special case for int that converts to a double

10163884
int	double
so averaging int s gives us a double

10163913
mongodb	bson
if you wanted objects instead of hashes then you d have to wrap the mongodb cursor and bson orderedhash instances with object yourself possibly via struct

10163960
namenode	hdfs
note you dont need to format the hdfs as you can just stop all namenode and the data node and again start the hadoop processes as it does not get currupted frequently after stopping and starting hadoop if it gives any error then you format the file system

10163979
postgresql	mysql
mysql or postgresql

10164106
hash	salt
i thought of making a hash of the id and a field in the object title for example or a salt but i m worried that this might have a serious effect on processing overhead

10164121
mediarecorder	audiorecord
with mediarecorder i use setmaxduration and this work well but i need a good approach with audiorecord too

10164150

salt	md5
you can create a new column with the values of md5 concat id some salt and calculate it before making the select statement to save calulation overhead

10164245
multiplying	add
you already mentioned you know how to do operations on 128 bit numbers so...just do the operations multiplying and add

10164245
multiplying	add
if you dont have a way to multiplying and add 128 bits you wont get very far with a 128 bit calculator so perhaps the above was un necessary

10164253
post	get
if you come up with a solution and you get stuck post that and you ll likely receive help fixing the problem areas

10164259
put	get
but i do not see anything i get response with no error just saying moved permenently and when i put the same link in browser it works

10164308
submit	submission
at this point you can probably remove joe so the user knows the submission was successful and does not submit for joe again

10164335
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
the hash ids can be setup however you think md5 with salt will work in this case but anything simple will do and store them in an array in the session

10164337
children	parent	post	get
i d like to automate the creation of anchor links for a series of blog post - i ve been trying to use the each command to loop through children in the parent div but i just can t get it working properly and am now so confused i don t know what i m doing

i want to get all tags of post

10164438
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
first we use ant maven 2 and jdk jdk1.6.0_25.then we found wso2is-3.2.0-src products pom.xml missed one end tag and we corrected it

10164445
implements	modifiers
this is by design just imagine one of the most popular reasons which forces a developer to implements an interface explicitly memeber name ambiguity so you have an existing class which already exposes public member with some name and you can t change an existing class api since it is used by other systems also you cannot change interface api member names signatures and both class and interface defines a member with the same name so providing public acces modifiers for an interface member does not make sense since member with the same name already declared in a class

10164462
getter	setter	accessor	properties
the properties are essentially just shortcuts for creating accessor setter getter

10164463
min	max
the min and max are then used to calculate the intensity of a lazer for reading binary data

10164559
post	get
data from serialize can be used in either an ajax post or get so there is no issue there

10164604

this all works fine when i test it in firefox but when i test it in other browsers google-chrome safari mobile safari the script infinite loops

10164633
pubnub	pusher
the simplest way would be to use pusher or pubnub or similar so you can push code to a channel containing the pid and the client can subscribe to the same channel

10164635
int	boolean
i am running into a problem with a nsmanagedobject subclass where the value is set to boolean value but the primitive type always seems to be an int

10164635
int	boolean
when the property is an nsnumber and it s value is 1 or 0 i need to take a different code path if it was intended to be a boolean than if it was intended to be an int

10164777
mouseover	mouseout
what happens when you move the mouse really fast over it is that your menu item get the mouseover event it expands the menu but before the menu is expanded it will receive the mouseout event a little bit later and collapses it but because the mouse is now over the expanded menu it receives a mouseover again i m not really shure on this one because it seems strange that mouseover out events are dispatched even if the mouse is not moved

10164782
min	max
so that the lookup for the min max will be o 1 and the load would go on the insertion o nlogn

10164793

compile ffserver and use it s int main int argc chars argv function

10164935
free	malloc
other advice don t use malloc free in c++ use new delete

10164956
stdout	fflush
edit however fflush stdout is not guaranteed to work because implementations are permitted to drop partial lines to stdout partial means not terminated by n

10164963
packets	pcap
on a linux router i wrote a c-program which uses pcap to get the ip header and length of the packets

10164971
width	height
the width and height values are correct and always the n 4 if is called the image has an alpha channel so this is correct

10165001
rtl	vhdl	rtl	verilog	verilog	vhdl
for this reason rtl coding guidelines that want to be consistent for both verilog and vhdl will insist that all outputs are assigned in a separate output logic section

10165040
int	boolean	tinyint	boolean
i m not familiar with drapper but since mysql will return any boolean as an int normally tinyint one option could be to change your class to the following

10165158
french	polish
french polish spanish german etc

10165228
int	chars
you cannot replace an operator or function name with a symbol which is given by user because compiler has to know which function should be called and there is no mechanism to convert a + chars to operator+ int int call embedded in a language

10165281
hide	show
the idea is you want to use javascript to show hide questions depending on the answer of the previous question

10165282
ubuntu	linux

10165285
getter	setter
i tried in java the same thing with and without getter and setter

10165308
multiplying	multiplication
even if you multiplying all prices by 10000 there is still plenty of headroom to hold large values even across multiplication

10165308
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
before you add or subtract you need to multiplying values with a smaller constant to match those with a bigger constant

10165330
profiler	yourkit
if you need to look deeper look at yourkit java profiler which will give you a plethora of information to help identify the source

10165346

the actual rules are a bit complex but simplified all scalar types are automatically converted when an operator has operands of different types

10165385
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome firefox it works fine i m on a mac

10165434
google-chrome	safari

i can upload original bmp file but even with this png result is the same - see below

10165543
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit the 3 000 limit is a google-chrome limit firefox has a 10 000 character limit and safari has no limit

10165544
oncreate	onstart
when i tried to display the dialog in the oncreate onstart methods the dialog just showed up at the end with 100 complete i now realise this is because nothing is drawn to the screen until after the oncreate onstart methods

10165725
ibatis	mybatis
mybatis the world s most popular sql mapping framework. sic formerly ibatis

10165735
perl	tcl
tcl arrays are closer to what python calls a dict and a hash in perl

10165953
int	chars
the chars read as an int in the range 0 to 65535

10165959
tablet	mdpi
mdpi is the default so drawable and drawable-mdpi are the same thing and i don t know which android chooses in this case - but you re designing for a tablet and tablet are generally mdpi devices so it correctly gets it from drawable-mdpi

10165959
screens	mdpi
you could use drawable-xlarge-mdpi if you want separate mdpi resources to be used for extra-large screens

textview	imageview
i am trying to make a gallery that uses textview instead of imageview but i cannot seem to make a working adapter

10166047

seems like a job for isnull or coalesce

10166073
portrait	landscape
and then in landscape its portrait video but the image is right side up

i don want to use tcp as i ve already got one going but i m kinda lost on how to do the same with udp

10166117
for-loop	loops
assuming two people are on data packet comes in check list use for-loop to loops throughout list and send the message to everyone on the list except the person who sent the message

10166213
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop in myfnatoi should be based on the length of numarray rather than the size of the arrays use strlen numarray and not 10

10166230
rar	zip
file-based compression systems such as rar and zip may be able to recover those files whose compressed data has not been damaged regardless of damage to the rest of the archive

10166504
width	height
ok the first bounding box is 1261x512 making width height 2.462890

10166504
width	height
i m calling the different number range a box with width w2 and height h1

10166504
width	height
if w2 h2 is not equal to 2.462890 this whole exercise is pointless because you need to rescale the width or height

10166504
multiplying	add
with the ratio measured for y we just multiplying 512 423 w2 then add to 25240264

10166594

10166712
for-loop	loops
the program will generate three identical tables starting from 1 kilometer through the input value for one number input using the while loops for the first set of calculations the for-loop for the second and the do loops for the third

after all multiplication can be performed by hand by repeatedly multiplying the first number by one of the digits from the second number and then adding all of the results

10166862
haskell	scheme
i don t know the scheme syntax but in haskell syntax if you wanted x to be a lazy parameter to a strict function f you might write something like and modify f appropriately to expect such lambdas and call them at the moment you want to un-lazy them

10166913
super	extends
here this refers to the current object - so this.x refers to a field in the current object and super refers to the object this object extends so you can get to a field up higher

10166929
move	drag
because you re using such approach i would recommend that you move the yourmodel.tt file into the separate class library project hold the shift key and drag and move it

10167087
min	max
i dont mind using std less std more std max std min or any of the inbuilt functor objects

10167087
min	max
however i would prefer not to use enums in the constructor and then depending on the enum value call min or max routines

10167097
width	height
maybe you can just wrap page content in a element which will have full width and full height and then you set rounded corners on it instead of body

10167118
iboutlet	ibaction
you can t specify any random methods nor should youâ the whole point of the iboutlet iboutletcollection and ibaction keywords is to declare in code that these properties methods are used by a nib

10167370
rss	feed
i have an rss feed with items that feature title s and descriptions

10167378

google-chrome	firefox
but although it works on google-chrome it is not working on firefox and cause i am javascript newbiew i cant figure out why

10167539
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
you also could handle the clicks in the items themselves by redefining their qgraphicsitem mousereleaseevent method it would remove the need for the evil cast but you have to remove the function layerview mousereleaseevent or at least recall the base class implementation qgraphicsview mousereleaseevent to allow the item s to receive the event

10167547
fflush	gets
when the buffer fills up it gets fflush to the disk

note - the below code works however this is a udp traceroute sends a udp packets and receives an icmp one and i need my program to send an icmp packets and receive an icmp packets

10171289

essentially the udp socket needs to be changed for an icmp one

10171302
post	get
you can use processor pages in web pages in the same way as you have in php but my preference would be house the processing logic in the same page as the form and then redirect on success using the post - redirect - get pattern prg regardless of whether i was using php or asp.net

10171310

in the newly opened directory dialog enter the path to your quickrep505 directory into the edit box or browse for it using the button with the opened folder icon and after you set it

10171674
free	malloc
it s also worth pointing out that on many operating systems heap memory may not be returned to the operating system until the process terminates instead the malloc free library notifies the os when it needs to grow the heap using sbrk on unix or virtualalloc on windows

10171674
free	malloc	free	strdup	free	realloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	strdup	strdup	malloc
if there are a great many relative to your virtual address space ram - you want to explicitly let the memory library know not all the originally requested memory is actually needed using realloc or you could even use strdup to allocate a new block more tightly based on actual needs then free the original - depending on your malloc free library implementation that might work out better or worse but very few applications would be significantly affected by any difference

also to execute a query which is stored in a string you have to use prepare and execute

10176594
post	put
then as code for your php this works well it receives two vars from post and if the contender which is the select contains a value different from 0 it will put it inside the variable

10176594
post	get
what it does is getting the current values of the select and of the input this is rather for thoroughness you could remove it and passing them to the loadxmldoc function which will transfer them directly to the php using get method there s no reason to use post

10176779
folder	dir
starting from current folder till my home dir

10176786
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox don t differ very much between the two tests but the slight difference is in opposite directions between the two

10176786
google-chrome	firefox
without a significant and consistent performance difference in google-chrome and firefox and ie9 showing the this test case to be substantially faster i think you can conclude that the design pattern you asked about is not delivering a consistent performance boost across browsers

10176830
width	height
it looks like document.body.offsetwidth and offsetheight will give you width and height of the current window

10176830

by putting the close in a finally you are sure that the connection is closed either in correct flow or in exception-handling i have omitted try-catch for clarity

10177090
mongodb	bson
jsoncpp is an independently developed library and so there are many differences between how it works and how mongodb s bson implementation work -- for better or for worse

10177090
mongodb	bson
the bson library is used extensively all throughout mongodb and so its requirements are quite different from the jsoncpp requirements

10177100
maven	pom.xml
it uses a parent pom.xml together with another maven project in which i think the jena version was changed and it also uses an external library that uses jena

browsers that don t support this fill keyword i know at least opera and firefox don t though firefox will support it as of version 12 do not discard the middle of the border-image but draw it on top of the background

10177452
rss	feed
in example it needs to pull an rss feed every 1 hour and call an certain rest api every 30 min

10177476

femi is correct you need to call joingroup to inform your network that you re interested in receiving packets for that multicast group

10177496
pop-up	dialog
see this question for how to do all that android image dialog pop-up

10177509

since subclassing is a superclass you can use an instance of subclassing and treat it as superclass

10177565
google-chrome	safari
then i noticed that both google-chrome and safari have this behavior

10177569
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
when i use pushviewcontroller the new viewcontroller appears with the navigationcontroller and the back button but the uitabbarcontroller disappears

10177570
superclass	subclassing
when you create a new subclassing object you can have that reference point to it because a subclassing is-a superclass instance

10177571
post	get
when we read sam ng s follow-up post we get the expression that that bug was not fixed because they believed a type-load exception would always be thrown

10177581
hide	show
you may need to wrap a div around the to do the show hide correctly

10177603
children	parent
that would stop the elements from being generated in children from parent

10177705
jboss	glassfish
obviously there are benefits to deploying to an application server like jboss or glassfish otherwise ears and app servers wouldn t exist

10177706
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you still need the navigation functionality just wrap your viewcontrollers inside a uinavigationcontroller and add the serounding navigationcontroller to the tabbar instead of the uiviewcontroller

10177716
sudo	passwd
i have ssh-key based authentication but a different sudo passwd on each machine

10177738

a 2048 bit binary data block would be 512 hex digits long

10177742

after extensive testing in firefox and safari while being perfectly aware that i won t ever get both browsers to view it all perfectly pixel-precisely fine as the original design views in my photoshop i stumbled over the most disturbing of issues

10177774
hide	show
you will have to manually show hide them based on the information you loaded in the controller

10177803
width	height
you are setting the width and height of the canvas using css width and height and not the html attributes

10177803
width	height
you need to define the width height either in the canvas tag

10177854
maven	m2e
m2e maven integration for eclipse to at least 1.0.2

10177858
qfiledialog	qdir
my understanding of the documentation for qdir and qfiledialog is that the following should show a file dialog with only executable files

10177864
portrait	landscape
special layouts for tablets portrait landscape different dpi etc reading the docs should save you much hassle later -

10177883
sorting	filtering
when i call radgrid.rebind in its sorting filtering event handlers the data updates

10177942
alloca	longjmp
so what is going on here is that there s a bunch of stack space allocated for stuff that might be needed unwind handlers calls to setjmp longjmp alloca or other compiler builtin functions but which isn t needed in your case as you never call the functions or use the features that might require them

10177964
explode	substr
using a combination of php s explode function and substr you could use to build an array of the names like this

10177965
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
i would also want to find the uiviewcontroller that displayed the uipopovercontroller in the first place

10177969
ubuntu	linux
if you re using ubuntu linux

10177971
google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome 18 and firefox 11

10177976

10177987
post	get
i don t think it should considering the link would pull the get and when i submit the form it should be a post

10178005
children	parent
essentially if i have 1 entity called i.e parent and the other entity which it has a relationship with is children and it is inverse

10178005
children	parent
i ve set the parentchildrenrelationship to optional but it looks like every time i create the parent entity it creates the children entity

10178079
for-loop	loops
i tried editing the for-loop to be a while loops instead

10178162
stdout	stderr
sometimes when the external process crashes due to a jvm crash see these hs_err_pid.log files those threads which read the stdout stderr of that external process begin consuming 100 cpu and never exit

10178192
children	parent
the value of children should either be nil for a one-to-one relationship or an empty nsset or nsarray for a one-to-many relationship depending on ordering for a newly created parent entity

10178193
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
this way the original target and action of each uibutton remains the same and the supplementary code to handle my popup is the action of the uigesturerecognizer

10178204
setinterval	settimeout
as a side note never pass strings to setinterval settimeout

10178245
width	height
i m trying to set the size of the children views of the gridlayout in such a way that with n rows and m columns the size of cells is directly related to the n m values and the width and height of the linearlayout

10178245
width	height
so for example i m trying to get the cell width and height as follows

10178245
width	height
i need to query for their correct or actual measured width height

10178330
hash	md5
also both the hash you cited have issues md5 more so and should not be used if there is any risk that someone could have any incentive to create documents having the same hash yet being different this is readily doable with md5 which is completely broken from a cryptographic point of view and possibly not far away with sha1

10178356
sysv	systemd
or use a platform specific ipc systemd shared memory via mmap sysv sockets etc

10178437
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox safari the event handler fires immediately after the click but i am observing weird behaviour in google-chrome

10178437
firefox	safari
notice that the event handler has not fired whereas it does in firefox safari

10178439
google-chrome	firefox
i m using the lastest stable version of firefox google-chrome on windows to test my application use socket.io

10178439
google-chrome	firefox
i try to uninstall firefox and google-chrome it still doesn t work

10178463

10178517
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

10178517
instances	transient
but that transient instances was never fetched and so cannot even be transient

10178521
listview	gridview
since my itemtemplate consists of a border it doesn t have native support for drag drop like the gridview or the listview

10178521
listview	gridview
i tried using both gridview and listview for my squares before but the gui became too sluggish so i switched to a simple border which made it alot faster

10178532
shadowing	named
even in functional languages there is named shadowing

10178586
m2e	pom.xml
if you have an approximate idea of the dependency needed or can figure out the one you need given a list then m2e s dependency search can be the quickest way of adding a dependency to your pom.xml

10178638
packets	multicast
to implement the approach above i thought to write a multicast client in android that receives the rtp packets and stitches together the stream

10178638

10178723
post	get
get the post from the view and check if it already excists in my database

10178726
spaces	linefeed
so long as you use the xml api instead of trying to write the xml out directly yourself you should be fine with any valid text broken surrogate pairs would probably cause an issue but what won t be valid is unicode code points less than spaces u+0020 aside from tab carriage return and linefeed

10178733
maven	pom.xml
we merge maven pom.xml files from one repository to another

10178747
subtract	add
then add it to the first and subtract it from the second

10178756
paas	jelastic
at these days this became common and using paas services like jelastic you can even get it pre-configured out of the box

10178793
pop-up	dialog
if you bring up the dropdown pop-up menu for a pressing escape should close that not the dialog

10178827
free	malloc
to resolve this you need to dynamically allocate space for each new element you add with malloc and release them with free when you remove them

10178876
sctp	tcp
any way i would do this only if tcp or sctp netty 4.x supports sctp can not be used for the purpose

10179035
public	protected
protected or public variables can be accessed on the page

10179057
mergesort	timsort
timsort is used by python and java for their sort methods and is rather supernaturally fast but it s a more complex algorithm than mergesort which matters if you re working in something like c - so if you just need something that works pretty well and is simple go with mergesort

10179065
integer	unsigned
the unsigned integer into the correspondingly sized signed type will

10179065
integer	unsigned
for mainframes then you can read an unsigned 4 or 8 byte integer

the network wave this bottleneck with localhost tests or a 40 gbe lan

10179081
bash	zsh
note i get the same results with bash as with zsh

superclass	subclassing
the assignment was to make a vehicle superclass and than three subclassing something like truck or jeep that would each have a couple traits of their own

10179178
comparator	comparable
the vehicle class must implement the comparable interface which i think i have figured out i have the comparator method written comparing the number of doors on vehicles and one other class must also implement the hybrid class i have no idea what this means

10179178
tostring	compareto	equals	tostring	equals	compareto
we then have to implement the tostring equals object o and compareto object o methods

10179178

i think i have the compareto down but with the equals i have no idea

10179219
min	max
#1140 - mixing of group columns min max count ... with no

webkit	gecko
in gecko and webkit the xmlhttprequest.onreadystatechange event fires every time new data is received making it possible to stream data slowly into the javascript runtime

this exception can also be thrown in petapoco if your poco doesn t have a parameterless constructor of either public or protected visibility

10179339
try-catch	exception-handling
if you want to write specific code for specific exception-handling you should use try-catch blocks to write appropriate code for each handler

10179393
nunit	mstest
nunit xunit or even mstest which comes with many editions of visual studio

10179395
int	chars
the thing is that when parsing and ruby sees that a number with more than two digits starts with the chars 0 it parses it as an octal int number

10179395
octal	decimal
thus when it parses 00 it is 0 in octal which is the same as 0 in decimal

10179402
ubuntu	linux
i am using gcc-4.5.2 on ubuntu linux

10179414
comparator	comparable
when a class implements an interface it s claiming to behave in a certain way for example when your class implements comparable it s claiming to be comparable to other objects and it satisfies this contract by implementing the comparator method.

10179464
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest

width	height
simple just take the height and width and divide it by 2

10179858
facade	mediator
facade 185 differs from mediator in that it abstracts a subsystem of objects to provide a more convenient interface

10180378
width	height
i was thinking that perhaps this could be done by customizing uitableviewcell and setting the frame s width and height so i could re-use the various benefits uitableviewcontroller delegate and datasource offer

10180386
union	distinct
the list to return contain dupes of the same proposal even after union and distinct

selecteditem	selectedindex
i believe you want selectedindex instead of selecteditem i m assuming here

your question might have been aswered before at lxml elementtree xmlparser namespace problem

i have used and setup teamcity and jenkins aka the new hudson before and while i would agree that teamcity is a lot slicker to set up it is only free for teams of 10 users or less

10182091
teamcity	jenkins
the killer feature in teamcity is the pre-checkin workflow where you can test code before checking it into source control and the nicety of jenkins is that it is completely free even if you grow beyond the 10 users and build agents

10182131
submit	submission	put	get
i heard that i can request to put my app in a holding area when i submit the app - meaning that the app will get reviewed but not made publicly available until a later day and that date is undetermined at the time of the submission for example we probably would like to have some major marketing event planned for the app etc

10182472
for-loop	loops
even if the while is not wrong i d prefer a for-loop in this case the number of iterations is fixed - the number of lines â i sometimes think of while loops as the gateway to the halting problem .

10182482
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i noticed this problem on firefox google-chrome and safari latest versions

10182569
ilist	icollection
i also have similar situations with icollection and ilist return types in other places

10182569
ienumerable	icollection
the reason i want to return either ienumerable or icollection is so that i m not returning more than needed

10182569
ienumerable	icollection
just to clarify what i m curious about is if it is okay that my return statement in the body is returning a but the method header has a return-type of ienumerable or possibly icollection collection etc.

10182639
for-loop	loops
instead of a for in loops you could as easily use a for-loop like so

10182665
rss	feed
this means the bbc news rss feed doesnt provide well-formatted xml

10182665
rss	feed
the best thing would be to issue a bug report to the bbc news rss feed provider so that they fix it

10182672

especially when the life of this project involves versioning upgrade because then you can seek a pre-packaged solution from the provider

10183249
versioning	upgrade
caveats i wouldn t do this without using versioning control and it will absolutely break if any core code changes happen between versioning upgrade

10183258
google-chrome	firefox
edit tested in firefox and google-chrome

10183259

it s not really running in java itself and it s limited in its logging to stdout and stderr

10184080
uiviewcontroller	uistoryboardsegue
as i am using storyboards i feel that the most versatile implementation would be subclassing uistoryboardsegue and on the perform method check if the user is attempting to access an restricted uiviewcontroller perhaps restricted controllers have a protocol property that specifies the required status logged in out

10184113
nsview	nstablecellview
inside my nstablecellview subclass i have an nsview which is selectable but not editable

10201518
try-catch	exception-handling
if you want your code to throw the appropriate exception-handling i d suggest not using try-catch blocks at all

10201518
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch is used to handle exception-handling as they arise and then keep running the program but it sounds like you don t want to handle them at all

10201580

when navigating a file hierarchy under cygwin pressing tab after cd + a few characters will replace those few characters by the name of a directory whose name starts by the same characters if such a directory is present in the current folder

10201906
strlen	substr
otherwise you re still going to need strlen to make sure it is at least 6 chars but then you can use substr to cut it to 10

10201906
strlen	substr
if whitespace does not count use ltrim rtrim before strlen and substr

10201909
for-loop	arrays
if you want to be strict about it quite frankly blake512_hash shouldn t return uint8_t arrays in the first place if you are expecting char arrays as the output all the time you could simply call in your for-loop and remove memcpy

10201946
j2ssh	jsch
i tried jsch orion j2ssh java api s to connect

10201969
min	max
if the min max interval contains 0 then an optimal solution can be realized as a convex combination of these two solutions

10202102
free	malloc
then when you use a new expression it ll invoke the class operator new to allocate the memory and that will call malloc so will end up allocating memory via malloc and likewise when you delete it it ll use operator delete which will call free

10202102
free	malloc
of course it uses operator new and operator delete instead of malloc and free like i ve used above

10202105
for-loop	loops
you declared a for-loop inside the while loops

10202107
sudo	passwd
in order to do that you probably need to be root or in the sudo config have passwd not require a passwd for your user to run

10202145
free	malloc
since the user is free to declare their mutexes as auto variables or declare them as pointers to memory allocated from malloc 3 i m skeptical of storing the mutex structures on a global linked list -- it sounds too likely that one of them will go out of scope and lead to garbage

10202152
hide	show
for better or for worse i ve got tons of logic in my views like this to determine which elements to show hide based on values which are stored in the database typically from reading incoming post data beforehand and saving it off to the database first

10202152
hide	show
i m wondering if there s a simple way i can still use the existing logic ie show this form or hide that form without having to write a bunch of jquery code in my template which i m guessing would need to access all those elements directly and require a bunch of new logic

10202163
heroku	engineyard
i m in australia which doesn t have an equivalent to heroku or engineyard and i need australian hosting as the data my app will consume output needs to stay in australia

10202347
strcpy	strncpy
you can only use functions like strcpy strncpy strcat and strncat safely if you know the lengths of the strings both the target buffers and the source strings and you know the foibles of the function you re calling mdash

10202347
memcpy	memmove
you can use memmove or memcpy

10202365

width	height
hi you should give parent position relative and child absolute and give to height or width to absolute class as like this

10202684
ttabsheet	tframe
another option is to place your components onto a tframe -derived class at design-time then create an instance of that class at run-time and place it onto each ttabsheet letting it handle the controls for you eg

10202697
width	height
change your imageview width height attributes to like this

10202732
accessor	properties
the properties declaration provides a clear explicit specification of how the accessor methods behave

10202778
implements	extends
i never saw it as an anti-pattern for the interface and abstract class to extends implements a common ancestor

10202778
implements	extends
then when you get to your customer dao impl you indicate you implements the customer interface and then have chosen to fulfill that by extends the abstract class

10202778
implements	extends
this allows the abstract class and the customer interface to grow or change separately if either ever wanted to not extends implements the generic dao but the other did

10202797
solaris	aix

4 strcpy is used to copy strings so if you wan t to store to float or int gpa etc you need to use memcpy also the value from buffer should be converted using strol strod

10202878
portrait	landscape
if you just want to make sure that your app successfully supports landscape and portrait orientations you can implement shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation in your view controller

10202878
portrait	landscape
but if i have misunderstood what you re trying to do you re trying to do something more sophisticated than just supporting both landscape and portrait orientation let me know

10202947

getter	setter
however it s a nonsense example you can do this so you can access priv via getter and setter methods only

10204523
getter	setter
in this case var priv is always accessible via a getter and a setter method

10204525
hide	show
the workflow is kind of a wizard using navigation buttons that hide show div s

the easiest way to achieve this is by using arrays.sort to first sort your arrays and then a simple for-loop will show where the last index is

10205013
inherited	properties
2 properties synthesized to a variable name starting with underbar _ no explicit backing variable unless i need inherited classes to be able to modify a read only variable internally in which case i need to move it to the public interface and i still name it with an underbar to indicate to myself that it is a properties variable

10205013
getter	setter
in this case if i only override the getter or setter not both i will still synthesize to _ and override the desired method no need for explicit variable

10205018
min	max
where i have to query for the max and min dates and print the new view as

10205018

if we start from this then decltype is basically giving us what would be t in this template and auto is giving us what would be x in this template

10205430
decltype	auto
i suspect the similarity to template type deduction made it much easier for the committee to accept auto and decltype into the language -- they basically just add new ways of accessing the type deduction that s already needed for function templates

10205592
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml

10205628
screens	tablet
typically you would provide images in various densities so icons etc look good on all devices but if you re building an app to work well on devices of very different sizes small phones through to 10 tablet you should also provide layouts for the various sizes of screens - perhaps one for phones one for 7 tablet and one for 10 tablet

earlier in the project nhibernate was warning that i was not overriding equals and gethashcode to circumvent lots of code changes and to promote code re-use i made a compositebaseentity class

10205863
equals	gethashcode
as there are two keys to compare equality against we must override the equals gethashcode methods to become something like

10205955
oncreate	onstart
oncreate onstart and onresume are lifecycle methods called by the operating system and shouldn t be called directly

10206104
post	get
i know the second example is impossible you can t get get and post data at the same time or so i know but the idea is that whether the page gets a get or a post variable it should turn it into variables automatically

10206421
mouseup	mousedown
and also try using mousedown followed by mouseup instead of click

10206467
int	chars
edit everything works without fault if i make it an int or chars vector but it needs to do all 3

10206495
width	height
if you want the width and height to be relative to to browser window use

10206502
mouse	keyboard
you can use your own arrow clips and mouse events instead of keyboard but the logic is the same

10206513
junit	jmock
i know that junit and jmock everything is a class in java so there s no choice but i guess that the ability to descend from a class with nothing but virtual functions is probably the mechanism that allows googlemock to do its work.

10206518
post	put	post	get	put	get
entity body is not allowed with get request so you will have to resort some other http method put or post if you need to send data in the entity body which in your case is not semantically correct

10206574
free	malloc
use new and instead of malloc and free

10206574
free	malloc
malloc and free are c s memory management functions so they have no idea about

though in theory you might have a system that buffers ram with a battery or a system that has a huge dedicated disk cache which is also battery powered

free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
never mix new delete with malloc free realloc

10207120
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
and malloc free realloc on non-pod types like std string yields undefined behaviour

10207120
realloc	malloc
using new malloc realloc on non-pod types means that your program loses any defined behaviour

you should be fine with string int double etc

10207293

10207913
free	malloc
if the user hits control-c while the program is in the middle of malloc or free and thus half way through manipulating the data structures they use to track heap allocations you will almost certainly corrupt the heap if you call malloc or free in the signal handler

10207939
width	height
you may try to replace the width 682 height 268 with

10208129

10208677
rss	feed
or the its complimentry rss feed as this will offer no resistance to being read

10208782
clutter	pygobject
i suspect it may be harder than usual to introspect the contents of clutter since it uses pygobject to pull the objects out of the shared c library but if i look at the contents of the module using the in-ide python debugger the objects within the package all show up

10208814

10209112
cpu	processors
you re limited to 33ms per frame otherwise you ll be lagging behind too slow cpu or too slow code if you can t hit this target you won t be running at 30 hz and if you hit it under 33ms then you can yield processors time effectivly freeing up resources

10209116
onclick	onchange
to fit your requirement you can give a go button besides your select tag and call the same function onclick that you would normally do with the onchange event of select element

post	get
i want to post message on friends wall and also how to get friends list and personal details from facebook

10209222
getter	setter
that s not only because autofixture doesn t invoke the setter but because moq doesn t by default implement the getter

10209233
fseek	fread
the path to the text-files is passed to the functions as a string char then opened using then multiple calls to fread and fseek are used

10209233
fseek	fread
i replaced the fread call by memcpy as shown but i m missing the return value of fread actual read items and in the original code the filepointer was moved by fseek i wonder whether my approach using a temporary pointer is correct

10209233
fseek	fread
my ultimate goal is to simulate the fread and fseek calls for resources with similar function prototypes

10209243
asterisk	freeswitch
suppose the clients are phones connected to internet using a dialer and the server is a sip server running asterisk freeswitch or something like that

10209249
packets	multicast
there really isn t anything magic save for once you join a multicast group your tcp stack indicates that it is interested in packets to that address and it gets passed up

10209249

i have several uiimageview as subviews of a uiview that act as a canvas

10209446
tesseract	leptonica
it probably means your tiff image has an alpha channel and therefore the underlying leptonica library used by tesseract doesn t support it

10209446
tesseract	leptonica
tesseract well leptonica accepts pngs these days and is less picky about them so it might be easier to migrate your workflow to png anyway

10209720
google-chrome	firefox
simply uses the ie algorithms within firefox and google-chrome for specific sites

10209739
gridview	sqldatasource
since you re using an sqldatasource with the gridview already i would say using the allowsorting property of the gridview in your markup would be your easiest bet

10209739
gridview	sqldatasource
you could just change the selectcommand in your sqldatasource to end with order by added desc . this would be ideal if you do not want the sorting to be a dynamic user-prompted event but just a static default sorting of the gridview that does not change

10209791
post	get
every time i execute the post method i get back a 404

10209845

i have mentioned ssis package files and i tried to open it with business intelligence development studio on sql server 2005 - it resulted with an error which informs i need another version of it - i think it ment bids with sql server 2008

this results in for example the min and max values for different floating point formats taking on strange-looking values

10210435
wakelock	powermanager
use the powermanager with a partial wakelock to help your service run when the screen is off - but note this feature does not work on all devices - of all the devices i have used this feature works on half but not perfect

i have an unsigned char array and i am trying to access bytes 2-3 0xff and 0xff and get their value as a short

10210537
min	max
have a look at crosstab queries used with min max and last

10210746
pull	push
i am quite a newb regarding git and usually git commit pull and push are the only commands i do

10210746
pull	push
maybe using a copy of a previous pull to push the original info

10210749
width	height
argb_8888 which is recommended allocates 4 bytes per pixel therefore the size will be width height 4 bytes

10210756

you re not using less-than-or-equals greater-than-or-equals everywhere so it s not going to include values which are equal to the max or min

10210889
hide	show	tabcontrol	tabitem
what we ended up doing was creating a special tabcontrol i called it tabcontrolex which keeps all items rendered but chooses to simply show hide the contentpresenters for the tabitem

10210937
hide	show
you will notice images need to be fully loaded in order to run the slider this may not look very good so you will probably want to hide .mydiv while loading and show it once images are in place please refer to jquery toogle for this

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the font weight issues can be seen in mac google-chrome but they are instantly faux-bold in mac firefox and safari

10211033
getter	setter
i know that the property generates the getter and setter in objective-c

10211042
postgresql	mysql
i wish it could be simpler but usually the client server frontends to databases offload much of the concurrency issues so you don t witness it as much with oracle mysql postgresql etc.

10211048

convert int to chars and i think it will work fine

10211356
getter	setter
i know that the property generates the getter and setter in objective-c

10211356
getter	setter
property declares a property which is a getter and optionally a setter for read write properties

10211356
getter	setter
the generation of the getter and setter is done by the synthesize in the implementation or by you writing the getter and setter

10211356
getter	setter
just to confuse you a bit in the very latest compiler you can omit the synthesize and the compiler will put it in for you as long as you haven t explicitly created a getter or setter

10211358
post	get
i spent a day trying to get the sample source into a project to test the post on wall

10211372

versioning	upgrade
btw after the upgrade here s my eclipse versioning in case you want to compare your current versioning to mine

10211855
sorting	grouping
instead knowing that we want to grouping by these columns we can make the application code to do so simpler by sorting by these fields

10211855
aggregate-functions	sum
this should be done in your application code after applying the aggregate-functions you want suppose we want to sum over col4 and take the max of col5

10211855

stdout	stderr
one thing you could do is capture the program s stdout and or stderr streams and look for specific patterns or at least anything at all

10212112
width	height
i think there are some processing image loading altering the width height of some elements etc after document .ready before something .mouseenter

10212138
ready	each
requestanimationframe function works like a timer calling to the render function each time the browser is ready to update the web page

10212139
button	checkbox
for instance in the below project clicking the button or the checkbox will be reflected on the form appearance but writing in the memo will not

10212165
addclass	removeclass
also when u do addclass removeclass toggleclass u don t need to use dot . in class name

10212515
rsa	aes
i ve been playing around with rsa pkcs and aes encription

10212515
rsa	aes
what it does is encrypting the data with the symmetric aes system which uses a random key generated on-the-fly cyphers the password used for aes using the rsa pkcs#1 system and puts it in the result to be sent

10212515
rsa	aes
as you can see the aes password is encrypted with the server s rsa key

10212549

this will read any .txt files in a folder named dirlists and for every line in each file do a copy from the dir specified by that line to the target dir .

10213185
client-side	server-side
reading around my understanding is that the current best practice for applying the dry principle in creating crawlable ajax-generated websites as described above is to use a templating engine that can use the same templates on the client-side and the server-side

10213185
ember.js	backbone.js
how advisable is it to combine those client-side templates with a front-end mvc mv mvvc framework like backbone.js ember.js or yui app library

you can use show and hide methods

10213305
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this solution has been tested in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

10213324
hide	show
if you choose this example you could could also think about adding a button to show hide all that you can achieve by using

10213337
put	get
when trying to make an example program like matrixmul i get an extensive amount of errors most of which are unknown type name size_t . i ve made sure to put usr local cuda bin in my path as well as usr local cuda lib in a .conf in etc ld.so.conf.d

10213435
folder	directory
also a quick tip on structuring sti in your app if you find that you have a lot of models that use sti like a productcategory commentcategory phonecategory clientcategory that all inherit from cateogory - i tend to organize them in folder inside model directory

10213440
google-chrome	firefox
that works for firefox and google-chrome

10213442
addition	multiplication
the operations multiplication addition can be implemented without loss in accuracy too

10213448

10213448
postgresql	mysql
because i think the find_in_set works in mysql but not postgresql

10213452
textblock	itemscontrol
this will display all items in your itemscontrol with a textbox which uses your mytextboxstyle and your textblock with the mytextblockstyle

10213464
ant	maven
i found out how to do it with ant and antrun-plugin though it is very complicated i had much trouble with antrun plugin versions unable to make a recent version work even for a basic task and i d really like to stick to maven

10213464
ant	maven
if someone knows how to do the equivalent with je jacoco maven plugin instead of ant i m interested

put	get
create a get the map.entryset put it into a and sort it

10214164
for-loop	arrays
i m using preg_match instead of preg_match_all because from what i understand the for-loop is supposed to repeat based on the value of num_parts so using preg_match_all will just build an arrays of all those src elements instead of matching them one at time

10214174
centos	linux
i have micro instance free with amazon linux ami and i want to change to centos ami

10214244

10214276
width	height
and possibly explicitly define the width and height

10214278
gif	png
there is so much needed information for an image it would be an extremely lengthy parameter list for a method to accept raw bytes and create an imagine is it a bitmap jpeg gif png etc and all the additional data each of those requires to create a valid image it wouldn t make sense

10214302
put	get
you have to use getbyte method to get the bytes and the put these bytes into a datagram packet instance and then pass it to the client or send it.

10214331
post	get
when editing a post i get all the buttons

10214331

a call as malloc 0 before any calloc etc

10214527
calloc	malloc
here i have also added malloc 0 before any calloc

10214548
uiview	calayer
as you probably know uiview is built on top of calayer which is in turn a sort of wrapper for opengl textures

10214591
spaces	delimiter
for example if you have one set of files that is spaces delimiter and the other that is underscore delimiter load both with the same mapper and textinputformat and tokenize on both possible delimiter

10214813
gprof	perf
if you are using linux then you can use linux perf instead of gprof as described here

10214829
concave	convex
i m looking for a method for finding an axis-aligned rectangle inside a concave or convex polygon

10214829
concave	convex
i ve been looking around the web the closest solutions i could find would only fit a convex polygon and not a concave one

10214869
width	margin
that the width of the viewâ s left margin is fixed but that the viewâ s

10214869
width	margin
width and right margin may change

10214873
width	height
but it seems when i set the width and height of a canvas to 100 it doesn t really make it as high and as wide as parent

10214873
width	height
i don t want to hardcode the height and width of canvas because it should change dynamically when viewed in bigger or smaller screen including mobile devices

10214971
width	height
use the width and height attributes of the canvas if you want it to actually be as big as the parent element

10214971
width	height
if you use the css height and width attributes then you are just stretching the canvas

10214975

10215056
rsa	aes
instead you typically use rsa in conjunction with some symmetric-key aka private key encryption algorithm such as aes

10215069
width	height
try setting i may be mistaken but when this is set to true the view might scale to 0 width and 0 height when it doesn t have an image

10215079
int	boolean
boolean and int values should be set without quotes

10215079
width	height
since the width height and type are your fancybox settings they should go inside the fancybox function not in the ajax function

10215079
width	height
also notice that we set autoscale to false to make sure that you will get the size as in your width height options

10215151

the for-loop will show both objects in the arrays

10215562
filtering	grouping
with linq-to-object it probably makes little difference but with linq-to-sql or linq-to-ef etc. the grouping operation is performed on the database server rather than the client and so you may want to do an additional filtering on the grouping key which generates a having clause and then only get some of the grouping instead of all of them

you may set x_test_request true and post to and check if you get a valid transaction id back

width	height
the width and height attributes on a canvas specify the number of pixels of data to draw to like the actual pixels in an image and are separate from the display size of the canvas

10215724
width	height
it creates a js function shown below to both set a canvas to be the same display size as its positioned parent and then adjusts the internal width and height properties so that is has the same number of pixels as it shows

10215728
subscript	superscript
besides using css3 to allows the programmer to use custom fonts safely you could just superscript or subscript a b or a #

10215911
ssms	sqlcmd
but i ve shown that both ssms and sqlcmd can be made to work so i hope that gets you closer to running

10215911
ssms	sqlcmd
so unless you need sqlcmd access in the short term i would have the secondary users do their thing with ssms once you ve granted adequate permissions and hopefully krzysztof will have more info on the other items

width	height
i just used firebug edited the html with the height and width and it worked fine

for windows lxml provides prebuilt eggs with libxml2 and libxslt staticly compiled in as stated in the lxml install documentation so you do not need to install them separately

int	double
the random number generator will produce a random double from two random int values

10217354
int	double
the internal seed has 48 bit so the random sequence repeats after at most 2 48 int values or 2 47 double values

10217392

for simple get post requests you can simply return an access-control-allow-origin header for more complex requests with other methods you ll need additional headers which can be found on the above resources

textarea	autogrow
you can also use the jquery autogrow textarea plugin

10217732
int	boolean
i ve had people do this and it took me forever to figure out why what i thought was a boolean or an int was a string

10217732
int	boolean
php s boolean true and false will get casted to the corresponding int and you won t have a problem using 0 1 in javascript

10217739
post	get
so a think that i have to create php file that will get the first letters that in the search box end calculate the appropriated post via wordpress filters

10217740
width	height
if you need good browser support or you need the content to reflow properly you ll have to make do with an alternative such as using javascript or restructuring your html such that the width and height properties will scale it correctly and affect element flow in a natural way

i have extracted the datatables-1.9.1 folder but i don t know where to place it in my c xampp directory

10217864
width	height
in order to enable virtualization the radgridview control needs to have bounded width and height

10217864
width	height
putting a radgridview inside a scrollviewer gives it infinite width and height which disables the virtualization

10217864
width	height
my suggestion is to bound the width and height of the grid using the maxwidth and maxheight properties and then take the grid out of the scrollviewer you ve wrapped it in

10217913
int	chars

10217924
converter	multibinding
i tried to use the multibinding with a converter like this

10217945
width	height
you are right that the scrollviewer simply lets the radgridview determine it s own size unconstrained and therefore it will fill up the width to accomodate all of it s columns and the height to accomodate all of the rows

10217945
width	height
you shouldn t have any width or height set on the radgridview because you want them set as auto the default to grow or shrink appropriately

10217975

like tudor has recommend i would also use a parallel_for pattern algorithm from either intel tbb or microsoft ppl

10218445
uiview	subviews
i suggest you subclass an uiview and implement the drawrect method so the view knows how to draw itself and implement the touchesended method in your view controller where you can check if you have touched a squareview then remove it from view controller s view otherwise create a squareview and add it as subviews to the view controller s view

10218492
post	get
furthermore note that the above click-handler does not post or get the page to the server

10218512

tabs	tabpanel
it would mean the actual tabs will also be removed from your tabpanel

10218602
tabs	tabpanel
that way the tabbar can have several tabs and the container fake tabpanel can pretend to have several items but only have 1 2

10218625

10218712
post	put
post is always meant to post stuff to some kind of factory to be handled by it - otherwise you could just use put

10218712
post	put
and this is also the difference between put and post if the client is in charge of handling the resource you use put because you know what to put and where to put it

10218729
int	chars
how can i convert couple of chars to int to keep the question simple let s assume this

10218785

mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
i created a menu and i tried to use mouseover mouseenter and mouseout mouseleave but unfortunately if you move the mouse too fast some of the events are not fired and the hover images are not changed back to the original image

10219209
mouseover	mouseout
i need to use mouseover and mouseout events instead of hover because i need to display the original image if the image is clicked

10219210
implements	extends
make your class bimpl abstract and add a view method to it which is implements by the specific classes extends your abstract base class

10219215
nsstring	nsdata
nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

10219239
put	get
i would like my lcd to display voltage sensorvalue but right now the only way i can get the program to recognize the value as i turn the potentiometer is if i put it in a loop

10219244
post	put	post	get	put	get
however i do know that only checked checkboxes will get send back to the server on a get or post so if you know what names these checkboxes you can get them from the request object and put them in a array

10219269
hide	show
this is the function i used to hide show columns by their sortexpression

10219273

the primitive integral data types byte sbyte ushort short chars uint int ulong long are are always stored in the computer s memory in binary format

10219301
profiler	yourkit
in the course of profiling a 64-bit java app that s having some issues i notice that the profiler itself yourkit is using truly colossal amounts of memory

10219304
mouseover	mouseout
you should use one element per icon and switch the class and image src when mouseover and mouseout are fired

10219316
post	put	post	get	put	get
instead if you want to continue using a restful implementation then you will need to change your server side api to map the create read update and destroy methods to post get put and delete respectively

10219320
free	malloc
when you free memory it goes back to malloc

10219349
width	height
i m having trouble using the drawoval x y width height method which assumes that the x and y values represent the coordinates of the upper left corner of the oval to be drawn javadoc

10219379
profiling	instrumentation
a window should pop up asking you to select an instrumentation to profiling your app with

10219412
width	height
a simple solution if you have the width height declared in advance would be to use the drawoval method as follows

10219412
width	height
let s say x y is 10 10 and you want to draw an oval of height width 10 10

10219473
qmainwindow	qwidget
you need to inherit from qmainwindow not qwidget

10219515
awt	swing
i just realized that there are two graphical categories called swing and awt and i looked at some awt code and it looked quite a bit different than what i have been using

10219525
twig	smarty
and yes i know and used engines like smarty twig etc. but the goal is to use plain php with the language elements it provides and maybe a bit more but not using php to parse a template file to generate an automaton array php-file or whatever out of it

10219546
google-chrome	firefox
when child elements start inheriting width the table with width 100 they are given a width equal to that of the browser causing them to overflow off the right of the page and create a horizontal scrollbar in firefox or not float and be pushed down in google-chrome

10219566
post	get
i can get the post that i want but i just can t seem to figure out how to sort them the way i would like

10219575
yslow	pagespeed
if you are worried about page performance 80 of the problem lies in the front-end so try to optimize your html css and javascript by checking your page against yslow pagespeed etc

10219627
gradle	ivy
i m migrating from ant ivy to gradle and am trying to understand how you specify a relative path to the local ivy repo

10219669

i m using this to show hide some divs at the end i have a button to show the divs one by one

10219669
hide	show
by default all fields are hidden so i need a button to show them all at once i have 14 divs to show hide

10219675
hide	show
have a button with a function that selects all of the divs by a class that you ll have to add and hide show them

10219680
apache	nginx
i know the standard way to do this through nginx or htaccess for apache

10219716
tunnel	vpn
another technology that you may want to consider is ipsec tunnel vpn if your device supports ipsec passthrough

10219751
getter	setter
i ve modified your code by giving element position and orientation fields which you might want to expose through getter setter probably defensively copying the point instance before returning setting it

10219765
screens	tablet
if you wan t your app to run only in tablet you should filter the devices allowed by screens size adding the following code to your manifest

10219780
mouse	keyboard
all my objects on screen are called entity and they are capable to implement an interface called entityactionlistener wich allows to interact with the mouse the keyboard to move on the screen etc

10219822
put	get
i modified to get it to convert my html into an image put the html on another webpage and pass that url to the script

10219854
awt	swing
this method does the same as invalidate but in awt event dispatching thread i will just call it swing thread later on

10219902
subtract	add
i got the following code that add multiple subtract divide in the same matrix but when i run it it returns only 0 or sometime 2 -0 -2 etc.

10219903
hide	show
this gives me the products and locations but is missing the groupings by supplier or any way of isolating the supplier so i can hide show them with js

10219904
popupwindow	pop-up
i have a pop-up i want to show at the location of the clicked link - and i wish to reuse the same popupwindow

10219916
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have created a new asp.net web application but the controls for scriptmanager and updatepanel are missing

10219952
swt	swing
the best way is to use either swing javafx or swt to create rich desktop applications on java

10219977
google-chrome	firefox
expect to see this api live in google-chrome and firefox later this year

10219999
post	get
in your page_load handler use the page.ispostback property to determine whether the page is loading for a get or post and use the request properties described above

10220009
opera	firefox
only major holdbacks are firefox on osx some linux opera android less than v4.4 works only if you format it a certain way

10220023
interbase	firebird
there can be side effects to quoting field names for example in firebird interbase quoting a field name will make it case sensitive while they are normally case insensitive

10220068
setinterval	settimeout
this is really simple without the setinterval or even settimeout

10220070
sudo	passwd
when running as root sudo doesn t ask for a passwd

10220079
post	get
get all post

10220099
ant	maven
i have a build.gradle file which loads a href rel noreferrer pmd a downloading it from upstream maven and then loads an ant build.xml file which requires pmd

10220101
sudo	passwd
you could configure sudo to not prompt for a passwd

10220101
sudo	passwd
you could write an expect script to read the passwd and supply it to sudo when required but that s clunky and fragile

10220137
put	get
if i put values using into wolfram alpha i actually get the presumably correct output the example in the link is the input of var_z shown in the logs at the bottom of this question

10220156
post	put
does not make a difference whether i set the method to put or post the behavior is the same

10220200
sudo	passwd
just sudo to invoke your script in the first place it will prompt for the passwd once

10220223
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox google-chrome

10220253
comparator	comparable
we all know if we want a class to be comparable and use in sorting i.e datagrid we will implement comparator

10220257
post	get
so you use vk.api photos.getuploadserver ... to get the post url

10220280
post	get
that works fine but when i am trying to get a list of the latest blog post a user has created i get an error

10220281
implements	extends
my sensordataprovider class extends contentprovider and implements sensoreventlistener

10220282
bluetooth	usb
it covers usb ethernet and bluetooth printing

10220283
post	get
i get location and type from form in another page using post

10220302
bluetooth	usb
star micronics has an sdk for android printing via bluetooth as well as ethernet and usb

10220306
hide	show
for an excellent example see norm estrabrook s post show and hide context menu items in outlook 2010

10220309
udp	tcp
it doesn t mean what the functions of tcp or udp are but the layer itself

10220318
content-disposition	content-type
i ve tried to change the response headers like content-type and content-disposition but i had sucess with it

10220329
udp	tcp
i have an in-house app not for iphone store distribution so not subject to apple approval which needs to keep a handful of tcp and udp sockets bound while it is running

10220343
oncreate	ondestroy
a better option is to use allocatehwnd to allocate a separate dedicated hwnd just for handling the hot key messages then you can use the oncreate and ondestroy events again eg

10220360
integer	unsigned
in aes.php at line 230 there is hex number 0x100000000 which is not valid signed 32-bit integer in fact it requires at least 33 bits even if unsigned some php versions will throw an error or notice about it older mostly

10220369
comparator	icomparer
many of the places where comparator can be used will also accept icomparer

10220380
next	except
giving the code a quick look i would guess that one of your controllers next or previous is nil and since you can t insert nil into an nsarray except as the last object it is throwing an error

10220383
children	parent
i need a parent div to automatically resize when it s children do

10220383
children	parent
if you add a height to the parent div the children show up but i d like it to auto size to the children

10220383
children	parent
it s because the children base their height on it s parent and when the parent doesn t have a height the children height is then 0

10220414
width	height
to fix it you can set the gear width and height to 40px that s the size of the image anyway -- i don t see the need for it to be 100px x 100px and then re-position it accordingly

10220424
width	height
what you should do instead is call your rest service with a url that includes parameters to pass into the control such as and then reference them within the control using param.get height and param.get width

10220456
apache	nginx
in most cases a rewrite rule is used in apache or nginx or whatever webserver is being used so the url can be in the form

10220464
post	put
i m actually asking if i can put the parameters that are always the same somewhere else from fromname username password host post smtpsecure smtpauth

10220471
children	parent
if the parent is zero and the children are 60 height of the parent they would also be zero

10220490
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox but google-chrome won t animate them

10220502
median	max
for example if your reducer is doing just a sum or a max it respects both properties but something like mean or median does not and thus you can not use it as a combiner

10220508
rss	feed
then when i add content it shows on top of my flash and my rss feed

10220516
post	get
i guess one option is not to encrypt the log file but to suppress all the parameter values that get logged for post requests by rails

10220523
pop-up	dialog
a dialog should pop-up for you to enter the info during the download

10220530
client-side	server-side
it s a ratio of server-side versus client-side

10220531
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
i am working in a lab where we are running linux debian and ubuntu

10220532

and you run your script in your home folder all .sql inside directory b d f will have the checksum calculated and piped to a file md5sum in the current directory

10220634
packets	pcap
i know pcap library can be used to capture packets for any protocol

10220645
shadowing	named
the problem is shadowing when you declare a variable inside a method with the same named as a member variable it shadows the member variable

10220656
bluetooth	usb
an alternative is star micronics sdk for android printing via usb ethernet and bluetooth

10220673
put	get
i would like my lcd to display voltage sensorvalue but right now the only way i can get the program to recognize the value as i turn the potentiometer is if i put it in a loop

10220725
folder	directory
for some reason i can t find the existing maven archetype that just zips up the source directory and puts it into the target folder

10220739
lzma	lzw
depending on whether you prefer fast and simple or high compression ratio you could take a look into the lempel-ziv-welch lzw or lempel-ziv-markov chain lzma algorithms

10220743
equals	icomparable
here is the overloaded equals method in the public class order icomparable

10220743
for-loop	arrays
in main i try to create the 2 arrays so i can compare 1 to the other and check for dups as i go through with a nested for-loop but it is not working

10220743
for-loop	arrays
it just continues filling the arrays as if it never saw the second for-loop

10220754
stateless	stateful
the stateless nature of web applications usually requires a totally different design than stateful desktop apps

10220763
int	chars
for example a platform needs int should be aligned with 4 so 0x12345 can be void or chars but if you assigned it to int crash happened

10220763
unsigned	short
you can cast the void pointer to unsigned char first then convert 2 unsigned chars to unsigned short

10220777
superclass	subclassing
you can use nscfconstantstring anywhere an nsstring could be used due to subclassing superclass relationship but obviously not the other way around

10220780
cfstring	nsstring
your nscfstring is just a toll-free bridged string that can be an nsstring or a cfstring

10220781
width	height
when i say size i mean width and height

10220781
width	height
if i set the image control height and width the images are distorted

10220801
for-loop	loops
notice how i added wronginput so that right after the second for-loop it throws back to the beginning of the outer loops

10220813
width	height
in your html you should specify the actual height and width of the file

10220813
width	height
if you truly want to make an image 300x250 then you ll need to use tools like the gimp photoshop or imagemagick to resize and or crop it to the desired height and width

10220815
width	height
try setting either width or height

10220837
width	height
while displaying image you check the height width and make them smaller only if it exceeds your desirable limits

10220837
width	height
for all approaches if images have smaller height width than the ones you want then you would just have to leave them as it is otherwise they will get distorted

10220857
gif	png
basic gif and png encoding

10220860
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade my mysql versioning from mysql5.0 to mysql5.5

10220863
google-chrome	firefox
edit i also use google-chrome and often firefox and google-chrome work when ie fails

10220875
menhir	ocamlyacc
while you can also write your own parser using a tool like menhir or ocamlyacc to do it for you is a very versatile and quick solution compared to messing around with the yuckiness of dealing with non ll 1 things in a simple recursive descent parser

10220932
folder	directory
and of course as the image folder directory isn t included the image will not display

10220953
spaces	linefeed
those characters includes spaces and as called out explicitly in section 5 of 2368 cr and linefeed

10220974
fastboot	adb
the second one is when you connect your phone to the pc switch it to fastboot mode with adb reboot bootloader or switching off on and holding some buttons and then use fastboot to perform rom update magic

10220974
fastboot	adb
issue exec or system calls to run adb reboot bootloader and then fastboot flash commands then finally fastboot reboot

10220974
fastboot	adb
if you have done everything correctly catch and process the output of adb and fastboot to check the results your device will get reflashed and rebooted

10221007
post	get
here is another post that is similar and it also links to another post that was having the same problem that from what i can tell didn t get answered clearly at least as far as i can tell

10221011
int	boolean
essentially i copy and past the boolean method but i make it parse an int instead

10221027
post	get
i ll see if i can get an answer from them and amend this post if when i do

10221030
bellman-ford	dijkstra
the bellman-ford algorithm takes o vâ e where the dijkstra s takes o e + vlogv time

10221057
hide	show
if you temporarily hide the headers you will get an outline of your buffer move where you want then show the code again

10221103
pull	push
you should be able to see which branches are configured for pull and push with

10221172
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox but in ie8 9 the uploadprogress callback not called

10221174

10221298
google-chrome	firefox
but this script is not working in firefox google-chrome

10221298
google-chrome	firefox
please suggest any good solution to work in firefox google-chrome

10221311
int	chars
there is a newline chars at the end of each line and int is not happy

10221311
for-loop	loops
also python can loops over a string with an ordinary for-loop so you can get a 5-character slice and loops over it to multiply the five digits together

10221327
int	double
i am confused to as why the java point class takes in two int paramaters and the getx and gety methods return double

10221334
int	chars
the problem is you are trying to turn a new line chars n into an int

10221350
hide	show
i now have the need to hide certain recipes meaning they will never show up in any search ever

10221358
arraylist	linkedhashmap
i got a performance boost from switching from an arraylist initially to the linkedhashmap but it s still taking a long time

10221370
google-chrome	firefox
sorry but you can t copy stuff into the clipboard in google-chrome or firefox

10221397
int	double
the double variable can sometimes be a whole int but can also be a fractions

10221430
children	parent
my page layout is set to 2 column with left bar the default category is and all the children in my category structure are set to use parent

10221437
put	get
i will get 0 as result since the 5 and the 10 are temporarily stored in an int where we do the division and then we put it in a float

10221442
post	get
what you want here is to join the tables and get those rows in post that would normally be excluded by the join

10221442
post	get
if you run this query and get the expected set of rows post that do not have likes or dislikes by that user then you can add an outer query to count the number of returned rows

10221442
post	get
2nd edit this inner query will get you those post that have either value 1 in the taxi table or no value at all which results in 4 being returned for your example

10221451
mouseover	mouseout
i also tied them together through mouseover and mouseout events so that mousing over or out of any element causes all elements in a set to change color simultaneously

10221503
width	height
however the video stream is missing important information such as width height and pixel format which then causes av_find_stream_info to fail

10221511
ubuntu	debian
both debian and ubuntu ship with pam_umask

10221511
ubuntu	debian
note that users may still override umask in their own .profile or .bashrc or similar but at least on new debian and ubuntu installations there shouldn t be any overriding of umask in etc profile or etc bash.bashrc

10221520
unification	inference
i m pretty sure java s type inference isn t powerful enough to handle unification

10221569
hide	show
my sidebar has a width of 50 and i want that whenever the mouse is towards the right of that it hide and then when the mouse enters the 50 zone the sidebar show again

10221617
macports	homebrew
take a look at launch available here also easy to install using homebrew or macports

10221622
floating-point	integer
because the floating-point value is of a higher rank than an integer it will promote the integer to a float

10221628
hash	md5
however md5 has been broken so you should use some other hash function instead like sha-256

10221628
hash	salt
it s also worth noting that to really do this securely you should salt the passwords before your hash them to prevent rainbow-table attacks

10221732
inherited	properties
that means a structure that can have properties and has can have a prototype object it inherited from

10221747
mouseleave	mouseenter
but instead it s that you want to simply have actions fire on mouseenter and mouseleave hover

10221747
hide	show
without having to predict the position of the mouse we can simply dictate when to show and when to hide the content

10221749
qthread	qobject
i wanted to create qobject object with the child qthread thread with that object as parent for keeping thread alive while object is alive and make object.movetothread thread but signal to start the thread isn t working in this case

10221777
hash	md5
you re also right in mentioning that md5 is a one way hash so you won t be able to transform it back into the original string

10221828
solaris	aix
what i should use on aix hpux and solaris to get the similar information or there any cross platform command

10221831
devise	cancan
i have created an app which uses devise and cancan for authentication and authorization

10221838
puts	gets
performance for gets and puts in a smidgeon faster since there is no need to maintain a list structure

10221862
post	put
use httpconnection to your server and put location co-ordinates with device id in post data

10221862
post	put
in post data you can use json or xml to put your values whatever you want as device id location co-ordinates and more whatever you want

10221871
hide	show
the links make the div called hiddendiv hide and show

10221946
free	malloc
you might be doing this already but every time you malloc anything make sure you have a corresponding free in your code once you re done with it

10221946
calloc	malloc
when you create structs that have pointers in them an easy way to do this is to use calloc instead of malloc to create the struct since calloc returns memory which is always zeroed

10221952
next	except
you can use wso2 middleware stack to achieve your requirement except for ws-humantask support which will be available in the next release

10221999
free	malloc
all the malloc ed memory must be free ed

10222027

folder	directory
i am getting this error by running . zf.sh from the same directory where the script is located which is my downloads folder at the moment

10222111
implements	extends
remember you can only extends one class real or abstract but implements multiple interfaces

10222129
mouseover	mouseout
the best way i can see to do this would be to bind each of the events and make it so that during the mouseover event if the div is clicked the mouseout event gets unbinded

10222183
post	get
if you want to just get some data by id you post use this

10222197
disk	ram
i am trying to measure cpu disk i o ram usage

10222200
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on ie9 google-chrome firefox

10222227
google-chrome	firefox
if that doesn t work you need to inspect the request using a developing tool within google-chrome or firefox

10222238
outputstream	inputstream
consider using one common inputstream to outputstream copier method which works in both situations like ioutils.copy

10222242
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval as well as settimeout require a reference to a function

10222292
jar	war
so create separate project for war jar and build

as my friend says me they uses partition by partition-by keyword for their means and as i can see from fetch-the-row-which-has-the-max-value-for-a-column and getting-values-relating-to-the-max-and-min-rows-in-oracle there are two choices about using dense_rank with over order by ... and then bound that rank to 1 as described here and in fetch-the-row-which-has-the-max-value-for-a-column or use something like max version over partition by entity_id not row_id max_version and then bound version max_version in where causer like described in getting-values-relating-to-the-max-and-min-rows-in-oracle fetch-the-row-which-has-the-max-value-for-a-column and my friend says that they prefer exactly the second approach as i understood because it may require less calculation per each group since it only finds a maximum value and don t have to completely sort each group on the other hand if there will be more then one record with the same maximum value this query will select not the only one arbitrary chosen row with max value of ordering column in our case version but all rows from group that have that maximum value so that can return argmax - not only as a single row but also as a set of rows where it is achieved

hash	md5
first of all those actions should be followed by a password verification and second you should add a md5 hash signature verification to the end and verify that signature on the server.

10232869
hash	md5
also you should send the password in a one way hash format md5 or sha1 and verify the hash value with what you have in your web server database.

10232869
hash	md5
the md5signature should be the md5 hash value of all parameters id mail password and a secret password like mysecr3tpass

10232869
hash	md5
so if id 12 mail mymail mail.com and pass aerf124f the signature would be the md5 hash of 12mymail mail.comaerf124fmysecr3tpass which would be 0b9492395c9c1a73a6622cab5a6a4de5

to sort out your problem you must first set the min and max dates for the date axis axis x

10233111
min	max
apparently only when the min and max values are set the renderer will use the value of tickinterval

10233111
min	max
as it appears the setting of min max and tickinterval is not enough as the values are still not every 3 months as each tick shows 30th day and it should sometimes be 31

10233111
min	max
in this case you do not need min max and tickinterval any more

your parent proceses will handle the load balancing between children

10236451
hash	md5
add the -v option to the keytool parameter set and you ll get an md5 hash too

10236458
children	parent
however if you spawn children tasks after calling .getcurrentsession and before calling .commit you may run in to issues because other tasks may execute on this thread and .getcurrentsession would return the session used by the parent task

10236458
children	parent
this is almost certainly not what you want because the children tasks should presumably be doing the same thing as each other and you wouldn t want one arbitrarily sharing session state with the parent while others don t

10236477
post	get
however when i deploy the application to the webserver on 123reg httpverbs other than get and post appear to not reach my application at all initially a 401 not authorised response was returned

10236484
getter	setter
and you can also make gender a class scope variable so that you can access it with a setter getter

10236606
fflush	gets	stdout	fflush
but when i call it from an os.system or os.popen call in a python script on the same input file the output file the minified version of the js file gets truncated as though stdout were not getting fflush before the subprocess exits or as if jsmin were terminating early or as if maybe something were going on with disk buffering or something

10236606
stdout	fflush
the exit value is whatever i return from main even when the output is getting truncated and adding a call to fflush stdout doesn t make any difference and calling sync from within the same subshell after calling jsmin doesn t make any difference

10236606
put	get
i have put jsmin in the path and it is running i get most of the expected results in the .min file.

inherited	properties
i ve written a longer article about nested inherited in javascript on my blog which shows you how to define custom properties static methods static properties etc

10236731
hash	salt
the answers to this question provide examples of how one might hash a password in c# one answer includes information on doing a salt hash

10236759
client-side	server-side
this is mostly a client-side setting although it also has effects on the server-side and again it s specific to the nettcpbinding and cousins

10236767
subtract	add
in my app i need to allow users to do calculations such as add subtract divide values from rows in different tables

10236782
multiplying	add
you d create 10 vdsp_deq22 filters run your audio through each one multiplying that band by a specified gain and then add up the output of all the filters in the filter bank into your output audio

10236809
backgrounding	multitasking
quiescence how busy is the cpu multitasking other things in the backgrounding

10236824
hash	salt
you should salt your passwords and hash using a decent hashing algorithm

10236846
prepare	execute
it lets you execute dynamically prepare statements such as

10236847
post	get
the strange behavior is that i get duplicate post on the server and according to my appstats page i use 10x-20x more urlfetches than what was added with the code above

10236848
subtract	add
ok i have angle l currently 0 i add 45 or any angle and subtract 45 or any angle to get a and b my view angle

10236863
for-loop	loops
within this function a parent object is declared and a for-loop loops through the passed argument s length in this case keyarr creates new objects according the length of the passed argument

10236863
children	parent
the issue is that i am able to create the parent object mobj and children objects to mobj but am only able to assgin keys and values to the first child object obj0 not rest of the children objects correctly

10236869
memcached	apc
you can save data between requests using userland shared memory extensions for example apc xcache memcached etc

10236874
bazaar	git
git hg and bazaar are virtually equivalent for 95 of the features and probably most of the features that most users will ever want

10236897
put	get
however when using the rule as written it seems to be ignored and i get a 404 no matter what i put in

10236910
versioning	upgrade
the simplest solution is upgrade your work station to latest android sdk and eclipse adt plugin versioning at least r17 as this situation is automatically handled by the sdk now since r17 see the r17 changelog

10236920
portrait	landscape
when i first visit the page either in portrait or landscape - it looks fine

10236920
portrait	landscape
when i go from portrait to landscape the viewport is wider than the 590px and vice versa

10236923
inherited	properties
edit if you instead want to change the label of the radiobutton control you can use the labelattributes properties inherited from checkbox

10236954
postgresql	mysql
it s highly recommended to use dbms specific escape function mysqli_real_escape_string for mysql or pg_escape_string for postgresql

10236989
for-loop	arrays
the timestamp arrays goes undefined once it leaves the for-loop before it even leaves the function

10237010
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu sudo apt-get install gcc python-dev

10237021
ubuntu	linux
i have carried out memcpy tests of a 16mb data block for the different sizes of reserved ram resmem_length on ubuntu 10.04.4 linux 2.6.32 on a supermicro 1026gt-tf-fm109

10237021
memcpy	malloc
from the first to the second run memcpy from mmap ed to malloc ed seems to benefit that the contents might already be cached somewhere

10237023
tabs	tabpanel
i have an existing intranet webapp solely internal built with extjs using an iframe architecture it has a top menu and a tabpanel on an index page and about 30 other separate webpages that open as iframes tabs inside the main tabpanel

10237037
google-chrome	firefox
i m seeing it in google-chrome and i haven t really checked if it also happens in ie and firefox

10237074
for-loop	arrays
for a quick and easy fix consider serializing the length of the arrays as an integer before serializing the children use a for-loop or similar construct to read the values - or serializing the arraylist itself

10237119
hide	show
i have a javascript function that takes in the element id and hide or show the table

10237136
fadein	fadeout
i have tried fadetoggle fadein and fadeout

10237164
integer	unsigned
if you want the compiler to guarantee that your integer values always take up 32 bits of ram and will always wrap around at 2 31 or 2 32 for unsigned no matter what platform you re compiling on go with int32_t etc

10237164
int	chars
i think the chars short int long approach was more useful back in the early days of c when computer architecture was more varied and cpus were slow enough that achieving full native performance was more important than safe coding

10237168
pop-up	dialog
here is my code to pop-up the dialog

10237168
pop-up	dialog
oddly when i first pop-up the dialog i have to push a button on the dialog to load the form fields which works fine and loads the fields

10237200
thin	webrick
i uploaded my rails app to heroku and would like to run it with thin instead of webrick

10237219
many-to-many	one-to-many
fluent api together with code-first data annotations and conventions is a tool to define model details in code such as string length if a property is required or the type of relationship - many-to-many one-to-many etc

10237220
put	get
now it works completely fine except for some unknown reason if i put it the month of november or the month of march as the arguments i get an array of one day less

10237243
aggregate-functions	sum
use group by and the sum aggregate-functions

10237266
wordpress	expressionengine
imo the gold standard would be a wordpress equivalent to expressionengine s safecracker + devdemon s channelimages

migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade from xcode 3 to xcode 4.2 and migrate an existing ios apps to use this new versioning

10237298
hash	salt
also the auth- password function is a wrapper for security hash where the salt is always used

10237298
hash	md5
use security hash password md5 false instead

treeview	tabcontrol
i have a c# windows form application where i have a treeview inside a tabpage of a tabcontrol which is a part of the main form

10237370
leaflet	openlayers
it s not as mature as the likes of openlayers but as you ve tagged this post with android leaflet just kicks ass in the mobile department

10237376
int	double
i used a list of int to make it easier to test so every int there should be a double

10237381
hide	show
what you re trying to do is show and hide specific parts of the page when clicking on a link

10237438
ssl	https
oh and always collect users information handle logons and registrations over https ssl

10237444
hide	show
rather than messing with absolute positioning i suggest you use the css display attribute to show or hide your div

10237446
jobs	cron
from what i know about cron jobs that should run at 5pm based on my local timezone

10237446
jobs	cron
among other things it pulls in the config and attempts to schedule the upcoming cron jobs

10237469
min	rank
so the size of a b is m -by- n and rank a b is min m rank b

10237469
rank	max
if you want to search for a certain rank on b randomly you need to start off with a valid b with max rank and rotate a random column j of a random b i by a random amount

10237543
serializable	deserialization
i have yet to see any generic solution that will properly handle serializable and deserialization of any object no matter how complex if someone has one of these please post it here it would be useful to a lot of folks

10237544
getter	setter
the problem is that i have an animation timeline essentially scalar values at particular frames and the output of this needs to be piped to and from getter setter methods within the objects to be animated

10237544
getter	setter
the timeline only holds floats so whatever scalar type the object uses for it s getter setter methods must be cast i have a partial specialisation for floats that does away with the cast

10237544
getter	setter
objtype is the animated object type getter and setter are pointers-to-methods and scalar is the type getter and setter and expected to deal with

10237544
getter	setter
i thought this would be fine but compilation failed because some of the getter setter had other default-initialised arguments

10237544
getter	setter
i have also been looking at std function and std bind i was hoping to be able to store a std function as a member with the getter setter method s default args preset - and change the appropriate arg for one from the timeline just before calling

10237550
mdpi	hdpi
i put icons 72x72 in hdpi 48x48 in mdpi and 36x36 in ldpi

10237643
post	get
it s a restful api which can be called using get or post for example and the output is json which is easy to parse in pretty much every common language platform

10237668
submit	submission
when the user pressed the submit button on pagetwo.aspx the validation error occurs in our case safari was submission the value of the viewstate for the previous page pageone.aspx

10237671
hide	show
when the second indicator is show the hide method is called on the first instance

10237682
focuslistener	listeners
try looking at focuslistener and windowfocuslistener to implement the listeners for either the swing components themselves or the jframe

10237688
width	margin
i did it by just calculating how much of a margin there was between the difference of body width - image width divided by 2 for the left margin

10237704
nsstring	nsdata
this is written in obj-c and allows for aes128 encryption of nsstring and nsdata

10237736
minimum	max
considering that sub lists can have different size get the minimum size or depending on need make it max

10237777
eigenvalue	diagonal
in addition solveh_banded will crash if i have too large a dynamic range of all positive values along the main diagonal even though this should not be an actual problem i m guessing that roundoff makes the smallest values seem effectively negative so it s seen as having negative eigenvalue and there s some chance a tridiagonal-specific routine would not hit this issue

10237790
public	protected
these variables are then used directly without a protected or public getter

10237803
uninstall	upgrade
major upgrade is not an option since we dont want to uninstall thrid party system dlls

10237855
getter	setter
will just use as your getter as your setter if the scalar s are implicitly convertible to from float s i d even use and resp.

10237855
getter	setter
there could be only one function that could serve both as a getter and a setter

10237887
serializable	deserialization
how would one deserialize an object serializable based on the first version with the deserialization constructor of the second

10237896
ubuntu	linux
it works well on my windows desktop but has memory leak on the linux ubuntu

10237896
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 8g mem installed as virtual machine

10237907
getter	setter
okay below is a full activity file to demostrate this and has been tested with version 2.1...the only thing you need to change is the package name to match your project...note that this changes the variables in savedata to package from private if you want to keep them private which you probably should you need to implement setter getter but the below code should help you understand saving loading objects.

10238073
eclipse-rse	eclipse-pde	eclipse-emf	eclipse-jdt
give the command sudo apt-get install eclipse eclipse-cdt eclipse-emf eclipse-emf-examples eclipse-emf-sdk eclipse-jdt eclipse-pde eclipse-platform eclipse-platform-data eclipse-rcp eclipse-rse eclipse-xsd eclipse-xsd-sdk those are what i have after doing all these steps

10238094
subtract	add
so how would you find the shortest amount of degrees between two other degrees and then if you should go clockwise or counterclockwise add or subtract to get there

10238094
subtract	add
i would also like it to return if i should add or subtract to get to the value finish

10238119
post	get
regardless of what language you use the asp collection for form values is going to be querystring for get and form for post

this table works 100 through and through without issue on ie firefox opera and safari to my knowlege however with google-chrome it fails misserablly but only on 1 specific column of my sortable set

10238246
background-position	background-size
use background-position and background-size properties instead

10238248
put	get
given your current predicament all you can do to get it to work imediatly is put a try catch around the new fields and then default them if they are not there

10238250
children	parent
that s why the parent property of the children doesn t get set

10238259
rss	feed

in either case the command itself executes fine but it seems like debian linux isn t sending eof up the pty

10238306
post	get
i have been using google to search for a way to get rid of them but have pretty much come up empty handed on what they mean much less how to fix them since every post i found with them has a compilation error and the warnings them selves aren t addressed

10238319
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this too is fine works in firefox google-chrome opera and safari â even on the iphone â but.

google-chrome	firefox
my client has problem with website only in ie9 the page works fine in firefox and google-chrome

10238360
getter	setter
there is a definepropery method that will essentially allow you to create accessor methods getter setter on objects without the need to invoke a function call like setprop getprop

10238360

the syntax is a little weird but i ve been able to get this to work on firefox google-chrome safari and ie9

postorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder
this article seems to indicate that for bt s a single inorder preorder and postorder traversal will not uniquely identify a tree uniquely means structure and values of keys in this context

10238435
postorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder
we can uniquely reconstruct a bt with preorder + inorder and postorder + inorder

10238435
preorder	postorder
we can also use preorder + postorder if we also stipulate that the traversals keeps track of the null children of a node

10238435
postorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder
we need inorder + preorder or inorder + postorder

10238456
google-chrome	firefox
in the comments i noticed that this fiddle is not working like google-chrome in firefox because the normalized css was checked and this fiddle just works fine in both google-chrome and firefox without normalized css

i have previously asked questions about preventing users from deleting certain key files folder in their home directory by doing something like so

integer	radix
this means get the margin-left style parse it to the integer value with radix 10 multiply it by 2.5 and then return the value to the element

10238762
filtering	grouping
what is see is whenever i add a contextual filtering the query contains a line similar to where og_node.gid xx and the value there is the value of the grouping node entity id and not the gid

10238762
filtering	grouping
i have set the default value on the contextual filtering to current og grouping from context and i have set the validation criteria to validate on the content - grouping content type and node id

you could even use the same condition as you re using tho show hide the actual albums

i would like to add a fixed width say 100px-wide and the height of the text graphic to the left of the text but the right of the vertical indentation line

i tried hiding the background and showing the modal but then when i hide the modal and show the background it scrolls the page all the way back up again

you ve used the same generic parameter named for the inner class so the type e of the inner class is shadowing the e of the outer class

getter	setter
my arraycollection instance variable was created by getter setter functions

pop-up	dialog
the error will only occur when you try to interact with the sdk for example trying to execute the fb.login method will open the auth dialog pop-up which will show the following error message

set the transparent property to true set the transparentcolor property to a unique color that does not appear anywhere else in your form clfuchsia is commonly used draw your desired shape and bordering onto a tbitmap that is the same width and height as the form and has its background filled with the form s tranparentcolor and then you can draw the tbitmap onto the form s canvas in the onpaint event or alternatively put the tbitmap onto a client-align timage so you don t have to draw the form manually

this is a file like object that receives chunk of data from nginx or apache for example

10239040
width	height
my question essentially boils down to the best way to support dynamic height of uilabel s and i suppose other elements in a uitablecell and also correctly resize the label width height and cell height when rotating

10239040
width	height
autoresizing masks for the width of labels seem to be useless in this use case and in fact cause issues with the calculated height on rotation

10239040
width	height
in heightforrowatindexpath i calculate the cell height using the tableview width and the percentage i already grabbed

10239040
portrait	landscape
if your label s width isn t an equal percentage in portrait and landscape you ll need to know both percentages

10239048
hide	show
specifically i am trying to create a checklist for the user to hide or show items on the canvas when the checkbox is selected or deselected

10239083

i m trying to set the width and height of a listpopupwindow with no luck

i am not sure why you apply show and hide but this might be what you want

10239197
capitalization	uppercase
while doing that i fixed the capitalization so names aren t all uppercase and renamed a few countries to the name that is used on wikipedia so macedonia the former yugoslav republic of became macedonia for example

10239214
subobject	instances
auth_profile_module would then simply reference that single userprofile but its instances can then use the .content_object to get the specific subobject

antialiasing	transparent
in most situations it would probably be hard to tell the difference between a transparent 512px icon masked at a 90px radius and one masked at 89.825 but the antialiasing of the rounded corner would definitely end up slightly different and would likely be visible in certain circumstances especially if a second more precise mask is applied by apple in code or otherwise

uiview	subviews

10239558
submit	submission
you can either call submit to do the submission or use ajax

10239568
children	parent
notice that it could be as simple as just storing the parent if we don t need to keep the children of a node ordered

10239568
rational-numbers	fractions
the idea behind nested intervals is that there s an infinite number of rational-numbers between any two integers so you could store the new node as a fractions of its previous and next nodes

10239568
children	parent
django-mptt actually uses a mix of nested sets and adjacency lists since it also keeps a link to the parent and can use it to both query children more efficiently and to rebuild the tree in case it gets messed up by someone

submit	submission
this issue happens because the page unloads submit the form before the geolocator s done doing its thing but this way we stop the form from submission and itsworking only gets called after the geolocator has done its thing so we don t submit the form until the end of itsworking when we ve done everything we wanted to do

implements	extends
cglib provides support for proxying classes because it can dynamically generate bytecode class files meaning it can extends classes at runtime in a way that java s proxy can implements an interface at runtime

for-loop	loops
for such scenarios you cant use for-loop or any other loops since it gets executed with in seconds and the points will move in seconds so cant observe the movement

hide	show
the remaining task is to programmatically show and hide the markers infowindows on mouseover of a list of addresses which i display beside the map

10239824
floating-point	integer
apart from the value being negative the string -9.4351e+0.007 is not a valid number as the exponent part of a floating-point constant can be only an integer

10239839
children	parent
these child processes can do the work in smaller chunks in their own memory space while the parent process fires off multiple children

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works every time with firefox google-chrome safari

10239903
google-chrome	firefox
it seems this is not yet implemented in firefox but should be working on google-chrome

10239910
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all s fine in ie google-chrome firefox safari

10239925
typedef	struct
in fact on a project where we needed to write code that runs on five platforms with different compilers we made it a companywide coding standard requirement to have the forward declaration separate from the struct s typedef

10239952
mouse	keyboard
use something like ahk auto hotkey it is a simple language that can be compiled to an exe and is designed for automating the keyboard and mouse

it sounds like your multibinding doesn t know where to look for the converter

10239965
ubuntu	linux
i m using the following python code to embed a terminal window from ubuntu linux in a tkinter window

10240005
width	height
well i have made it working by getting screen height and width

10240005
width	height
if width is less than height just discarding it and if above allowing it

10240013
firefox	safari
this technically does sorta that but in firefox it triggers when you click to open and when you click to close which you can actually do in one click which produces the exact same thing in safari and firefox

10240058
hide	show
maybe even hide that textareas and show divs with actual rendered content and catch clicks on them

10240078
folder	directory
its much clearer to me on the unix side that you can pull a project into a local folder but its not at all clear how the typical directory structure of a vs project is supposed to be affected by subversion

10240094
puts	gets
what i m trying to do is to have it also log all my puts as well as my sql queries like it does in development mode except it still gets logged to log delayed_job.log

10240138
for-loop	loops
i want to automate the process -- to run a for-loop that loops through a portion of the elements in the table and outputs their fit parameters

10240158
post	get
post get is out because to my knowledge the user would have to do something to submit it and the user s not even going to see the page

10240163
restrict	shared
semaphores are used to control restrict the access to a shared resource lets say a global variable from multiple threads

10240205
google-chrome	firefox
however it only works in firefox not in google-chrome

10240206
width	height
then i use the updated label width to determine the height of my labels and add any necessary cell padding to calculate my cell height

10240210
mouse	keyboard
you can bind arbitrary events mouse keyboard window manager and possibly others to any widget in tkinter

10240236
width	height
i found that adjusting the width and height of the input element does not make the microphone larger

10240244
width	height
presumably one of the dimensions either width or height will be exactly the dimension called for in your thumbnail call

10240244
width	height
you can determine which one by comparing the ratios of thumbw width and thumbh height the smaller of the two will be used

10240244
width	height
the thumbnail dimensions are nominally width ratio and height ratio

10240284
post	put
now my thought is put the div which displays the blog post within a slider then we can display subsequent post as each div refreshes

10240285
textview	imageview
but you should change textview to an imageview and then perform zoom operations

10240285
textview	imageview
here is the link to convert textview to imageview converting a textview- bitmap- imageview and nothing #39

10240287

installation	upgrade
of this project and it will upgrade existing installation

10240474
ant	maven
based on the details you have given in the question the right direction as far as i can see to solve this kind of use scenario build multiple applications from single source base is to adopt external build tools like ant or maven dominate build process both provide the ability to fine-control on every single step compile dex package and etc

10240474
ant	maven
i am not a fun of phonegap but have a quick look through its get started guide base on my understanding it is just another programming layer stack on top of android sdk to provide ability to write mobile app by mainly using web programming language html css javascript the application still keep the original project skeleton so i would not expect much trouble to write ant maven script to build the phonegap app

10240493
integer	unsigned
the problem is that comparison between signed and unsigned values are machine dependent because they depend on the sizes of the various integer types

10240565
post	get
this does not include get or post parameters or the domain name

10240577
typedef	struct
near as i can tell this compiles with c because in c struct names and typedef names are in different namespaces but it does not compile with c++ evidently because typedef and struct names are in the same namespace

10240601
udp	tcp
i need to establish two channels between client and server first is a udp channel for data transmission and second is tcp channel for sending key and iv for aes-128 in udp channel

10240601
udp	tcp
server needs to be able to connect to multiple clients the tcp and udp socket are used in select as follows

10240601
udp	tcp
when the server receives the data in udp socket the server decrypts it using the key and iv received using tcp connection

10240601
udp	tcp
when i don t use my tcp socket in select and use it outside before select to accept connection get key iv from just one client the code for accepting connection and receiving key iv from client is exactly the same as when used inside select and in select just use udp socket to send receive data

10240638
addition	multiplication
most operators include this usual arithmetic conversions step before the actual operation addition multiplication comparison etc etc

10240638
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned

10240638
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

10240638
integer	unsigned
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

10240638
integer	unsigned
all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then

10240638
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the

10240638
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

10240675
width	height
frankly i just wish i could say autoresize height based upon the label s font and width and text but that just doesn t exist. still i agree with you that it s weird that it doesn t work better

10240675
portrait	landscape
but isn t didrotatefrominterfaceorientation too late because i m seeing my portrait uilabels flash up right after it goes to landscape but before the landscape redrawing invoked here takes place

10240804
uidatepicker	uipickerview
with built in uidatepicker you cannot do that.you will have to create uipickerview with specific dates you want

10240817
pull	push
i currently the only way to route such messages to the appropriate client is through pub sub however a i want to decide how to route at runtime by sending a routingto tag along with the message body b i want to use push pull to forward to clients not pub sub because i want to implement blocking functionality when setting the high water mark property c i want to have c1 and c2 connect on exactly 1 port for pushing and 1 port for subscribing

10240817
pull	push
after running below code push pull - pub sub and sent all messages and have received confirmation that all messages were received the client that pushed messages out still displays a huge memory footprint apparently there are still huge amounts of messages in the push socket s queue

10241275
opera	firefox
the fact is that firefox and opera do not support mp3 files in html5 audio tag

10241286

10241577
mp4	h.264
the mp4 container can also support h.264 and aac so if your input uses these formats then you can simply copy and paste the video and audio from the mp4 to the flv

10241611
superclass	subclassing
then create 2 subclassing from upper superclass

10241626
min	max
during some operation in the application min value and max value get assigned to the date field

my solution was bitmap.createscaledbitmap b1 width height true

10242017
getter	setter
excuse the lack of setter getter etc

10242045
serializable	deserialization
note it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected serialversionuid conflicts during deserialization causing deserialization to fail

10242048
width	height
the width and the height are the sizes of the square in the big picture

10242057
for-loop	loops

10242370
freebsd	linux
this is the same on osx and linux however my freebsd vm is not only much faster at running this test it also can go on for quite a ways

10242370

stdout	stderr
to summarize you need to set the robolectric.logging system property to either stdout stderr or a file path where the log should be written

10243320
int	boolean
it s easier to count fields that are filled by casting boolean to int

10243329
put	get
make sure you get the path right in case you put the files in a subdirectory

10243329
popover	tooltip
also make sure to include each file separately and place the inclusion of tooltip before popover since popover depends on tooltip to be loaded first

10243333
typedef	struct
personally i don t think that repeating struct provides any benefit and i m happy to use just the typedef name

10243333
typedef	struct
and because c++ effectively provides the typedef struct xyz xyz

10243333
typedef	struct
the c compiler is happy with it so i normally use typedef struct tag tag

folder	directory
the idea with this would be that students would be able to generate a swf file and in the same directory they would have a folder with images

10243353
folder	directory
first i thought i d try to read the directory contents - so i tried the code here as3 basics list all files in a folder including subdirectories air .

hide	show
i have the following code to hide show divs.first of all i hide them all and then i show the one relevant one

10243759
int	double
math.floor is declared to return a double and so will never return something with a static type of int

a double can hold larger numbers that an int can represent

10243765
sdl	xlib
or in another implementation using xlib i re-parented this output of sdl window to a native x11 window

10243816
disk	ram
when the data is in memory - you can do anything much faster on it since disk io is extremely slower then ram so sorting it and reading it multiple times is expected to be much slower then manipulating the data on memory

10243816
disk	ram
only one disk read - since the disk is much slower then ram -

10243845
wan	lan
wan interface is eth1 and lan interface is eth0

10243845
wan	lan
i am writing a script which will bring down lan interface eth0 if wan link or default gateway goes down if lan interface goes down then ucarp can release the nat gateway ip to another router on the network

10243845
wan	lan
also if the wan ip gets pinged then lan interface should come up and should remain up until wan ip can be pinged

10243845
wan	lan
what i want is if a wan ip can be pinged then the lan interface eth0 should remain up

you can place a border and put the graph chart control in it control the border width height margin etc with binding something like this

10248997
int	double
double values aren t precise for int values and so probably shouldn t be used for this sort of thing

10249024
lcds	graniteds
as an alternative you could consider using graniteds instead of blazeds graniteds has a much more powerful data management stack than blazeds it competes more with lcds and fully support lazy-loading for all major jpa engines hibernate eclipselink openjpa etc

10249066
sysv	systemd
the whereis can be helpful if you have executables with the same name in different parts of your path like sysv shutdown usr sbin shutdown and berkeley shutdown usr ucb shutdown on solaris systemd

10249323
profiling	debugging
your debugging signing should be done with your dev profiling and your release signing should be done with your distribution profiling

10249345
touchesmoved	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved
or you could write a uiview -subclass and overwrite touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended

10249417
multiplying	add
i rectified this by adding a decrementing variable which takes the elementcount which autoincrements every time they add a new label element and multiplying it by a set amount to decrement by

10249424
hive	hdfs
hive operates on files that are stored on hdfs

10249444
children	parent
but seriously i m an experienced developer and i understand that windows 7 pro 64-bit and the like will say oh if you move an ntfs tree from one drive to another when i write the children files that really means that i m modifying the parent folder so i ll update its timestamp. so i wind up with all the destination files having the same timestamps as the original but all of the folders having the same just-now-modified date time

10249479
mp3	wav
if you want to play a mp3 wav midi you can make some win32 api calls

10249650
width	height
i want change the width or height when i call plugin like

10249652
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop only goes to up to times.length - 2 since i is always strictly less than times.length - 1 so there is no issue about being outside the bounds of the arrays

10249660
mouse	keyboard
i can move between uitextfield s with the tab key and capture the return key through the textfieldshouldreturn method but i have a submit button on the page also and would like to cruise through it without going to the mouse by firing it from the keyboard

10249674
haskell	scheme
one last note since you re doing something similar you should look into a similar project of implementing a scheme in haskell -- iiuc it even has hygienic macros

10249681
post	put
i have a script that i put together from another post but i need the script to allow more urls.

10249705
ant	maven
there are still a lot of building compiling tools ant or maven you can check before you write your own

10249724
hide	show
if you don t need to add an unlimited number of inputs my recommendation would be to use the combination of a custom multivaluefield and multiwidget and show hide the fields you might want to initially hide

10249765
folder	directory
i have succeeded to build the distribution directory using only the kivy module.so the output folder dist default has all the necessary files i hope in order to build my apk

10249775
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
for point 3 i believe you can re-use an sqlconnection if you do sqlcommand.executenonquery but if you use an sqldatareader you cannot re-use the connection - it is tied to the sqldatareader and must be closed disposed of once finished

10249793
ssl	https
i have developed an in-house air app for the ipad that tries to connect to a jetty web server via ssl https using httpservice

10249899
listview	gridview
i would like it that as i click on a particular report in the listview the relevant parameters in the gridview get a green background and those that do not apply are red

10249904
range	minimum
i would suggest increasing the minimum amount of scramble first and then the upper range if you still do not get the desired effect

10249926
for-loop	loops
this is not python specific but you might unroll your double for-loop a bit so that the file writes to not occur on every iteration of loops

10249940
public	protected
it ll only do it to methods that are public or protected

10249945
gridview	objectdatasource
so i have objectdatasource that has an update and delete method associated with it and the ds is conntected to a gridview

10249976

however i will suggest implements the runnable interface instead of just extends the thread class

10249991
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie 8 it will change with no fade in

10250020
portrait	landscape
i ve designed a layout for landscape and portrait mode

10250031
free	malloc
if you know for a fact that all malloc free calls will be used in a lifo fashion you may be able to link in your own malloc free functions using something like the following

10250031
free	malloc
an alternative approach which could be used if the external code doesn t use malloc free in lifo order but it would be okay if blocks don t free until your code does so would be to make free do nothing but have some other function which behaves like free above

10250118
int	double
generics cannot be used with primitive types like int or double which are not objects or classes

10250145
put	get
when i put debug statement in the place where imagestore trying to get my model it prints proper module already imported and proper class name string

10250182
int	double
in case of value objects int double structs etc mr.foo has a cool mp3 track named bar

10250200
jwindow	jdialog
the only good option as i think is to determine where on the screen is system toolbar positioned and show your custom notifications based on jdialog or jwindow with alwaysontop mark in some of the corners near it

10250213
width	height
then each button needs height of 0dp this lets the weight apply and scale the button horizontally and width of fill parent

10250213
width	height
this is the best way to organise items according to a percentage width or height

10250213
width	height
as an aside if you had two buttons one with weight 2 and one with weight 1 then 1 button would be 33 of the parents height width and the other 66 of the parents height width

10250251
src	attr
attr src value

10250251
src	attr
attr src this

10250255
width	height
i used javascript pie chart and if i set fixed width or height it is working fine but if i set 100 width and height it is not displaying pie chart

10250255
width	height
i need change width and height when content have resized 100

10250295
fflush	gets
2 make a call to the fflush method every time you print this way all of the data in the internal buffer gets written out

10250337
post	get
but i am not sure how to make the haml links so that they lead to the various controller actions i need to go to on get and post

10250342
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
i am guessing here when i have gotten to a submenu by clicking an onscreen preference which is really a preferencescreen i am no longer in my own preferenceactivity

10250411
width	height
easier than doing array x + y width plus you don t have to remember whether you re supposed to be doing x + y width or x height + y

10250466
qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
i need to use qabstractitemmodel with qtreeview in pyqt

10250523
layoutparams	viewgroup
note also that the two parents must be either the same type of viewgroup or you need to change the layoutparams of the child view to the appropriate type of the new parent

10250576
bellman-ford	dijkstra
you can google for a dijkstra algorithm bellman-ford algorithm floyd and warshall.

10250602
min	rank
however we need to rank over the values of the min rec_seq per batterid group in order to use rec_seq to control the order

10250607
post	get
for methods that are not post or get the client will send an options request to determine what is allowed cross domain

10250651
google-chrome	firefox
note that you have to run it from a web server opening the html file from the filesystem will give you the blank canvas in google-chrome or just the text in firefox

10250656
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in the most recent versions of ie firefox and google-chrome

10250669
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
reproduced in firefox 11.0 google-chrome 18.0.1025.162 m safari 5.1.5 opera 11.62

10250685
stdout	stderr
that means that stdout and stderr will be redirected nowhere to keep

10250689
hash	md5
i try to set a md5 hash for the files i m uploading to azure

10250719
post	get
when i do a get i get the userprincipal request.getuserprincipal but for a post it returns null

10250726
stdout	stderr
2 represents the stderr stream and it s saying to redirect it to same place that stream 1 stdout was directed which is dev null sometimes referred to as the bit bucket

10250726
stdout	stderr
if you didn t want the output to go to dev null you could put for example a filename there and the output of stderr and stdout would go there

10250734
jobs	cron
note by default the output of cron jobs will be sent as an e-mail to the user owning the job

10250758
integer	unsigned
this number can be encoded as an unsigned 32-bit integer but not as a signed 32-bit integer

10250770
stdout	stderr
means send stderr to the same place as stdout dev null

10250784
folder	directory
i would suggest that you remove the folder in drupa.7.12 and move everything up one directory

10250784
folder	directory
move all the contents of drupal 7.12 up one directory to your public_html folder

10250826
width	height
when x is equal to width and y is less than height you will be writing to the array 0 y+1 cell

10250826
width	height
because height and width say they equal 5

10250833
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
if you know the width height of the animated element you can animate the position top bottom left right and then substract the corresponding margin

10250869
maven	pom.xml
update - looks like this is related to eclipse indigo having maven 3 and my pom.xml xml files being old maven2

10250877
cdf	exp
so the pdf is f t -l exp -lt and the cdf is f t prob t t 1 - exp -lt

10250881
int	double
whereas a complex number type can often be cast directly to a double or int though that strips information from it

10250883
put	get
if i put it in the control template triggers it works fine...but if i put it in the textbox triggers i get a build error that says

10250904
folder	directory
i ve unzipped the folder and i know i m supposed to put the 3 jar files in the lib directory of play itself or of the application i m creating or that of elasticsearch

10250905
for-loop	arrays
with a for-loop you ll have the index of the appropriate value in the placehodervalue arrays

10250911
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this parameter is required in firefox and opera but it is optional in internet explorer google-chrome and safari

10250911
google-chrome	safari
if this parameter is omitted insertrow inserts a new row at the last position in internet explorer and at the first position in google-chrome and safari

10250964
rss	feed
unless they have rss feed which you would still need to pull to see if they have changed there really isn t anyway to find out when the site has changed except by going to it and checking

10251034
mp4	h.264
see also wikipedia for the mp4 file format h.264 video compression format and other parts of mpeg4

10251069
for-loop	loops
but i have a question let s say we have a for-loop and we want to use a variable inside the body of that loops

10251100
equals	tostring
this way you generate the tostring hashcode equals readobject writeobject and possibly their builder classes as well from a single definition

10251198
interbase	firebird
we have used interbase firebird for many years and have adopted the password hashing from the interbase security database as a convenient standard for some non-critical encryption uses

10251237
jlist	jtable
i think that you have to read tutorial how to use lists especially part writing a custom cell renderer concept of renderer is the same for jlist jtable or for jcombobox too

10251263
apache	lighttpd
for practical reason i use xampp for php projects because xampp runs on both windows and linux so the only thing i need to do is a simple folder installation then a simple lighttpd apache configuration and that s it

10251290
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when i call then evaluates to true whereby parentviewcontroller is the uiviewcontroller that presented the modal view note not a uinavigationcontroller

10251317
x86	64bit
note that the x86 in windows means 32-bit or just edit your project and pick a 64bit jvm

10251349
width	margin
remember if you assign a 50 of width for one block the one to its right must have about a 48 of width because you gotta include the margin s and padding s that s why sometimes when you have a div of 1000px and you assing 500px for a child and 500px for the other child the second one is below of the first one

10251354
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
they are able to use 50 width while still specifying some horizontal padding by applying box-sizing border-box

10251387
put	get
when i call the fnreloadajax i put the get parameters in the first function argument like this

10251401
post	get
and whenever there is a query into the website database i post into the site and get the contents loaded html code into textview and webview as seen in demo app pic below

10251401
post	get
i know i can use json and php scripts to post and get results but the thing is i don t have access to the webpage or the server

10251426
apache	nginx
i would prefer this approach for web - when you just return an url and it s handled by browser and apache nginx so you don t have to worry about streaming at all

10251435
implements	extends
yes depending on what you want to achieve you can override the method ontouchevent on your class that extends view or implements a touchlistener to your object

10251505
couchbase	couchdb
the confusion you are running into is that couchbase 2.0 uses couchdb as a database back end in place of sqlite

10251529
stdout	stderr
you can use the and parameters to subprocess.call to direct stdout or stderr to a file descriptor of your choice

10251555
google-chrome	firefox
the problem occurs on firefox working fine on google-chrome and on ie

10251573
quicksort	mergesort
what i noticed was that some of the implementations used a tuned quicksort while others used a modified mergesort

10251650
folder	directory
first go to the directory where you have set up a folder to put all the files of your app from command line using dos commands

10251681
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is used for arrays of primitive types while mergesort for object arrays

10251681
quicksort	mergesort
hence quicksort is used except when sorting an array of objects for which mergesort is performed

10251722
put	get
just put your data in the text box don t write it somewhere else then try to get it back and put it where you want it

10251735
children	parent
it seems as though you have a foreign key constraint defined which enforces referential integrity and prohibits you from deleting a parent row if children exist

10251740
getter	setter
it you don t want that you ll need getter and setter for the values

10251743
put	get
however in order to provide some convenience to the user i am allowing this form to get loaded with data prepopulated - the main form will instantiate this form with the data to put into the textbox and this btnfetch_click handler will get called from the constructor

10251787
hide	show
another option is to use javascript to show hide the proper elements

10251813
for-loop	arrays
if response.d is an arrays you could place it in a for-loop like so

10251814
mouseleave	mouseenter
there is obviously a label inside it for the text and when i click on the label it obviously doesn t trigger the buttons click event or mouseenter or mouseleave

10251830
jar	war
after resolving obvious code jar path errors i then check if i can export a war file correctly

10251844
equals	gethashcode
when you override equals don t forget to override gethashcode as well - these must be overriden together

10251875
post	put
however if i put this customized control into an update panel and click on this button after post back the update panel will change the button s render to only have tag and delete tab outside the which could potentially change my css selector

10251960
post	put	post	get	put	get
currently my app can handle http requests allowing users to retrieve contact information through get requests or add edit contacts through put post requests the requests have an xml body

10251964
hash	salt
what you can do is once you have received the imei from the user you can apply an algorithm on it you can for example shuffle the string and add some salt on it and them generate a hash of it

10251992
onresume	onpause
i have also notice that onpause onstop onresume are never being called

10252030
int	double
there are a number of cases where func eval is unavailable yet people still expect to see a display for primitive types like double int etc .

10252036
onresume	onpause
the home button does not kill the application it should call onpause when hit and onresume when you come back to the app afterwards

10252045
min	max
you can use the max-height property rather than height but it won t work in ie6 which doesn t respect any min max properties

10252049
verilog	vhdl
i have a top level verilog module that instantiates a vhdl block with a few outputs that are records

10252085
post	put	post	get	put	get
to send get post put delete request the user must send his request using curl

10252201
free	malloc
11614 address 0x0 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d

10252225
strdup	malloc
the strdup function calls malloc internally and then copies the source string into the target

10252256
int	boolean
in c++ int can be treated as boolean and you got no errors at compile time

10252292
contour	imshow
in case anyone comes across this article looking for what i was looking for i took the above example and modified it to use imshow with an input stack of frames instead of generating and using contour on the fly

10252293
jruby	mri
i have read that jruby is roughly equal on speed with mri

10252302
mousehover	mouseleave
third since label s doesnt have flatappearance property you have to set it manually by hooking the mousehover and mouseleave events of the label and set the colour u want

10252302
mousehover	mouseleave
fourth you should also hook the button mousehover and mouseleave events to set the label the required color too

10252321
width	margin
if i had a set number of links this would probably be a lot easier as i could create a parent with a fixed width and use margin 0 auto

10252369
rtp	rtmp	rtp	rtsp	rtsp	rtmp
you could perform the necessary fixups here to transmute rtp rtsp into rtmp but as mentioned such effort is currently outside the development scope of your application

10252372
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest does not force you to use get post put and delete

10252432
subtract	add
one way to speed up a little bit is that when you slide the c c window you don t re-compute everything but only subtract the ones that are moving out of the window and add the ones that are moving in to the window

10252437
uiview	subviews
i had a similar problem-- a rotated uiview with several uiimageview subviews

10252437
uiview	subviews
to fix this i created a containerview that held the uiview and uiimageview s which were previously subviews of the uiview and applied to the uiview and to the uiimageview s

10252476
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox google-chrome and ie

10252511
int	boolean
for a recent project i felt the need to move away from .ini for our default settings file - so that we no longer had to convert some strings to int or boolean afterwards since parse_ini_file parses values as strings or are both string values

10252525
jar	war
how you get the jar files that you exclude from the war into the web container s classpath depends on your environment

10252544
mathml	mathjax
on mathjax the op asked for wysiwyg and i d argue that being able to quickly write out a math expression in ascii latex or mathml and have it directly interpreted by a one-line script included on a page provides as much or more immediate accessibility and feedback than a gui interface

10252589
min	max
if you are handling things at the level of mean count sum deviance min max of a population there s a variety of tools that can handle what you want

10252592
integer	radix
you have to convert it to integer using parseint string radix

10252732
post	get
i m assuming you meant to use get not post

10252748
google-chrome	firefox
this produces a origin null is not allowed by access-control-allow-origin. error and does not get a response from the server for google-chrome or firefox i don t care about ie since this is a small project for my use

10252748
google-chrome	firefox
when i try as a jsonp google-chrome firefox doesn t produce this error shows a unexpected syntax error unexpected token

10252748
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried this in google-chrome and firefox and looked at dev tools firebug for each and seen the same thing though firefox doesn t produce the origin error but that s apparently a bug with google-chrome anyway

10252758
maven	pom.xml
we usually add a task to our maven project pom.xml files so that findbugs is ran every time our code is compiled

10252778
serializable	deserialization
and then i try to read it out expecting the serializable deserialization will restore my object.

10252780
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
i browsed through the tilera instruction set and noticed it has only add subtract multiplying divide and shifts

10252795
springsource	grails
i ve been asked to theme a site for a team just a few hours they said but they re using grails with springsource tool suite

10252802
int	double
first of all try to use double instead of int since 1 3 0 using int

10252809
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie and firefox but not google-chrome or any webkit browser or safari

10252871
put	get
get an at t 3g microcell and put a packet sniffer on its ethernet connection

width	height
then in order to change the height of a view all one would have to do is create a new folder with the target min width and edit the values of layout_vals.xml and leave all the extraneous junk about width gravity background etc alone leaving for a much cleaner setup and easier editing

10253035
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
in any case nearly all special functions break down into basic operations add subtract multiplying divide so as long as you provide those you can implement anything

10253102
int	double
you do the arithmetic in int and then convert to double

10253102
int	double
that is you do the division round to the nearest int and then convert to double

10253124

10253164
vb.net	vb6
the result that you get is not really good whatever tool you use because vb.net code is quite different from vb6 code despite the syntax similarities

10253204
folder	directory
if you add the following before the doxygen call anything created in the directory will inherit the group of the parent folder which is essentially what you want

10253257
google-chrome	firefox
it constantly generates the error on google-chrome firefox etc.

10253261
vb.net	vb6
if your vb6 project is well structured and well commented and you are an expert in both languages vb6 and vb.net you can give it a try otherwise the conversion could become a nightmare

10253362
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing property in css3 for content-box and border-box padding-box was originally a mozilla proposal so it doesn t exist in ie

draggable	droppable
the options can be dragged into the input fields but there can t be two draggable into one droppable

prepare	execute
build your queries as a string and either execute immediate them for update insert or ddl s or use prepare open fetch for select s

10253624
japplet	jdialog
you probably shouldn t do this but rather if you want to open another window from the japplet create and show a jdialog

10253653
button	checkbox
obviously you could copy android s resources over to your local project and use those to reset the checkbox s button but that would mean you would have to take into account all the different styles from themes let alone any changes device manufacturers might make to those resources

10253672
ssl	https
from there there are many different ways to switch to https using your ssl cert

10253672

10253677
codeigniter	yii
once you have good or atleast basic knowledge of php then you should learn some mvc framwork like codeigniter or yii e.t.c

10253713
ubuntu	linux
recently i have got a small c++ soap client project ubuntu linux to build using gsoap

10253762
super	implements
if your super class doesn t implements equals then calling super.equals will get you the object implementation which only compares references so in any normal equals implementation where you want to compare a business key it would actually cause a lot of false negatives

10253788
folder	directory
now i can t find any xcode directory at this point neither i can t found xcode.app in applications folder

10253793
gif	png
if you want to check to see if its an image url and react accordingly you can use a regular expression in your onchange event of the text area to see if it contains a gif jpg or png

10253816
superclass	subclassing
in your example the use of super.equals is probably correct as long as the superclass doesn t provide a definition of equality which is counter to the one your subclassing wants as object does for instance

10253817
nssortdescriptor	nspredicate
creating the nsfetchrequest nssortdescriptor and nspredicate inside the performblock doesn t fix the problem either

you d probably want to put the javascript function into a object or other construct to get it out of the global namespace and take the event binding out of the markup if possible but i ll leave those as homework problems

10254117
reshape	rep
pdl doesn t have seq and rep specifically but it does have constructors and the ability to manipulate and reshape multi-dimensional data

10254130
hash	salt
the first one hash the password given on signup form with a dynamic salt and the second validates the password

10254130
hash	salt
i m not sure what s wrong but it seems i m splitting the hash and dynamic salt in the correct place because when i echo out it shows the first 128 chars sha512 then the dynamic salt 23 chars but when echoing out the two 128 chars hash they do not match by this i mean they are completely different hash

10254138
client-side	server-side
perhaps the best way to do this is to generate a key on the server-side pass that to the client-side code that contains the ajax call then make ajax send it back to the server and verify that it is a valid key

10254171
many-to-many	one-to-many
it will be a many-to-many relationship between user and product and one-to-many relationship between frequenceofuse and userproduct the latter being a relationship itself

10254181
express	node.js
there are so many template engines for node.js and express and there is even this detailed comparison this led me to check out ejs mu2 and jqtpl and i spent some hours on experimenting which of them fits my needs best

10254207
scatter	graphing
i am graphing the data directly using scatter and then plotting a fit line least squares from scipy using plot

10254243

10254358
post	get
how can i use query to get the full list of emails and post it as follows to rails

10254360
put	get
your if xhr is effectively doing this - a browser won t normally send that header if the address is put in the address bar but a user can easily get the same effect outside of your ajax code

10254368
dictionary	map
then use a dictionary for to map the 1-many relationship of colors-values

10254446
superclass	subclassing
of course if these different classes have lots of common methods and properties you can create both as subclassing to a common superclass

10254463
firefox	safari
if you want to use firefox but tell my server your using safari or ie and get a crappy looking page why is it my problem

10254483

10254547
pull	push
i believe my problem is that .project files are being overwritten at each push pull when switching between machines

10254547
pull	push
this causes a constant loop of deleting the project adding the project conf git pull dev push

10254547
pull	push
example i dev on desktop push to repo my server pull down to laptop aptana kicks an error stating that the project file is corrupt and cannot be opened

10254550

plus you defined the request type as get but reading them as post too

10254558

10254607
integer	unsigned
â 2 the typedef name uint n _t designates an unsigned integer type with width n

10254607
integer	unsigned
uint24_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 24 bits

10254615
post	get
i ve changed type from get to post - you are accessing the php _post global in your script so the php would have been looking in the wrong place for variables

10254653
int	chars
chars c1 is an eight-bit signed int type which is set to 0b11111111

10254653

thus from portrait rotation in the details fragment to landscape and back again the view remains and is shown correctly

10254763
cos	sin
cgaffinetransformmakerotation is explicitly defined to return a matrix with cos angle in the transform s a value sin angle in b etc and given the way the transform works that s the only thing it really could do

10254781
cassini	iis
what i would suggest is to make sure you are using visual studio 2010 sp1 then install iis express which is an upgrade to cassini and is much more like real iis and then switch your project to use iis express and see if you get the same exception

10254801
post	get
i guess by default it taking it a get request but your ajax is a post request

10254810

this software allows you to create a disk partition right out of your ram

10254814
qmenubar	qstatusbar
qdockwidgets a qmenubar and a qstatusbar

10254814
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
probably the easiest solution is setting the minimumsize for the widget inside qdockwidget so that the layout manager in qmainwindow will not shrink it beyond that

10254831
setinterval	settimeout
combined with the settimeout or setinterval function you could easily achieve your goal

10254844
onclick	onsubmit
you can try changing the onsubmit or onclick function that is running the ajax request to return false and i think that should fix it

10254845
versioning	upgrade
perhaps that issue is fixed in versioning 6 but i m not willing to upgrade right now

10254872
folder	directory
one solution would be to include the splitted database in the assets folder and copy it to the database directory on the first startup

10254872
folder	directory
but this would consume disk space twice - one time in the assets folder where the file can t be deleted and one time in the database directory where it has been copied to

10254880
udp	tcp
well there s not much between tcp udp if you ignore the connect disconnect latency

10254885
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
you can call qgraphicsitem group on the qgraphicsitem returned by qgraphicsscene itemat

10254888

sample format unsigned integer

10254895
hide	show
my initial thinking was to use slidetoggle hide show but i can t seem to get that to work

10254895
hide	show
i have searched on stackoverflow and seem to find a lot of questions regarding showing and hiding an entire div but the problem is this completely show and hide the divs

10254896
folder	directory
one solution would be to include the splitted database in the assets folder and copy it to the database directory on the first startup

10254921
subtraction	addition
if you never need to do any time to time calculations addition subtraction etc based on when the like occurred than the age of the person is completely valid basically you re pre-evaluating birthdate-likedate

10255115
many-to-many	many-to-one
prefetch_related is only needed when you want to avoid an o n query issue with many-to-many or many-to-one relationships that is with a manytomanyfield or a reverse traversal of foreignkey

10255133
innodb	myisam
the fact that the join to the icons table has no entry for possible_keys leads me to believe you are running a myisam storage engine or an innodb storage engine with no fk constraints

10255169
nsurl	nsstring
use the nsurl method absolutestring to get the path and then use nsstring methods pathextension stringbydeletingpathextension and finally lastpathcomponent to get the extension and name

google-chrome	firefox
the browser opens and shows a blank page in all the three google-chrome firefox ie

10255384
width	height
i am now trying to get the width and height with action script so i can load another movieclip into it and make it the same size

10255384
width	height
however when i do the following code i can t position it correctly because the scale is width and height displays the original size and not showing the scaled size cordinates

10255384
width	height
so when i place the new clip inside of it the i can t make it be the same width and height as the rescaled clip

10255438
hash	md5
there are bugs in the azure code in xe2 you should be aware of this link also shows how to create and format the md5 hash value

10255449

when you try to #idimgperson attr src data

10255452

this example will add the image the first time the user hovers caching it then it will show hide the image every hover after that

10255473
udp	tcp
-p tcp udp protocoll tcp or udp

10255473
udp	tcp
after this rules you need to make a rule to drop all requests to tcp udp connections to port 3306

10255477
udp	tcp
kademlia s designers do not appear to have taken into consideration the use of ipv6 addresses or tcp ip instead of udp or the possibility of a kademlia node having multiple ip addresses

lwjgl	slick2d
my problem is with slick2d and i m having difficulty working with the lwjgl origin 0 0 being in the top left v.s

what about using the php fwrite function to write the quiz data to file s then recalling the data on your results.php page s with the fopen and or related functions feof fgets fgetcsv etc

10255574
textarea	textbox
the idea is that a user is presented with say 50 tags inside a textarea but instead of just selecting a tag word and removing it there is an x alongside that removes the tag from the list and there is a textbox where a new word can be added

10255656
gridview	sqldatasource
edit it does appear that if you use autogeneratecolumns true on the gridview and populate via sqldatasource it will automatically bind the values of the controls by name to the appropriate parameters in the sql query without any extra code

10255663
fputs	fflush
if both fputs ack and fflush are commented out everything does work as intended

10255669
for-loop	if-statement
i made it work by setting and then running an if-statement in the for-loop to change the value as a string

10255693
google-chrome	firefox
i m using bouncycastle to generate a ca certificate and a http-suitable certificate and i ve noticed that sslstream will not accept any certificate signature algorithms that are not md5withrsa and this means that google-chrome and firefox will simply refuse to open pages because it expects sha1withrsa for it s signature algorithm

10255701
width	height
as jin35 said your problem was that the view s width and height haven t been calculated yet...the dimensions aren t calculated until after the layout pass

10255701
width	height
using a fixed width and height from dimension resources from a values dimens.xml file is one workaround since then you don t need to wait for the view s onmeasure to occur -- you can get the value of the same dimension resource you used for the view you re interested in and use that

10255702
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
opera mini doesn t work with my site - so unfortunately this otherwise perfect example from opera doesn t work but any of the current versions of the big 5 ie google-chrome firefox opera safari would work with my site flawlessly.

10255714
children	parent
in the flexbox layout model the children of a flexbox can be laid out in any direction and can flex their sizes either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent

10255756
width	height
flexible sizing the size of the boxes can be computed as the explicit size using height width max-height max-width... or the size of the parent box and available space with box-flex

10255765
int	double
it s probably because you are wrapping the query in double quotes but the variable is in single quotes so it s being treated as a literal and if the column is int you will get a 0 instead

10255783
google-chrome	firefox
i can not reproduce the problem in neither firefox nor google-chrome

10255805
width	height
you must explicitly set width and height

10255807
hide	show
and in my activity i just set setlayoutchangelistener for myrelativelayout to hide bottombar when softkeyboard show up and display bottombar when softkeyboard hide

10255840
width	height
textview 2dp in height and width match parent and set the background color as the color you want the line to be

10255880
hash	md5
even the standard md5 hash is considered broken now and shouldn t be used on its own without salting it and perhaps using other hashing combinations in tandem with it

10255889
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
one simple but good example is using md5 hash + salt md5 password + random_string - no matter php or mysql you use - result is the same

10255889
hash	salt
find something with random salt so every password can have almost unlimited amount of hash make few changes combine it with other hashing algorithm - problem solved

10255892
outputstream	inputstream
if it is a binary file use the inputstream | outputstream and derived classes when text use reader | writer and derived classes

10255892
hex	binary
do not use the readers and writers to download a binary file like i did this only works for the text and then you have to use hex string that adds to performance problems

10255893
shadowing	named
what s happening is that inside foo you create a copy of b and assigns it to a shadowing the empty dict you sent as an argument by reassigning a new object to the same named

10255938
hide	show
currently i have assigned a link i.e with id #link20111 for each of these divs div with id #20111 that when clicked hide the children of #bottomrightbox div and show the specific div

10255938
hide	show
so my code as seen below simple responds to the onclick function of each link and then hide all the divs within the parent div and show the specific div that is assigned to it by name

10255938
hide	show
link with id #link20111 - click - hide children of #bottomrightbox - show div with id #20111

10255938
hide	show
link with id #link20112 - click - hide children of #bottomrightbox - show div with id #20112

10255938
hide	show
link with id #link20113 - click - hide children of #bottomrightbox - show div with id #20113

10255944
hash	salt
that said for passwords you are probably better off with using a strong hash sha1 alongside a salt for storing passwords

10255964
qtcpsocket	qiodevice
certain subclasses of qiodevice such as qtcpsocket and qprocess are asynchronous

10256004
children	parent
all the rules are generic although they can refer to different rows via parent children relations etc so some form of recursion is required

10256020
jar	war
build path or not you need to make sure that the primefaces jar file ultimately ends up in web-inf lib folder of the built and deployed war file

10256020
jar	war
if you really insist to keep the jar elsewhere and manually manage the build path for some reason then you d need to manually add it in the deployment assembly section of the project s properties as well to get it to ultimately end up in the web-inf lib folder of the war

put	get
if user confirms that location then put it onto geocoding and get the location address it will surely return an address maybe exact or nearby and if user likes it user will confirm it simple

10256041
width	height
i recently switched from using an opengl viewport of 0 width 0 height instead of -1 1 -1 1 so i can get away with converting all my drawing calculations buffers to ints instead of floats if it is desirable for performance

10256041
width	height
a related question is whether i would loose any smoothness in my rendering by doing this rounding if my viewport is from 0 to width and 0 to height in pixels

10256045
put	get
if i get a chance i ll put in a pull request for the next release

hash	md5
the md5 hash used by the simple hash-based token is not a vulnerability of that approach

10256160
hash	md5
using md5 to hash passwords is dangerous because given the hash value of an existing password you can find another password that hash to the same value using a rainbow table

10256160
hash	md5
however in this case md5 is not being used to hash passwords but is being used as a mac

i highly recommend either stepping through your code in a debugger or if you re not sure how to do that at least put in a bunch of cout statements in your set function so you can check that the variables are getting set to what you think they should get set to

10256418
put	get
my second thought is that i could only put the user id as hidden field in the edit.jsp and when the form is submitted i could use to get the corresponding user object and set the fields school or address to those newly entered ones by something like user.setschool command.getschool

10256449
lessphp	less.js
don t know if you re using less.js or lessphp like in wp-less plugin for wordpress but with lessphp you can unquote strings with

traceroute	packets	icmp	udp
note - the below code works however this is a udp traceroute sends a udp packets and receives an icmp one and i need my program to send an icmp packets and receive an icmp packets

10256560
icmp	udp
this is because these days firewalls are smarter than they used to be and don t always send an icmp response after receiving a udp packet for a random port

10256560
icmp	udp
essentially the udp socket needs to be changed for an icmp one

10256565
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i suggest you to use uinavigationcontroller for this because for your purpose this can be done with uinavigationcontroller instead of uitabbarcontroller

10256589

the keydown keyup and keypress events are supported by all browsers but there are some interoperability problems because the values of the keycode property of the event object have never been standardized

10256612

10257059
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
to improve your algorithm precompute the exponents of magic_exp and use them to roll your hash - basically just as with polynoms you need to subtract the highest degree multiplying by magic_exp and add the hash of the symbol to the right for moving the hash to the right

10257069
ubuntu	linux
i am under ubuntu linux and i have already installed sqlite3 from shell

portrait	landscape
and if your requirement is that inspite of phone is in portrait landscape mode and you require an single oreintation then you can lock it through code as follow in oncreate method

10257702
prepare	execute
this is because prepare statements prepare the sql query first to find an efficient query plan and send the actual values that presumably come in from a form later - at that time the query is actually execute

i did check __cpuid from windows.h library but the problem is that the id it gets it s the id of all types of cpu if you have an i3 core processors and i have an i3 core processors it will give the same unique id

10258662
cpu	processors
here is what i came up with to make a cpu id from the __cpuid that returns the same information on processors of the same type

10258666
vmware	virtualbox

all of the mocking frameworks mentioned here are fairly good bets my personal favourite is moq and i like to use it with mspec machine.specifications but of course each developer or team needs to make those choices for themselves

10258722
jruby	mri
that s a mri specific api - there s not an api equivalent for jruby probably due the way the jvm works there are multiple gc strategies with most vms and there s no consistent api to work with the gc even a system.gc call does not necessary trigger garbage-collection immediately

10258730

i am trying to retrieve data from an rss feed

10261708

10261772
mouse	keyboard
it switches from vim to a matlab window and then you paste with the mouse or the keyboard shortcut

10261788

the variable json is already an object but it is not an arrays so a typical for-loop is insufficient

i put the mouseclicked event in resizerectangle but there it also wont get fired

10261913
put	get
i put the mousereleased event in icongrid and that does get fired

10261946
free	malloc
that said each thread is allocated its own stack within this space so auto-vars are ok if not misused and malloc free should be thread-safe so a dynamically-allocated hash map pointed to by an auto-pointer on the thread stack should be fine

10261946
free	malloc
if it s solving the problem then you re right - something malloc free maybe is not thread-safe when it should be

10261979
ssl	https
it will not work with ssl https since the traffic is encrypted

10262028
textarea	textbox
when there is no text given to a textarea and you get the textarea.value you get a single space instead of the empty string like a normal input textbox

10262028
textarea	textbox
i would prefer to work with the prototype of textarea because i am using a general procedure to get the values of both input textbox and textarea s

10262056
folder	directory
the output is created in the directory named runtime with 2 folder one for local mode and other one for cluster mode

10262061
int	chars
use an int bit array leaves you lots of space to expand and there is no advantage to a single chars and test with mask constants

10262066
jobs	cron
i don t know a lot about cron jobs

10262093
client-side	server-side
user should make some work client-side and i should check results of that work server-side and increment views only if user did it right

to allow code compiled w native extensions to run on the simulator we had to put code that used native extensions in methods that would never get executed when on the simulator

10262162
erd	entity-relationship	erd	diagram	entity-relationship	diagram
the reason your textbook may have said that you could skip the likes table in an entity-relationship diagram is that in a conceptual or logical erd many-to-many relationships can be represented by a line instead of a box assuming your erd notation uses lines for relationships and boxes for tables

the last loops in your for-loop runs

10262420
pascal	delphi
i m new to delphi and pascal in general so may be i just overlooked something obvious

10262435
flip	slide
it seems to have something to do with the type of page transition specified fade or slide or flip etc

10262445

so it is more convinient to put it in a single cell in post array that do subarray

10262565
distance	pdist
i am aware of the pdist x distance in matlab to take an nxd matrix of points and calculate the pairwise distance between them

10262638

i know i can use openssl ssl sslsocket on the client-side but i have no idea what to do on the server-side

10262676
post	get
if you know how to do this in a language other than ruby just post the code and i ll translate it i ve been working on this for about 8 hours and i need everything i can get

10262685
bash	zsh
the difference between bourne bash ksh zsh would be in the shell wildcards patterns that each shell has as an extension to the basic patterns the bourne shell supported

10262722
children	parent
it sounds like what i m really after is a parent build that has two children - the 32 and 64 bit build

10262730
google-chrome	firefox
the described behavior is in google-chrome and firefox on win7

10262736
google-chrome	firefox
each post has a 20 width it looks ok in google-chrome but in ie and firefox the last column gets pushed below so there are only 4

10262737
unix	bsd
you can either use whatever sockets api your operating system provides typically a c api on unix operating systems it would be the bsd sockets api or you can use a c++ library like boost.asio which is cross-platform

10262793
stdout	stderr
example 10 in stdout twice another 50 in stdout once rest 40 in stderr

10262793
stdout	stderr
note redirect stdout to one file and stderr to other file .

10262822
mousemove	mousedown
but instead of mousedown i would like to create a custom event called mousedrag which would be a combination of mousedown and mousemove

10262871
implements	extends
in your custom adapter your probably extends arrayadapter implements the getcount method and return the list of conferences size

10262885
crypt	salt
the php docs for the crypt function do provide some information on how to use the salt string to specify which algorithm to use

10262885
hash	salt
crypt_std_des - standard des-based hash with a two character salt

10262885
crypt	salt
using invalid characters in the salt will cause crypt

10262885
salt	md5
crypt_md5 - md5 hashing with a twelve character salt

10262885
crypt	salt
the salt will cause crypt to return a zero-length string

10262885
hash	salt
crypt_sha256 - sha-256 hash with a sixteen character salt prefixed

10262885
hash	md5
it will automatically use the best algorithm on the system unless you specify that you want a hash that is compatible with multiple systems in which case i think it uses md5

10262913
int	double
i m working on an assignment and i m getting stuck on one part of it the output of int and double to a binary file

10262913
int	double	int	chars
when i m outputting a regular string i can just typecast it using chars or use the .c_str function however i m having trouble with the double and int

10262935
zipalign	jarsigner
even if somehow php had a fully-functioning jarsigner embedded in it it is unlikely to also have zipalign

10262935
zipalign	jarsigner
note though that by sdk tools you only really need the java sdk for jarsigner and the zipalign binary which afaik has no other dependencies

10262949
profiling	debugging
i ve used the profiling in chrome s debugging tools for this purpose before

10262961
for-loop	loops
i know that python lists can be tricky to modify in a for-loop and i tried changing my code to loops over but that didn t solve my problem

10262991
sorting	filtering
if you ll change numbers of rows or colums or filtering sorting then you have to notified jpanel for rezize jtable#getpreferredscrollableviewportsize + dimension for ontop jtable only with tableheader

10263004
for-loop	loops
your solution is to not re-declare j in loops but rather declare it once as a long before loops or once as an int in the for-loop initial condition as you re doing

10263015
mouseover	mouseout
this means that whenever any image is receives a mouseover or mouseout event the opacity will always change for the last image in your list of images

10263019
content-disposition	content-type
after playing with headers in php i find that removing content-type and content-disposition seems to have an impact but i m just messing around and can t really understand what s wrong

10263026
min	max
at each new step of an iteration i want to efficiently be able to find the min or max value so i want the data structure to be sorted at all times and upon the request to insert a new element the oldest element be automatically or at least able to be efficiently popped discarded

10263026
queue	fifo
so i guess i am looking for some sort of of fifo priority queue

10263036
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am working on a personal html 5 css3 project that takes the old 1970 s super hero read-along book and records and plays them in a compatible browser safari google-chrome firefox

10263089
hide	show
ajax refresh causes show hide of some components

10263091
google-chrome	firefox
i have a php script that uses implicit_flush to output data when it s ready the problem is that when i start two instances from google-chrome or firefox the seconde instance remains loading without outputing anything

10263112
portrait	landscape
the idea is when the user change the orientation for the tablet landscape to portrait and should change the orientation for this element

10263118
getter	setter
well it breaks encapsulation you should really have public getter and setter for the data you want to expose allowing access like you suggested allows the caller to corrupt reassign etc

10263127
portrait	landscape
i almost done but i need to insert new user-control in portrait view as a child element of landscape root page

10263127
portrait	landscape
when i change supportedorientation to portrailorlandscape in rootpage and toggle orientation in emulator to portrait then every child element that was in landscape is cutted

10263134
width	height
i want to have an imageview with width fill_parent and the height should be whatever the width is

10263134
width	height
i m not sure if the above is even correct not sure if the width measurement even takes place before the height measurement for example

10263191
udp	tcp
the wcf just implements some concrete protocols over the tcp so if you need something else like ip or even udp you still need to use the sockets

10263264
post	get
i can t tell but know one thing for sure when i use the name and not submit go for the get the post i get error saying undefined index name whats up with that i did what you said but nothing

10263279
sorting	grouping
please take a look the code does work as it should set grouping happened fine and the sorting as well

10263300
children	parent
to give a new example say you have a ranking system which will ensure that objects of a particular class parent are created before other classes that are dependent on it children you may have some children who are in the same tier and it does not matter which one is created first

10263318
min	max
put each element x in bucket number floor x - min x n - 1 max x - min x

10263318
min	max
the width of each bucket is max x - min x n - 1 and the maximum adjacent difference is at least that much so the numbers in question wind up in different buckets

10263318
min	max
now all we have to do is consider the pairs where one is the max in bucket i and the other is the min in bucket j where i j and all buckets k in i j are empty

10263318
min	max
max x - min x length x - 1

10263338
width	margin
just add the content of the menu into another div with width 500px margin auto

10263349
width	height
if you want to implement this for the menu you will have to make the menu fixed height everthing else and its width can still be fluid due to the type of opacity you use in the layer

10263352
width	height
however i need to know the height and width of the grid in my viewmodel

10263358
jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	geronimo
in an ejb3 container such as geronimo jboss glassfish etc

10263389
width	height
but my question is should i use one image say the medium size and stretch it for the alrge screen by putting min width min height and fitscalexy

10263389
width	height
i was thinking of specifying width and height for each screen layout size instead of wrap content

10263405
put	get
you can only get words that you have put in

10263413
abstract-class	superclass
superclass interface or abstract-class or simpleclass

10263416
getter	setter
maybe i misunderstood when and why to use the properties vs instance variables but outside of init methods and such i was under the impression it was better to use the setter getter

10263455
google-chrome	firefox
there is only some beta development happening for google-chrome and firefox that will be publicly available not really soon

10263464
hash	salt
i have a datacontract and in my service i am trying to hash salt the password datamember

10263473
client-side	server-side
you could use a javascript implementation of rsa to encrypt the password client-side and then php on the server-side to decrypt it

10263515
google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox google-chrome but ie9 and 8 so my qa tells me randomly pop a windows security login dialog asking you to log into the remote server

10263553
width	height
this is the same text centered roughly using the width and height of the text

10263584
range	min
because in the range min input min input +m 2 there are at most m unique elements and you can handle that

10263584
range	min
2nd run only operate on elements with value in range min input +m 2 min input +m 4 and

10263593
width	margin
add a left margin to the center one whatever the width of the left div is

10263603
ienumerable	ienumerator
you have to cast explicitly to ienumerable to use the overload that returns ienumerator which may be where your problem lies

10263632
getter	setter
i read several articles informing that entity beans in a java ee environment are considered as anemic means only containing getter and setter without implementing behaviour

10263632
stateless	stateful
so that session beans stateless or stateful could delegate all business logics to them for logic making sense to be owned by entities

10263642
mp3	wav
but you should compress the wav file to mp3

10263654
prepare	execute
furthermore you should not only prepare your statement but execute it as well

10263670
fasta	biopython
i m assuming you have parsed your chromosome fasta file and have the sequences of all the chromosomes as a chrom_sequences name seq dictionary and also that you have a reverse_complement function both of those things are easily implemented by hand but probably better done with biopython

when the bytecode is interperted it is executed through the jvm interpreter not directly on the processors when it is compiled it is compiled to native machine language and executed directly on the cpu

10263822
maven	pom.xml

10263871
int	chars
i am using the python c api and would like a c function to take a python long int argument npylong and convert it to a chars array nstring in base 10

10263871
int	chars
the api reference mentions a function which converts a c chars array to a python long int given an arbitrary base but i cannot find a function which does the inverse

10263871
int	chars
one idea is to convert the python long int to a python string object and then convert to a c chars array but there are no string functions to handle long int either

10263893
equals	gethashcode
if you want that behaviour you must either use a value type a struct instead of a class a custom comparer as you have done or you must override the equals and gethashcode methods of keyclass

10263926

int	boolean
it is part of the language specification so any python implementation should implement the boolean as equivalent to the int

10265045
post	get
here are 2 examples of how to stop process.php from running both using a combination of a set session and a check on if the request is a post others have mentioned just checking submit is set but a bot would only need add that value to its params but by using a random key the bot would have to visit the form page and get the key at least once also for some extra security you could unset the session variable so process.php will only run once per form view this would slow down but not stop a brute force or spammer

10267644
realloc	malloc
the problem that valgrind reports i won t touch on the other ones is the use of malloc and realloc

10267652

there s nothing wrong to use the md5 hash of the select query because you don t need any other information to uniquely identify the result set

10268375

10268399
width	height
for testing purpose i changed the width and height value to 30 in the html code and tried

10268448

i need to figure out the width and height in pixels of a string when using drawstring to paint it on a jpanel

10273600
width	height
right now your iframe is getting cut off yes but not due to you setting overflow scroll nor due to you setting a width height property of the container frame

10273600
width	height
to prove this add a background #ff0000 to your container div and you will see that it truly is not the div s width height that is defining the cutoff region of your iframe but rather some default iframe dimension properties

10273600
width	height
my recommendation is given you said your div is of fixed dimensions set up your iframe with width height properties of those same dimensions so that it matches

10273600
width	height
you can either do this using the width and height attributes or more cleanly using css justas you have done for the container div

10273600
width	height
once you give the iframe the correct width height the cutoff should match what you expect and the browser shouldn t scroll to the size of the contents of the iframe but rather to your specified dimensions

10286309
jquery	simplemodal
you can use jquery plugin simplemodal

10286309
width	height
the only problem with that approach is that the modal s overlay appear with iframe s size so you must give it your desired width and height after you open it

i tried doing a programmatic post using webclient.uploadvalues and i get back from that a string which i can present to the user by returning content - but then the links inside that form which are supposed to be relative to the cc processing site are instead interpreted as relative to my site which is no bleedin use to me

10286433
post	get
firstly if you want to get a blog post with all the comments in it you can just do something like

10286433

10286517
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome one shows two 45 degree gray vertical stripes whereas in firefox the one bleeds over the whole image rather than being a second vertical stripe

10286532
portrait	landscape
every device i m familiar with has a distinctive portrait vs landscape mode

10286532
portrait	landscape
it would probably be wise to make sure your code can always gracefully handle portrait vs landscape - even if you ever happen to run across a square device

10286543
udp	tcp
even if done this you will also need to write a service that listens on that port using udp all of web-servers works with tcp as this is default and specified in rfc

10286574
httpconnection	downloading
however attempting a downloading through java using a url or httpconnection returns a plain html page

we found that we could really easily share our changes by just sharing our repo folder through windows using our active directory accounts right click on folder share with specific people however i d like to completely block out the possibility of having someone to push to a repository

10286684
nunit	mstest
instead try using the expectedexception attribute the attribute is the same for nunit and mstest and set the type to the exception you are expecting

10286688

drive	createfile
below is my c++ code it is suppose to locate a connected usb drive create a handle using createfile and write a raw image .img to the device

10286780
post	put
anyway the issue is that odata services need the method that addresses the edit operation delete put merge to be sent as a custom request header on a normal post rather than it being an http method

10286811
submit	submission
but at the time of submission it should actually submit the key

10286840
entity-relationship	diagram
i m working on a group project and my partner sent me a .mwb file so i could take a look at what they did for the entity-relationship diagram but she can t figure out how to send a .sql file for the database itself at least i think those are .sql files

10286871

anyways how do i perform a http post with a uiwebview so that i can update the view when needed for a different flyer to put put there etc

10286877
folder	directory
i m trying to create a branch spec that only pulls down specific folder from a repository but preserves the directory structure

10286877
folder	directory
what i m trying to do is create a branch for each project that pulls down all folder except in the 1.0 project sub directory it should only pull down the project folder specific to that folder

10286877
folder	directory
i ve tried creating a seperate codeline with a client view mapping every directory under project and beign sure to only map the project specific folder but it didn t work and i d really like to avoid having to create a new codeline for every project

vertica s variant of sql is the same as postgresql

10286915
hide	show
you can show and hide the dock icon of an application with nsrunningapplication+dockicon but beware this code uses undocumented apis

10286920
aiff	caf
since you cannot play the caf files by clicking it i suggest to have a try to convert it to other formats like wave or aiff

10286920
aiff	caf
i usually use caf for sound effects and use aiff for background music

10286938
uiview	subviews
however i tried adding an uiview with a button inside all in the uiscrollview and the button receives the touch event just fine so the problem is only with programmatically added subviews

10286952
put	get
in this cases either you put several asserts on one test knowing fully well about the cons of that approach or you can extract the arrange and act sections of the test in a method and create several tests that call upon that method get the result and assert on the specific piece of data

10286976
geocoding	geocode
the completion handler is run after the geocode has finished geocoding

10287092

you use communicate when you want to give some input to a process and read all output on stdout stderr of the process at the same time

10287097
ubuntu	linux
os linux ubuntu 11.10 oneiric x86_64

10287110
folder	directory
mac applications usually store their image files in the application bundle s resources folder but the mac version of sdl sets the working directory to a different location

10287110
folder	directory
the solution is to change the working directory to your application bundle s resources folder

10287159
min	max
center of the bounding box of all the points - you do this by finding the min and max points which are then then corners of the box

10287159
min	max
the center of this box is then min + max 2

10287175
uilabel	uibutton
right now all i can think of is breaking each word into a token and displaying positioning it differently uilabel uibutton etc however this is terribly inefficient

10287215
maven	pom.xml
in my opinion nothing should be put into the dependencies section in the parent pom.xml and seeing the warning it seems maven feels the same

10287246
facebook	fbconnect
i am trying to implement facebook into my application however whenever i go into header search paths and drag and drop my src file i still get an error for fbconnect fbconnect.h

10287276
post	get
i guess info from the previous question you want to get the item price data using ajax based on the selected item in the dropdown and send that to your action method as part of the normal form post

10287317
width	height
for instance i have a control with a height and width and i want to display the height and width on the control as a formatted string height x width

10287317
width	height
then i bind to content of my label to the displaystring property which seems a lot more convenient than using a imultivalueconverter to convert from the width and height properties

10287317
width	height
the inconvenient part is that anywhere i need to notifypropertychanged for width or height i also have to remember to notify for displaystring

10287329
google-chrome	firefox
the table sorts perfectly with firefox google-chrome ie 8 but i have a strange behaviour with ie 9 alone

10287338
sorting	filtering
one can use the option forceclientsorting true to force sorting and filtering of data on the client side before the current page of data will be displayed in jqgrid

10287356
folder	directory
newer versions of intellij uses directory based project settings in the .idea folder since like intellij 9 i think

10287450
put	get
to get around it you could use a text area where you put the value in between the tags

10287468
int	double
this will use floating point arithmetic because of the 10.0 instead of 10 and store the result in a double which has precision past the decimal point unlike an int

10287473
int	double
you could divide by 10.0 or change int percent to double percent in order to force a conversion to double

10287510
int	double
1 could be interpreted as int int float or double but none of these except int belong to the bounded class

10287515
multiplying	division
if you really need the result to be an int you could do the multiplying before the divide to avoid the integer division giving you zero

10287529
textarea	textbox
i have forms with about 100 input fields each textbox textarea radio checkbox file etc

10287529
textarea	textbox
but in textbox textarea input types the change event only occur when elements loses focus

10287567
width	height
the most straight forward answer is to get the width and height of the web view

10287567
width	height
bounds should be a cgrect and by getting half of the width and half of the height you can get the exact center of the view

10287586
width	height
you need to set either the width or height to 0dp depending on whether the linearlayout is horizontal orientation or vertical orientation respectively

10287591
hide	show
- show hide from dock works as expected

10287595
erd	diagram
if you already have an erd what additional alternate property do you want to illustrate with a uml class diagram that the erd doesn t give you

10287600
sorting	grouping
the problem arises from what access does behind the scenes in response to the report s sorting and grouping or aggregation

10287600
sorting	grouping
in report design remove everything form the sorting and grouping dialog and do not try to sum anything in the report header or report footer

10287633
instances	transient	persistent	transient
when we create instances in our java code the instances is considered to be a transient instances which means there is no mechanism in place to manage the persistent state of that instances

10287633
instances	transient	persistent	transient
however once we pass a transient instances to the save update or saveorupdate method of the hibernate session we consider the transient instances to have transitioned into a persistent instances as hibernate will begin to manage the persistent state of that instances

10287633
persistent	transient
a simple description of what we mean when we talk about transient persistent and detached objects

10287636
vim	emacs
if you are using vim emacs then this whole thing could be simplified by passing to a shell based sql beautifier but for the life of me i can t find one

10287672
post	get
this app has a variety of get and post operations that are accessed via jquery and exposed via mvc 3

10287672
post	get	webclient	webrequest
i m having difficulty figuring out how to get and post via the webclient and webrequest objects

10287674
pull	push
as long as you re sure people are using push and pull to get the changes to from the shared directories which is the only safe way

10287679
width	height
this is our scale factor that we ll use and multiply the height by to match your target width of 300px

10287695
int	double
but for defaulting only types listed in the default declaration of the module are considered - in the absence of a default declaration the default default of int double is assumed to resolve a constrained ambiguous type variable first int is tried and if that doesn t satisfy all constraints double is tried

10287695
int	double
in the case at hand neither int nor double satisfy the bounded constraint so defaulting fails

10287710
button	checkbox
further i d rather use or instead of or just remove the event altogether it defaults to the right value already valuechange which will render onclick in checkbox and radio button components

10287713
getter	setter
it declares a property which is syntactic sugar for getter and setter method declarations

10287713
getter	setter
it synthesises your previously declared property by creating the getter and setter methods

10287801
bufferstrategy	bufferedimage
double buffering techniques are for reducing or eliminating flickering in fast painting code which is what you should be accomplishing via the bufferstrategy internally using a bufferedimage

10287806
uilabel	uitextview
all text in a uilabel or uitextview has to be the same font color

10287838
post	get
however the basic idea is you get post using something like .post or .get in jquery to an action basically a url

10287851
uiview	calayer
when you need to draw content eg in the draw selector on your uiview subclass you should read currenttime from the calayer animation if necessary proceed through the avassetreader s video frames using copynextsamplebuffer until cmsamplebuffergetpresentationtimestamp returns currenttime draw the frame and then draw the calayer animation content over the top

10287947
mongodb	bson
i have a collection of documents in mongodb that has an attribute being stored as a string when it would work better if it was saved as bson objectid

10287978
hide	show
i was thinking that i could use the text value of the span id ctl00_m_g_c9d562b9_1531_47ac_b0f0_24f06ecea4cc_messagelabel you ve got to love sharepoint naming lol and jquery to show and hide the comments portion based on if there is a value of success

10288039
filtering	grouping
pig s language pig latin is a simple query algebra that lets you express data transformations such as merging data sets filtering them and applying functions to records or grouping of records

10288048
width	height
my thoughts where to find the lowest height rectangle and create a rectangle that fits the width of the remaining rectangles and with some recursion figure out the rest

10288075
mouse	keyboard	ubuntu	debian
if using this exact cpu is not super important i d recommend a beagleboard or pandaboard mainly because ubuntu has installers targeted to the boards and ubuntu debian offers opencv packages out of the box and this is going to remove a whole lot of hurdles if you re new to embedded development -- basically it turns your dev board into a full-featured computer just plug in a monitor keyboard and mouse

10288075
debian	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian
you may be able to install debian on your board and get access to opencv packages this way but i can t vouch for the ease-of-use of this method compared to ubuntu which is difficult enough especially if you re new to linux

10288140
min	max	minimum	max
can t you keep a queue with your numbers and their arrival times along with the current maximum minimum values in the queue will probably need to keep count of the number of values at the same min max and total value of all numbers in the queue and count of elements

10288140
min	max
then when a number arrives add it to the queue and adjust the min max value and count

10288140
min	max
then look at the other end of the queue and remove all elements that are not within 1 sec of the arrival of the last number and again adjust the max min count total value

10288140
min	max
then you don t need to keep calculate anything at an instant just return the precalculated stuff ie read the current value of min max or total count

10288140
min	max
as yaman pointed out you can t retain just the min and max as when one gets removed you might not know the new one

10288140
minimum	max
then you just add and remove each number from this list as well so you ll always know the max and minimum values

10288140
min	max
this saves you having to scan all elements in the buffer to find the new max min at the expense of keeping 2 copies but updates to this list should be cheap as it is already ordered

10288165
post	put
here is a simple function which you can put in you functions.php file and add your script code and it will only show up on the new edit post page

10288167
put	get
i need to get some information about some plants and put it into mysql table

10288190
min	max
articles are average 8kb size min is 2kb max is 12kb

10288195
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

10288199
min	max
as events come in buffer them completely and calculate a running sum count min max trivial

10288199
min	max
when a request for average min or max is made loop through from the back of the buffer and start removing values older than one second

10288199
min	max
in this scenario you have average min and max updated efficiently

10288199
min	max
if the values are below min or above max you ll need to loop through the rest of the array and recalculate it

10288199
min	max
that is keep the running min max sum and count on those 10 chunks

10288199
min	max
then when you reach an invalidation scenario you generally only need to look through the latest 100ms of data or a quick pass through the min and max of the other 9 chunks

10288199
min	max
ja72 provided a great idea to save on finding the min and max values if they are invalidated

10288199
min	max
instead of keeping the min max values x_min x_max keep instead the index of where they are located in the x i array with i_min and i_max

10288199
min	max
then finding them can be trivial sometimes but when the last value considered holds the min and max the entire list needs to be scanned to establish the new limits

10288203
post	get
the closest you can get is setting up a form with hidden fields that post to their server to log them in but they check the referer header so that doesn t work

10288217
width	height
layout the first line with the width limit and get line height and fitrange using ctframesettersuggestframesizewithconstraints

10288217
width	height
layout the second line below the first one with the proper width limit â from the height of preceding lines and the spacing you want you can calculate the origin.y of the current line which you use to figure out whether this line will run against the image continuing at the end of last fitrange

10288218
int	boolean
i have a dictionary of int boolean

10288220
min	max	minimum	max
if the deleted element is minimum or maximum you ll have to calculate new min max

10288220
min	max
if it isn t you will update min max according to the new arrivals

10288241
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox will just ignore the final comma

10288243
min	max
when an item is added if it s the new max or min adjust those variables accordingly

10288254
pop-up	dialog
currently when the user hovers their mouse over any image for 3 seconds a showupdateimagedialog method executes which causes a jquery dialog to pop-up

10288257
width	height
you can find the height and or width cggetimagewidth cggetimageheight

10288261
min	max
instead of keeping the min max values x_min x_max keep instead the index of where they are located in the array with i_min and i_max

10288261
min	max
then finding them can be trivial sometimes but when the last value considered holds the min and max the entire list needs to be scanned to establish the new limits

10288263
short	base
in short you cannot put a derived object in an array of base objects

10288264
min	max
if the numbers are coming one after the other then use a stopwatch and a while loop to get every number one by one for one second and calculate min max and avg

10288264
min	max
then return min max and avg

10288422
min	max
as btilly suggested in their comment on sam holder s post it would be more efficient to use a max heap and a min heap than to use a list we would again need to use a single node with pointers for both heaps and the list so we don t have to search for elements to remove them and it might be necessary to spend some time considering how to properly remove elements not at the top of the heap while maintaining the guarantee of o log n insertions and removals

10288535
junit	jmock
junit only has one jar so that s easy but jmock comes with over 10 different jars

10288554
width	height
i have figured out a few things namely that i can set the size of the widget using width and height options and that i can find the pixel height or width of said widget

10288571
google-chrome	firefox
if you are using internet explorer try using firefox or google-chrome and see if the problem persists

10288595
pull	push
i have a rails app hosted on heroku and i want to push the code to github aready created a repo on there .i tried to follow the steps in this question .since i already have a local repository and currently can push and pull from heroku i skipped step 2 and 3 .but when i do step 4

10288644
division	multiplication
multiplication division and other math functions will vary considerably in implementation depending on the numeric type so i ll need some sort of switch to determine whether to include certain headers and perhaps alter the implementation based on the numeric type

10288648
google-chrome	firefox
for example in firefox it contains the full path while in google-chrome it appears to contain only the filename haven t checked if it is the case with js access

10288652
width	height
there is only one parameter for something like width and height

10288656
ubuntu	linux
i m coding an app for linux ubuntu 11.04 with c# and mono

10288727
pull	push
now you can push and pull to any you like

10288753
post	get
on the post action i get this as null

10288764
width	height
akonsu is correct there is no support for width and height largely because calculating it is very expensive especially in vectors and groups with transformations on children

10288774
width	text-align
in that case you can use a combination of text-align center and width to get the desired effect

10288810
getter	setter
bean validation is performed on javabeans class fields with getter and setter

10288830
hide	show
so i am trying to use the validation code but in addition once all required fields are filled in and the submit button becomes active by it s return being set to true i want to a hide the form container div and b show a previously hidden div

10288832
width	height
the framelayout is set to fillparent width and height and the imageview is set to adjust view bounds so that the resulting imageview is a perfect square with each side being the length of the height of the landscape layout right aligned

10288832
width	height
the top left hand corner of the imageview is 0 0 and the bottom right corner would be the displayed width and height coordinates so that i can work out if the clicked point was past the mid-point of the imageview

10288888
profiling	debugging
set your project s debugging scheme s signing to use that developer profiling

10288895
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

10288895
google-chrome	firefox
load this in google-chrome or firefox and either refresh or hit the next button and you ll see it retrieves a new charity

10288905
cassini	iis
when you debug it locally make sure you are running the cloud project which uses iis and not the web project which will use cassini webdevserver which does not understand the system.webserver section

10288910
web-inf	facesservlet
assuming that the jar is placed in webapp s web-inf lib folder and that you re using jsf 2.x and that webapp s context path is contextpath and the facesservlet is mapped on an url pattern of then you can reference it by the following url

10288942

children	parent
this is because only the parent knows the amount of space available for each child this method is being called after all children are measured and the container knows it s own given size

10295144
children	parent	width	height
this method exists because if parent would set width and height on children directly they would immediately turn into fixed size children and they won t be measured anymore

10295144
children	parent	width	height
using this method only the rendering size is being changed - not the explicit width and height but _width and _height - meaning if for some reason the container resizes again the children will be resized by given rules percentage of the parent expanding to child component s children size etc.

10295144
width	height
by non attractive i consider the layout that isn t supposed to do anything smart like change the width and height of children at all like absolute layout

anyway it is rendered with proper width and height because at rendering time the dimensions are known

just adding that in case that the problem is that as images are loaded that might be before the form the form is being pushed down making hard to locate and edit it the only solution would be to add actual sizes width height through the style attribute to the images so that the browser can correctly calculate the final look of the page even before the images have loaded

it does not require pre-smoothing of noisy data but finds local max and min extrema with difference larger than parameter delta

10304023

provided implies that it will be provided later at runtime so don t include it in dependencies when packaging the application into a war or jar

10305120
jar	war
a good example of when this is used - when compiling against an api say the java ee api where you need the jar at compile time but you don t need to include it in the war file since the server will have those classes by definition

hide	show
becouse the code is runned from top to bottom start with always hide noresult and when it should be showed just show it like this

10305275
instances	transient
since some of your dependencies are registered per web request this means that they would get a new transient instances an exception is thrown when there is no web request which is they way this is implemented in the simple injector as is the case when you start a new thread to run the code

nsstream	nshost
the nsstream header file only declares class nshost

10307632
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
in your case since the myimageview frame is not filling up the entire screen frame the latter solution is probably the best one but just realize that the area where there isn t an image will be whatever back-most background color is uiviewcontroller s background or uiwindow depending on your setup

10307643

actionscript	mxml
basicaly the best thing to do is keep it simple use spark components and use actionscript renders rather than mxml to improve performance

10308473

what s really happening is a call to object.tostring which is inherited and has a built-in implementation for anonymous types that prints the properties and values

10308495
background-image	background-color	background-image	background-position
also since outlook 2007 and probably 2010 is using word as a rendering engine it will ignore certain styles such as background-image background-position too it will however accept bgcolor and background-color

10308510
filtering	grouping
from here on it s simple grouping by the post fields you need only grouping by the ones you output in the query and filtering using having so that you return only posts multiplied by all categories

innodb	myisam
oracle for that matter so i am debating between innodb or myisam engine for mysql

10308578
innodb	myisam
if you choose mysql then i would suggest you use innodb over myisam because of database transaction support with is important for financial transaction

10308597
webclient	httpwebrequest
here s a translation to httpwebrequest needed rather than webclient in order to set the referrer

10308610
16-bit	64bit
the first issue is that compilers add padding for alignment so what you think is a structure containing 16-bit limit and 64bit address is probably 16-bit limit 48-bits of padding that the cpu isn t expecting and 64bit address

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb is newer while myisam is older

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb has transactions while myisam does not

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

10308655
innodb	myisam
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not

10308655
innodb	myisam
the most important feature you need from innodb that myisam does not have is transactions

10308670

10311252
free	malloc
both answers explain the interaction and working of malloc and free in good detail without using very esoteric terms

10311252
free	malloc
to understand the difference between memory-management tools used by kernel brk mmap and those used by the c-compiler malloc free this is a must read

10311274
stdout	stderr
if you want to change the buffering behavior you must do so immediately after the fopen or before any i o for the standard filehandles stdin stdout stderr

10311326
free	malloc
of course the free library function either often makes the free memory zone reusable by further future calls to malloc or occasionally for large memory zones release some big memory chunk to the kernel using munmap 2 system call

10311326
free	malloc
the detailed behavior of free and malloc is implementation dependent

10311326
free	malloc
you should view malloc as a way to get heap memory and free as a way to say that a previously malloc -ed zone is useless and the system standard c library + kernel can do whatever it wants with it

10311342
mouseup	mousedown
the mouseup and mousedown events seem to work ok as the animation for a pressed button is working on middle click

10313023
setinterval	settimeout
you should pass a reference to a function as the first argument for settimeout or setinterval

10313023

although it s possible but you should not pass a string to settimeout or setinterval

10313023

10320398
children	parent
in each array the first element is the parent the rest are its children

10320398
children	parent
in this case a is the root element so comes b and c then under b is d e and f and under c is g and h and g also has h as children which means an element can have multiple parent

10320398
children	parent
so there is not particular order of children in each array but in the final result as shown below must have any parent before it s children

fast-forward	merge
but when bar was merge into master it was a fast-forward merge

10320472
fast-forward	merge
to get around that it s possible to tell git explicitly to avoid fast-forward merge that is every single merge should result in a merge commit with two parents even if a fast-forward merge would be possible

10320472
fast-forward	merge
unfortunately because that s a change in merging behavior rather than logging behavior you won t be able to do it retroactively -- the information from your previous fast-forward merge doesn t exist so there s no way to get git log to display it

10320906
typedef	struct
would go into a .c file or at least you would either extern the struct in a .h file and put the structure instantiation in a .c file or use typedef in the .h file

10321750
implements	extends
this looks to be confusion around extends thread versus implements runnable

10321842

the way to solve this is to make sure all of your projects are in a folder with the name that matches your project name otherwise it will dump all of your project files straight into the directory

10321856
haskell	ocaml
in many languages with strong type systems like felix ocaml haskell you can define a polymorphic list by composing type constructors

10322330
width	height
you don t need to declare position absolute in order to have width and height working

10322342

10322360
winpcap	libpcap
you can t do that with libpcap or winpcap

10322360
winpcap	libpcap
libpcap is built atop os mechanisms that do not support that those mechanisms exist to support passive packet capture and low-level packet capture and injection not to support packet modification in the packet input and output path and winpcap s driver is built atop an os mechanism of that sort

10322383
post	get
i think you would want to use the get or post method not request which is the base method

10322416

10322486
rubygems	rvm
from to handle the rvm rubygems rails install

10322504
width	height
then after you ve set the pagesize you can use width height and resolution on the printer to fint out that values here s what i got for letter dpi-values can be different they depend on the screen or the printer

10322504
width	height
the size returned by width and height is the page size same as pagerect .size which ist not the same as the paper size - as the page also has margins which you can set like this

10322519
width	height
ui controls and layout panes are regions all regions have read-only height and width properties you can listen to and bind to

10322519
width	height
you can not directly bind the height and width properties of a control to another value

10322519
width	height
the scene has height and width properties you can bind to if needed

10322519
width	height
if you don t set a height and width on the scene for a stand-alone app the scene and stage will be sized to fit the preferred size of the scene s root node which is usually what you want

uiview	subviews
on runtime i want maincontroller to allocate the necessary memory for the main view presented to the user and also add a subviews of my custom uiview this will be the canvas for drawing polygons

10322595
width	height
though it is growing everyday it is still missing a lot of ui elements that allows for easier content data placement and organization - such as a proper datepicker a content slider with better control over the content pulling content from ajax videos auto resize etc... a more proper accordion that allows for better control over the content through javascript auto height width on hover toggling and it is still lacking on other things such as dialogs animations effects and widgets

10322607
int	double

stdout stderr are still attached to the current shell but the ruby process isn t a child of the shell anymore so it won t get killed if you close the terminal

10322727
switching	screens
creating the screens with arguments -d -m should create it in background and not switching to it

10322739

10322746
int	chars
i have a program in which i m using the unsigned chars type to represent int but when inspecting the variables in the debugger with visual studio 2005 it s showing me the ascii chars representations whereas i would like to see the decimal representation

10322764
width	height
html tables of 100 width and height with disabled overflows are a good starting point imo - in the first iteration just order the pictures by size and make 8 templates like

10322843
setinterval	settimeout
your timer is lagging because you are using settimeout or setinterval

10322849
oncreate	setcontentview
what i mean is that the codes does what it s supposed to do however you should remove the setcontentview method at the top and place it at the end then you should set it to the relativelayout before you close the oncreate method

10322858
width	height
in drawrect use the view s own bounds to get the width and height not its frame

10322939
udp	tcp	udp	tftp	tftp	tcp
if you want the data to be routed you ll either to add an acknowledge + resend mechanism in your applications over udp see the tftp protocol for a naive one or use a more advanced protocol like tcp which will retry to send the data in case of packet loss - but will have a bigger overhead

10322985
setinterval	settimeout
you can do this easily using setinterval or a chained series of settimeout

10323043
int	double
these provide polimorphic function wrappers so you can do stuff like defining this function which takes an std function that takes two int and returns a double

10323144

atoi	strncpy
that is when you call strncpy with final set to 1 strncpy copies one character and does not append the terminating nul-character which will then cause atoi to fail

10328381
int	chars
if this is really huffman-coding you shouldn t be using atoi and int at all but just binary or chars strings

10328409
int	double
if not explicitly defined the compiler will quietly provide memberwise copy for object assignment which is ok for simple primitives like int and double but not necessarily for dynamically allocated objects

this is caused by trying to use lpszcontentlength which is a in this case a string of chars presumably representing a number as a size_t usually a long int

10328527
strtol	atoi
note that atoi doesn t detect errors - so once you re done with the tutorial it would be a good learning exercise to change to strtol with appropriate error checking

10328527
int	chars
these are both caused by lpszcontentlength being a string of chars when it needs to be an int type

rspec	minitest
it s up to you obviously but i d recommend using -- the thinking here being if minitest spec is modeled after rspec in syntax then you might as well put the tests in the same place that rspec puts them so people won t be put off guard

10329165
hash	md5
you would have to compute the same deterministic hash function in php and in your mobile app preferably a very complex one mixing your own dark encrypting algorithms with md5 sha1 synchronized threads etc

10329167
width	height
of course you can set its width and height properties to parent component but then it will overlap this parent component

10329229
hash	md5
even though the unique value generated by uniqueid function is really pretty unique there is considerable probability of collision when using md5 hash algorithm different values will result in the same hash value

i should face an application of estimating the size lengths width and height of cars in surveillance videos

10329803
width	height
if the grid needs to be able to grow just use the same trick arraylist uses keep track of current width height and if you need more just multiply available space by a suitable value for a 2d array doubling might be a bit much but it depends on the type of growth that is possible

accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
it seems to me that the only pattern which would allow us to release our outlet without an accessor is using a properties backed with an ivar so we can manually release our ivar in dealloc without using its accessor however this is the one option which apple s code-generation doesn t support

this basically means that right now drive apps are forced to use the oauth 2 server-side flow which is not going to be of any use to the javascript client library which only uses the client-side flow

10331393
client-side	server-side
the issue is that drive initiates a server-side oauth 2.0 flow then the javascript client library initiates a client-side oauth 2.0 flow

10331393
client-side	server-side
let developers choose which oauth 2.0 flow they want to use server-side or client-side or let the developer handle the oauth flow entirely

other obvious escaping mechanisms include encoding html characters using htmlspecialchars or htmlentities and the more generic quote escaping mechanisms addslashes and addcslashes

10342951
rspec	capybara
however request specs written in rspec without using capybara syntax do allow direct use of html verbs and some additional helpers as outlined in the rspec and rails docs

10342951

10344042
subtraction	addition
my original point at least as well as i remember it was that population counting is about equivalent to many other operations like addition and subtraction that we normally assume are o 1

10344042
subtraction	addition
even using fairly unlikely worst-case assumptions separate storage for each of those tables this would still be easy to implement in a modern cpu -- in fact it s probably at least somewhat simpler than the single-cycle addition or subtraction mentioned above 1

10344042
subtraction	addition
obviously enough the same is going to be true with the other trivial operations like addition subtraction bit-wise and bit-wise xor and so on

10344042
subtraction	addition
looked at in these terms a popcnt instruction falls about halfway between bit-wise and or xor on one hand and addition subtraction on the other in terms of the difficulty to execute in fixed time

10344098
int	double
right now i am declaring instance variables of int and double and assign the value to the correct type

i m stuck in a problem now i want to get the text be selectable but the text had been put into a uilabel so currently it s impossible for me to select change the uilabel to uitextview is not a good choice for me now since i just maintain the old code and only can make some little change on it but the latest command need me to implement this function on uilabel so anybody get any idea .or just give me some little instruction maybe good enough thanks a lot

declarations once you ve applied it to #nav this properties inherited down to all nested elements unless of course you have an intervening layer with text aligned left or center

10358485
inherited	properties
properties that inherited are listed here

10358540
cpython	pypy
to illustrate a python python comparison i just tested your script on cpython 2.7.3 and pypy 1.8 on the same machine

10358546
post	get
although i m sure in your real program you have that search value coming from a url encoded form through get or post so the encoding on the js file wouldn t matter

10358576
width	height
i am trying to get the image width and height from a image drag and drop html 5 file api

10358612
activemq	rabbitmq
the some routing logic box could be an esb or in this very case be implemented in the messaging server for instance activemq with virtual destinations or websphere mq or perhaps rabbitmq among others

10358619
int	chars
a chars is a disguised int

10358619
int	chars
a chars represents a chars by coding it into an int

10358619
int	chars
when you add them together you get an int which is the sum of the code of the chars and the value of the int

10358620
int	chars
instead of int you declare ans as a chars

10358623
chown	chmod
if you have ssh access log in and use chmod and or chown on the command line

10358634
manual	jmp
i read the manual more carefully now especially the pseudocode for the call ret and jmp instructions since they are at liberty to change the rip

10358638
int	chars
chars in java can be promoted to int so if you ask to add an int like 1 to a chars like 1 alias 49 the more narrow type chars is promoted to int getting 49 + 1 50

10358640
uilabel	uibutton
you should probably be using uibutton instead of uilabel

10358643
inherited	subclassing
a uilabel is not a subclassing of uicontrol which gives you the inherited functionality that you want

10358644
typedef	struct
use the struct keyword for structures and only use typedef when you re either a defining an opaque type that might be implemented as anything or b defining an alias for an arithmetic type you might want to change in the future or in different configurations for example if you want to be able to choose float or double

10358652
int	chars
chars is really just a two-byte unsigned int

10358674
istream	getline
std getline istream ... to read one line at a time

10358713
pull	push
for some of them when i create a local tracking branch git push -u origin mybranch or --set-upstream origin mybranch i can pull and push to that branch with git pull git push respectively and it all works fine

10358713
pull	push
but other in other cases other projects when i try the same scenario i can pull git pull but i have to specify origin and the branch when i push - git push origin mybranch

10358713
pull	push
in the one that works p1_branch shows both push pull entries in the remote show output

10358741
put	get
when i directly override the get set methods i see that they are being used by the proxy to put raw data into the model

10358785
for-loop	arrays
i m thinking i need to do a for-loop with an arrays or a jquery.each function but not certain how the best way to approach this is

10358809
activiti	drools
that would include a service container a routing engine camel a messaging layer activemq etc. on top of that just add in nice high level open source components for rules drools and bpm activiti

10358824
children	parent
i need to map some parent children relationship on top of a legacy database the problem is how the tables are structured

10358885
pop-up	dialog
also if you did not supply an owner for the dialog when you created it you should use setlocationrelativeto owner to make it pop-up in the center of the owner

10358886
folder	directory
when working with branches i need to check out all files in branchi right under proj but not in a branchi sub folder in order to keep the above flat directory structure

10358924
equals	compareto
use the instance compareto string anotherstring or equals object method to compare the contents of strings i.e

10358936
children	parent
each object would manage its relationships similar to activerecord and would know how to get children and parent

10358942
int	chars
1 int to represent number of rows max number of chars in middle

10358995
super	self
if you fail to assign self to the result of super s initializer or if you fail to check for nil then you may be holding on to a dangling deallocated pointer exc_bad_access and you may not initialize your ivars properly you would effectively assign them to another region if an exc_bad_access were not encountered

10359000
super	self
when you call super hdonor self and self is actually a child of hdonor super s result will pass function calls to hdonor class not the hbatom as you expected

10359074
udp	tcp
the client only receives packets and server only sends. udp or tcp

10359083
onresume	onpause
nope this actually only called the super class onpause and onresume without doing anything else

10359083
onresume	onpause
so you have to save them onpause and restore them on the onresume to avoid this

10359105
uilabel	uibutton
the easiest way to accomplish this is to put a uibutton over your uilabel and set the type to custom

10359140
ssl	https
there are many many classes and code snippets showing how to do this https get ssl with android and self-signed server certificate but i can t find any that show how to actually use the classes

10359162
libjpeg	libpng
moreover it will use other libraries like libpng or libjpeg for images libalsa for sound etc

10359186
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i just want to call viewdidload or viewdidappear on the current active view controller when applicationdidbecomeactive gets called so i can reset some animations or whatever when the app is started up again from the background

10359189
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking at this in firefox google-chrome on a mac.

10359209
for-loop	loops
in the for-loop they cease to exist as soon as loops makes one iteration if you create the labels before loops they cease to exist at the end of the function

10359221
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome but not in firefox 11

10359239
spaces	delimiter
the default delimiter is spaces and tab

10359261
ubuntu	debian
to use them in your program you have to #include the corresponding headers for example to use the gtk libs the headers aren t installed by default in many distros for example in debian and ubuntu you have to download the package with apt-get

10359296
int	chars
if x is only one chars it could even be represented by a single int variable

10359327
stdout	stderr
when executing a batch file with ant s apply or exec tasks on windows i found there are special cases where some of the stdout and stderr is not captured by ant

10359327
stdout	stderr
it seems that the batch file s stdout and stderr is captured however commands called by the batch file are somehow not seen by ant

10359327
stdout	stderr
using the output and error attributes as suggested above doesn t help because only some of the stdout and or stderr is captured

10359343
google-chrome	firefox
i am having a button which point to a actionlink that i render with jqueryui button all i want is the rendering visual of the button and keeping its normal behavior on google-chrome fine the button points to the actionlink but on firefox 11 when i click the button nothing happens

10359343
google-chrome	firefox
this is working on google-chrome but non firefox 11

10359362
ssl	https
if your application is communicating to a https server having ssl certificate you can compare the server certificate received from the server received in above mentioned method with server certificate embedded in your application

10359447
int	double
everything on this line is of type double with the exception of the loop index nn which is of type long unsigned int

10359447
int	double
the cast from long unsigned int to double generates the assembly instruction fxtod which the profiler flagged

10359447
int	double
as a test i removed the reference to nn from the line thus removing the cast from unsigned int to double and the execution time of the loop reduced by almost a half in a loop that performs about a dozen floating point operations on an ultrasparc iv processor

10359449
portrait	landscape
i am recording video using mediarecorder.i have surfaceview attached to the recorder for preview.i have different layouts for portrait and landscape.now the preoblem is that when i change the orientation surface is getting created again ofcourse it is so as it is different for landscape n portrait ..in this case inorder to get the preview i have to stop then prepare the recorder with new surface and start recorder again.is it possible to change the preview surface while recording

10359553
queue	fifo
the idea is that you use an auxiliary queue to maintain the items to be processed and rely on the fifo ordering of the queue to process the items in order and in parallel

10359586
google-chrome	firefox
i am running the grid on a ubuntu headless server and my remote controls on one windows 7 machine running ie9 and firefox and a windows vista machine running ie8 and google-chrome

10359597
springsource	grails
i m using grails 2.0.3 from within springsource tool suite 2.9.1 eclipse on windows 7

10359635
folder	directory	ubuntu	linux
i m on ubuntu linux so i have an images folder inside my src directory

10359640
versioning	upgrade
first up upgrade to the latest versioning 2.0.6 there are serious security issues with vm prior to 2.0.6 even 2.0.4 had serious security fixes and would be would be better

10359677
uiview	calayer
alternatively you can also use a generic uiview object and assign your image as the content of the viewâ s calayer object

10359679
versioning	upgrade
it makes no sense to me at all since i have an upgrade versioning of such framework

10359710
rss	feed
but it s not a valid rss feed as it doesn t have the required elements as well as adding in others that do not fall in the rss specifications

10359748
istream	getline
hint 2 getline returns result rtfm if you would use c version or for c++ and corresponding istream methods

10359750
puts	fflush
ios app instead puts it at the end of the file every time you fflush your stream

10359783
post	get
i have few functions that sanitize everything in get and post but this one must be bit more specific i have an array that is producing links like

10359783
post	get
also have a function that is sanitizing get and post but that function would clear everything from this array values so i am left with

10359799
width	height
the css sets the link to be a block element thus occupying the width and height of the div

10359803
post	get
i ll post more once you get this working

10359811
put	get
you now have an application-level usersession object that is specific to that user that you can put get stuff

10359816
spaces	delimiter
words within phrases are delimiter by spaces

10359828
int	chars
followingconcernedoftunbridgew s suggestion if you maintain a two-column table with a primary key int column hr that goes from 0 to 23 and a chars 20 column rng containing the space-prefixed range string for each hour

10359848
textview	imageview
i want to center the textview with the imageview above it

10359851
for-loop	arrays
in your threeofakind method the second for-loop will only get executed once unless the first number stored in your arrays is a 2 it should look more like this

10359874
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
note if you are constantly adding removing items from existingholdings then you could use sorteddictionary which should be faster sortedlist is faster for accessing elements but takes longer adding removing

10359883
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
i want to create my own file with icon that inherit from jframe icon that i set it in java and my own file use fileoutputstream and objectoutputstream

10359887
width	height
the reason you are always seeing 500x375 as your width and height is because those are the default values of the mxmlc compiler specifically the -default-size option

10359933
put	get
get the innerhtml of that object and put that innerhtml into the #content item

10359945
width	height
say a tile should always occupy 5 of the screen s width and 6 of the screen s height then the scaling would look like

10359945
width	height
you can get the screen s width and height using graphicsdevice.viewport.width height

10359959
des	rsa
first i will use rsa to send the des key between the two sides client to server

10359959
des	rsa
i sent the rsa public used it and sent the des key encrypted to the server and decrypted

10359978
setinterval	settimeout
one thing you can do is to use settimeout instead of setinterval so you get

10360054
width	height
add the optional width and height fields as url parameters

10360054
width	height
where width and height are your requested dimension values

10360054
width	height
this will return a profile picture with a minimum size of width x height while trying to preserve the aspect ratio

10360054
width	height
maximum width and height of 50 pixels

10360054
width	height
maximum width of 50 pixels and a maximum height of 150 pixels

10360054
width	height
maximum width of 100 pixels and a maximum height of 300 pixels

10360054
width	height
maximum width of 200 pixels and a maximum height of 600 pixels

10360079
x86	64bit
it s a command line driven tool available in c program files microsoft sdks windows phone v7.1 tools isolatedstorageexplorertool c program files x86 microsoft sdks windows phone v7.1 tools isolatedstorageexplorertool on a 64bit machine

10360122
min	max
this xslt 1.0 solution uses recursive templates to parse a delimited list of values to return the min max value from the list

10360140
outputstream	inputstream
if that s not an attractive option you could still write your information to an outputstream which is then piped to an inputstream elsewhere in your app

10360224
width	height
since you re implementing the callback you should have the surfacechanged surfaceholder holder int format int width int height method somewhere

10360224
width	height
you can use the passed in width and height parameters to calculate the scale and appropriately scale down the bitmap

10360259
int	chars
a possibility would be using lists of chars as length-1 strings or maybe code units as int instead of strings so you can overwrite that list after use but that would require every code that touches it to support this format if even a single one of them creates a string with its contents it s over

10360262
width	height
in onclick event however you get position of item clicked so just design a new layout file with imageview will width and height fill parent and create a activity that show this layout file

10360291
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
in other words use an mdpi device to figure out the relative size on the screens and from there on apply the given scaling ratios to produce resources for the ldpi hdpi and xhdpi buckets

10360291
screens	mdpi
obviously you do not actually have to scale up that mdpi resource - all you need determine is the size for that screens density and then you can use whatever source file to produce images for all buckets

10360291
screens	mdpi
with this information you can easily verify that 1dp on an mdpi device with 160dpi screens is equal to 1px

10360320
public	protected
if i understand correctly with __set you can create class variables on the fly which will be public as well as access private protected properties

10360320
mutators	setter
with individual setter mutators 1 for each protected private property you have individual validation control but you have to write a bunch of setter

10360364
pull	push
they push and pull realtime data through xmpp

10360377
versioning	upgrade
and the fix to your problem is to upgrade your ghc to a versioning adhering to the newer haskell2010 standard

10360380
post	get
its really simple we start by declaring ajax function then we declare the method get or post - just like html form data is used the parameters to be passed through url

10360388
int	boolean
empty seems to use a boolean length an int i guess

10360407
width	height
so what you need to to do is try using the same height and width of the created bitmap while drawing it on the canvas.sometimes it may become right.this piece of code may help you

10360463
hash	md5
i have a md5 hash for example 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592 and i want to find another string that has the same hash

10360494
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
you can do url configurations like this in apache lighttpd nginx and i ve seen it done on occasion but to some doing it this way would be a big learning curve

10360523
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tested in google-chrome opera firefox ie.

10360531
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
till now i ve been using controller or controllers like uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller to manage the uiviewcontroller hierarchy

10360538
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
upon login - you concatenate the session id a salt and the users password hash into a string and then md5 hash it

10360538
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
now when they request a page you just select from the database where an md5 hash of the users password session id and salt the auth cookie

10360547
hash	md5
of course you could just do a google for md5 hash lookup and just input your existing md5 hash and get the string result

10360617
for-loop	loops
a range-based for-loop is just syntactic sugar for normal loops using iterators so the above applies

10360630
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
try to do that in viewwillappear or viewdidappear instead

10360642
expander	togglebutton
i have an expander that located in a canvas and want to expand it up but it s togglebutton move to down when it opens.whats the problem this is my code

also note that you shouldn t use get method to delete records - only post

10360746
couchbase	couchdb
i am looking to use erlang chicagoboss webserver to develop webapp with couchbase couchdb as backend

10360775
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
a radiobuttonlist a button a checkboxlist and a datagrid

10360776
for-loop	loops
if this is the case then your syntax is messed up in the third section of your for-loop where you set and that is exactly where the exception is being thrown because this part gets executed before the comparison of takes place and breaks you out of loops

10360788
gif	png
here i need to create thumbnail of jpg png and gif images

10360801

though it occurs in ie and google-chrome and firefox so it could just be sloppy coding i am a big newb

10360964
mouseleave	mouseenter
so i gave up on that and tried mouseenter mouseleave combo

10361015
queue	fifo
for most queue this is fifo but a priorityqueue actually uses a comparator or natural ordering to sort tasks as they are inserted

10361016
profiler	vtune
a yes on a single threaded cpu a profiler like oprofiler or vtune will attribute time to functions waiting on cache misses

10361016
cpu	hyperthreading
it actually still works for a multithreaded cpu like intel hyperthreading

10361028
post	put	post	get	put	get
this applies the same across any kind of request get post put delete

10361028
post	put	post	get	put	get
this works for any kind of http request get post put delete

10361028
post	get
typically query parameters are passed as part of the url string for get requests and in the request body for post requests

10361047
put	get
the method above may get called frequently so you can put code that only needs to happen once somewhere else.

10361091
post	get
incase you do not have access to globals in your wpf project the correct way to get it you can find at post get the excel cell address from a udf see if this helps

10361112

10361190
centos	linux
works for me here on linux centos

10361216
g++	gcc
for profiling applications you can use aqtime 7 standard free at the moment or gprof if you re compiling with gcc g++

10361248
int	double	int	chars
the buffer element type must be one of the predefined types sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars float double or bool

10361249
installation	upgrade
this is a much more elegant solution that can scale is testable safe against upgrade and allows you to reuse it as needed across multiple sites and installation

10361251
int	boolean
it can cause an exception reading this instances in case if new field have primitive type int long boolean

10361264
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
you can view its lock code through freebsd svn viewvc for head usr.bin lock cvs and perforce are also available

10361264
openbsd	freebsd
a major functionality difference will be in the authentication method for the -p option â œuse login password authenticationâ the openbsd code uses its own authentication system and freebsd uses crypt 3 which will not work for most mac os x accounts

after reading about the many different ways to do it in gwt i decide to use requestfactory because apparently it the most affective way to write maintainable application

10361475
requestfactory	gwt
the problem is that there is no tutorial about requestfactory and eclipse is hard enough to manage when you know if it even harder to manage when i m using a new tool like gwt

10361475

getter	setter
this will provide a public getter as a const cannot have a setter

10362134
countdowntimer	timertask
i am afraid that it is not possible to pause or stop countdowntimer and pausing or stopping in ontick has no effect whatsoever user timertask instead

10362149
pop-up	dialog
so basically what it does is when the user tries to navigate away it pop-up the yes no dialog

10362167
pop-up	dialog
i would like to post a message on the wall without a dialog to pop-up

10362179
metaclass	subclassing
your metaclass will almost certainly be a subclassing of type because you probably don t want to make your different kind of class completely different

10362185
getter	setter
you have to keep in mind the reason for the existance of getter setter

10362185
public	protected
setting the constant to public is completely acceptable since it is not a private variable that needs to be protected

10362196
stdout	stderr
below is a modified version of your script you basically need to understand that some applications have thiere standard output towards stderr standard error so when you don t see thier output put in a variable you just need to redirect it to stdout standard outputp

10362203
accessor	properties
you could declare a properties with only a get accessor without even declaring the set accessor not even private

10362217
hide	removeclass
as dfsq said i just had to use removeclass hide instead of toggle

10362226
versioning	upgrade
you should also upgrade xdebug to the latest versioning

10362231
clang	llvm
i d suggest you to have a look at llvm in combination with clang

10362291
int	chars
by the way casting int i to a chars will print out 333 assuming input is 3

10362305
int	chars
to display 3 instead of the 51 you need to cast the int to chars before printing it

10362312
switching	screens
android recommends fragments to more of support high variation in screens sizes but switching from tabactivity to fragments just to replicate same feature won t be good idea .

10362330
rss	feed
my google appengine app does a url fetch to a remote server to sync rss feed from a remote location and shows to users on the client side

10362330
rss	feed
these rss feed have different time zones

10362372
put	get
you can get the list of number from another query and put it in a in condition so for example

10362374

all modern browsers supports html5 now - firefox google-chrome and opera

10362378
firefox	safari
i ve got a strange problem on firefox that seems not to happen on safari

10362409
des	rsa
long story short i m using des and i m encrypting a password using rsa for key exchange the password does not exceed 16 characters

10362429
post	get
other way to do this one way is to include nooflikes and noofcomments in post table so in order to get popular post i will have to access only post table but the problem with this approach is whenever a user makes a comment over a post then i will have to increment noofcomments in post table as well as make a entry in comments table problem starts when the increment is successfully made to post table and before making change to the comments table connection is lost

10362457
http	spdy
spdy has a number of advantages that go beyond what http pipelining can offer which are described in the spdy whitepaper

10362457
http	spdy
spdy compresses headers using an algorithm which is specific to that task stateful and with knowledge of what is normally in http headers

10362465
jar	war
now when i am running the application in my jboss as7 server in built in eclipse the jar s from the maven dependency does not copied in the lib of the war file and for that reason i am getting classnotfoundexception

i personally prefer 1 firefox 2 safari

10362602
pthreads	fork
if you want to make it a valid php script it is going to be a lot of work but if you re using pthreads you can use fork which will make it relatively simple

10362660
int	boolean
so far so good expr1 represents the int constant 42 expr2 and expr3 the boolean constants true and false

10362660
int	boolean
the expressions we have seen so far except number 6 all have a value expr1 has the int value 42 the rest are boolean true false true false for expr s 2 through 5

10362660
int	boolean
as you can see the values are either int or boolean and so can be represented as values of type value

10362660
int	boolean
in words the evaluator should return the value of a constant expression and if the expression is a logical and it should return the logical and of the values of constituent expressions which need to be boolean values - you can t take the logical and of an int and a boolean or two int

10362660
int	boolean
the problem boils down to the fact that expr values can either have a boolean or an int value and you can t see that type anymore so it s possible to and two expressions together for which this doesn t make sense

10362660
int	boolean
one way to solve this would be to split expr into two new expression types one having int values and the other with boolean values

10362660
int	boolean
the evaluator would also need two versions one for int expressions and one for boolean expressions

10362660
int	boolean
instead of saying the type of an expression is an int or a boolean but i don t know just yet and running into problems when evaluating expressions we make sure from the beginning that we know the type of the value of an expression and that we don t combine them in ways that don t make sense

10362660
int	boolean	int	chars
simple things to try are making an expression that adds two int values using string or chars constants or making an if-then-else expression which takes three arguments the first of boolean type and the second and third of the same type but that type could be int bool chars or whatever

10362681
16-bit	64bit
addresses can and usually are greater than what 8 bits can hold cl is 8-bit cx is 16-bit ecx is 32-bit rcx is 64bit

10362717
post	get
i ve spent the last +24 hours reading post and experimenting to try to get the result i want

10362718
post	get
that means that with your schema it s actually impossible to get the most liked commented post without retrieving all of them

10362727
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and ie9+ report the offsetwidth correctly after the the ready state is complete but firefox hasn t seem to have calculated it yet

10362800
button	checkbox
in one viewmodel there is a button and a checkbox

10362800
button	checkbox
now if the button was hit then on the other viewmodel should be checked if the checkbox is set too

10362842
versioning	upgrade
perhaps it is because you have hard coded the versioning number 12 into your openhelper and your previous database was also versioning 12 so no upgrade is being performed and the database is being left in its current state

10362852
primefaces	icefaces
i m using icefaces datatable but with primefaces datatable it will be the same

10362886
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
coming from qt i always use qgraphicsscene in association with qgraphicsitem objects to draw stuff like flowcharts game boards et cetera

10362889
textview	imageview
you have to create a textview and a imageview separated

10362927
actualheight	actualwidth
specifies a handler for the resized event that occurs when the silverlight plug-in s object tag is resized and the actualheight or the actualwidth of the silverlight plug-in change

10362927
actualheight	actualwidth
this is fired when the actualheight or actualwidth properties change - but not when the silverlight plugin is in full screen mode

10363001
draggable	droppable
my case a planning with droppable divs representing each employee and draggable resizable divs representing tasks

in google-chrome opera firefox - it works

10363085
inherited	subclassing
i have a set of related models in my rails application that i want to store in the same mongodb collection - i have been using mongoid inherited i ve stripped down the models for brevity but have different fields in the different subclassing so i dont want to solve the problem by just having a single class and a phone_type field

10363089
division	multiplication
i have seen that armadillo does have element wise multiplication and division but no indication that a generalized function is available

10363090
scheme	racket
i have noticed that people often act as though scheme and racket are the same thing here on stack overflow and also elsewhere on the web

10363090
scheme	racket
for example questions about scheme often generate solutions in racket

10363090
scheme	racket
if you take a look at the questions tagged scheme you ll see that half of their answers start with #lang racket

10363090
scheme	racket
is racket just an extension of scheme scheme code will always run on a racket interpreter

10363113
put	get
so i need to find the application sandbox of the iphone simulator and get this database to later put it into main bundle later on

10363117
scheme	racket
however the racket implementation can run standard scheme code

10363117
scheme	racket
racket is not a superset or subset of scheme

10363150
src	attr
the attr src .. should only be called once or every time you want to load the page

10363158
memcached	apc
i have apc and memcached varnish cache and fooman speedster running

10363170
scheme	racket
racket is very close to scheme and in fact until two years ago it was called plt scheme

10363170
scheme	racket
however the default language that is used in racket diverges from scheme in a few places most notably it has immutable pairs

10363170
scheme	racket
it s also not something that is unique to racket the scheme standard s are so minimalistic that the language that they define is impractical which means that all scheme implementations add their own extensions

10363170
r5rs	r6rs
another important point in the racket case is that defining new dialects is very easy -- and racket implements a strict r5rs dialect the fact that it s strict means that it s not very useful and it also implements an r6rs dialect

10363174
folder	directory
i ve put some images in a folder in the same directory as the .cs and .xaml files

10363174
put	get
now i try to put them in the webbrowser control but i can t seem to get this to work

10363188
ant	maven
i will look into this and will be looking for details on how to configure this via ant eclipse and maven

10363199

in google-chrome firefox i can specify which content script are injected into which sites based on url matching

10363416
crypt	hash
you should use php s crypt or hash for hashing passwords rather than sha-1

10363427
put	get
my approach for now is to make it in a qtextedit when the user click the button i get the signal and using the cursor index i put html tag but i don t know if it s a good idea

10363441
width	height
in the function rounded_rectangle left top width and height are the parameters for the bounding rectangle and radius is the radius of the corner arc

10363447
width	height
by passing the width of a video you can get the ratio of height 4 3

10363483
jtable	jlabel
jtable supports html it uses jlabel string parser renderer so you can insert e.g

10363514

10363568
websphere	ibm
the largest openlaszlo applications i m aware of are laszlo webtop 120k+ lines of lzx code and ibm websphere commerce edition i ve heard that other companies have created equally large applications using openlaszlo

10363568
versioning	upgrade
the last major release 4.0 has been in march 2007 although the openlaszlo team considered the 4.2 release to be equal to a major versioning upgrade since it added the actionscript 3 and swf9 support to the platform

10363571
post	get
think of cf and most web servers systems as accepting input url get form post cookie etc and returning output html json text etc

10363584
onchange	onblur
edit you probably only want to validate when the value changes and field loses focus that s why imo the onchange event would be more appropriate than onblur not onblure

10363604
ant	maven
print out the environmental variables when you are running via ant and also under maven and make a comparison to determine the source of the missing library error

10363604
maven	pom.xml
alternatively you can configure the pom.xml manually see the exec maven plugin page that has examples and descriptions for the two goals

10363611
mamp	wamp
also this i only have this problem with mamp not with wamp and also not on any other server until now

after checking the checkbox on send button click i am reading the status of the checkbox like the code written below but it is showing me unchecked

10363662
integer	unsigned
so the first warning is referring to the fact that dword_ptr is a pointer sized unsigned integer

10363679
google-chrome	safari
i found i could improve the situation a little with css dedicated to webkit safari google-chrome

10363679
width	height
however i had to set a fixed width and height on the field because the font change will resize the field

10363776
google-chrome	safari
the problem is occurring in safari and google-chrome

10363778
maven	pom.xml
if you have a pom.xml you can set up your project to be maven compatible and then run maven -- it will download all the required .jars and set up the classpath correctly if the pom.xml file is configured right

10363779
onchange	onblur
the event triggered in that case is onblur not onchange

10363781

also read qtextcursor and qtextdocument documentation

10363912
ant	maven
i ll be very surprised if this is a maven ant issue

10363923
cvs	svn
even more confusion is caused by developers attempting to use a version control system eg cvs git svn to distribute their software rather than building tarballs

10363939
fadein	fadeout
because fadeout and fadein are asynchronous functions the script continues to run those causing your img to change its position immediately

10363961

well the issue is that this script was made for pixels it works if you are using width and height for flash in pixels while i can t use pixels as i am using ages this way user have ability to go full screen optionally by pressing f11

10364145
inherited	properties
use customannotaion which is inherited by mkannotation only in that class assign your own properties like locationdetails locationimage etc

free	malloc
anyways so i decided to malloc the qapplication and then try to free it just before the program closes

10364545
int	double
you do run the risk of hardware+os error in the int to double conversion hauser made some comments about fpu errors tending to be in the int to float and float to int operations

- md5 hash generated second 159380

10364772
prng	random
this way i have a random password which is generated using a suitable-for-cryptography prng not class random see this question for details on why class random is not okay here and which can be represented as a string and sent in an email shown in an interface or typed in or copy-pasted by the user

10364786
hash	salt
the point of the salt hash is to build a verification system whereby you do not have to store their password in the first place but you can still verify that they know their password

10364795
int	boolean
i have an application that reads data from large files and produces objects of various types boolean int string that are categorized in a few less than a dozen groups and then stored in a database

hide	show
and is it possible at all to hide a scroll view in order to just show a regular screen in the same view

10364850

subtraction	modulo
not to mention that you re calling an external process every time you re doing subtraction or taking the modulo which can get expensive

10365045
profiler	aqtime
on windows you ll have to search for allocation profiler there s purify and aqtime 7 use _crtdumpmemoryleaks msvc specific may produce false positives or write custom memory manager that overrides global operator new delete and reports memory usage

10365082
min	max	range	min	range	max

10365087
width	height
but i intend to put that under limitations because i can t work on it i don t have enough time i m still getting poor gaze width and gaze height

10365117
width	height
if i remember correctly -- it s been a while -- there is no width or height until there is something in the movieclip

10365154
factors	mean
if you don t mind a small constant factors o n memory cost you could restart every n values eg million - smarter still would be to adapt this value by detecting when precision is too low storing previous mean and stdev and then combine for the final result so your mean is the appropriately weighted value from the recent running total and the old binned values

10365157
free	malloc
this optimization may be allowed only for pair of malloc free when both functions are in the same function or even in the same block of and free is called every time when malloc is called

10365157
free	malloc
ps update1 we can limit our discussion only to cases when compiler knows that malloc and free is from libc stdlib

10365161
put	get
as performing a get and then a put

10365166
onkeyup	onkeydown
note it is worth noting that onkeydown will fire multiple times before onkeylongpress does so you may want to trigger on onkeyup instead or other logic to prevent acting upon a series of onkeydown calls when the user is really holding it down

10365193
put	get
i am trying to make python allow private variable so i made this decorator that you put at the begging of a class so that every function will get an additional private parameter that they can modify to be what they want

google-chrome	firefox
apparently ie9 doesn t report the height of the html tag as other browsers such as firefox and google-chrome do

10365205
free	malloc	free	alloca	alloca	malloc
if a compiler optimized malloc + free into an alloca the observable behavior of the code would change for some inputs it wouldn t crash with malloc + free but it would with alloca because the stack space got exhausted

10365205
free	malloc
the optimization performed by llvm and mentioned in the comments is a different thing it only optimizes out malloc s that are only compared to null and then free d

10365207
getter	setter
it s also worth noting that in python setter getter are pointless

i ve tried vim but it s modal so i prefer emacs

10365262
for-loop	loops
i m trying to use uialertviews inside a for-loop to sum numbers which shall be input in the alert view s text box but the problem is that the alert shows up as many times as the for-loop runs and i don t know how to make loops wait for a button press on the alert view and then loops again

10365271
post	get
the first one is that your form is being submitted using the get method but you re trying to retrieve your values in php as if it had been submitted with the post method

10365332

10365499
required	placeholder
this would required a lot of extra cleverness on the part of the compiler though and the scala language designers have decided that it s not worth itâ that placeholder syntax only needs to be provided for some fairly simple cases without nested expressions

for-loop	arrays
assuming that you re gathering your initial integer from a starting point and adding to it on each for-loop iteration the following is a simple methodology to create a string arrays rather than an int arrays

10365577
for-loop	arrays
if you need both int and string arrays with the same values in them create them both in the same for-loop and be done with it

i tried on google-chrome firefox and safari they all honor the flush request

10365728
children	parent
the position is out of bounds which returns null causing your nullpointerexception since the only children of parent are the visible ones instead try a faster simpler approach

10365732
post	get
you ve got two input fields with the same name so only one will be returned on post get

10365756

update instead of upgrading to 11.2 versioning i upgrade to 11.1

10365785
uiview	subviews
but if it were me doing this my first approach would be to get a handle to the uiview i want to copy then recursively iterate all the subviews of it and then copy add them as subviews to the uiview i want to copy the main uiview into

10365839
uiview	subviews
create another instance of the uiview you wish to clone and add it as a subviews to another view

hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

10365957
post	get
yes you should never accept user input from a form post data as part of a url get data or even a cookie without first checking it is what you would expect

10365957
hash	md5
i would also store the password as a md5 hash of what the user entered when they signed up so you get the password at signup check it has a limited range of characters do hass_pw md5 password and store the hash_pw in the d b

10365979
ssl	https
if you re not using single-sign on sso for authenticating to your website but use plain usernames and passwords in a form transmitting that over an ssl tls connection from your application will be no different from doing so from a browser over https provided that the overall configuration is correct

10366025
rdf	owl
owl is also rdf and you can use jena to load it into tdb

10366059
int	chars
you passing chars from command line anyway just because there is no int on keyboard

10366059
int	chars
so you need to convert this chars arrays which are wrapped into string into int

10366060

if you try on your parent pom.xml project you will get a release.properties file that shows you the release configuration maven would have used if it had actually performed the prepare goal

10366172
std	ostream
note that i have explicitly used std ostream since ostream is in the std namespace

10366173
post	put
if your workflow is to put each image in a directory with a post finding them starts to require a significant amount of searching and you have to come up with something different for images that don t belong to a specific post

10366186
hide	show
the indicator show properly in cellforrowatindexpath but does not hide and the accessory type doesn t change in the completed method

10366214
mouseleave	mouseenter
if the mouseenter or hover is different from the mouseleave then you ll need to track this using a variable

10366214
mouseleave	mouseenter
on mouseleave you can then reference that variable just remember to clear or reset the value for the next time the mouseenter even is fired

10366224
thin	webrick
i couldn t figure out what was going on so i uninstalled thin and went back to webrick to get some things done

10366252
g++	gcc
not mentioned by op but assuming it is using gcc g++ to build code

10366283

10366511
folder	directory
when i load https localhost kow it loads the correct controller however for some reason its not reconizing that kowmanager is a sub directory of kow with its own application folder and it should be loading the default controller that is set in its routes file

10366534
udp	tcp
3- testing tcp and udp socket servers using c# and .net

10366542
for-loop	loops
loops and recur forms create an iteration - like a for-loop in other languages

10366546
header-files	stdafx.h
all the header-files that i use are included in stdafx.h but that s obviously not the problem here same problem when including the header-files directly

10366554
allocator	stl
all containers in the stl are parameterized with template arguments usually the last argument is called a or allocator and defaults to where .

10366632
versioning	upgrade
however note that your database will be upgrade to the new 11.0 file format which means you won t be able to detach attach or backup restore to an older versioning 2008 2008 r2 etc

10366650
google-chrome	firefox
fwiw i tested on google-chrome and firefox

10366667
pull	push
i can issue commands via . adb shell like ls but not push and pull and when i do . adb devices it shows my device id but when i start an interactive shell adb devices shows nothing

i can still list files in the interactive shell but still no push or pull

10366670
g++	gcc
i wrote this code for matrix multiplication in simd which i was able to compile in visual studio but now i need to compile it in ubuntu using gcc g++

10366691
put	get
i expect to get a list of the distinct 4 letter substring from the file name what i get is nothing or a first i had put the path.get..

10366704
for-loop	loops
a list comprehension is significantly faster than a normal for-loop as it s implemented c-side in python rather than as a python loops

10366713
int	chars
you cannot pass a chars to printf expecting an int

10366834
postgresql	mysql
let say i ve a table in my database like this be it in postgresql or mysql -

10366897
post	put	post	get	put	get
--it has explicit relationship with http methods namely get post put delete

10366901
post	get
you can get the users who liked a post link image etc using the fql like table but there s nothing about the ordering of the results you get you can check or assume if they are ordered by time

10366911
int	chars
thus x will point to sizeof int bytes in which the lowest is 0x35 the chars 5 the next is 0 and the rest are indeterminate and will lead to undefined behavior when read

10366915
postgresql	mysql
i come from the mysql side but i think the following should also work in postgresql

10366941
submit	submission
so this function is bind to the form submit click event and is run upon submission

10366962
postgresql	mysql
i am not familiar with the details of the syntax for mysql or postgresql but to me it looks like a set of if statements something like

10367003
postgresql	mysql
i use sql server and not mysql or postgresql but i think this ansi sql compliant

10367072
exponent	modulo
i have a file with the public exponent and modulo in it

10367072
exponent	modulo
this isn t a one-time thing either i need to be able to read the public exponent and modulo from files in this format to check the signature

10367078
profiler	vtune
take a look at at intel vtune amplifier xe formerly â intel thread profiler to see if it will meet your needs

10367134
post	get
when facebook post into the iframe with your app url and a signed request there are two options the easy one being that the user is already authenticated and then the signed request will have all the necessary data including a signed request then you just load the canvas page and use the js sdk to get an access token there as well but in this case there s no need to use the fb.login since it opens a popup and will automatically close it you can use the fb.getloginstatus method which won t annoy the user

10367140
google-chrome	firefox
it s worse in google-chrome than in firefox but firefox still isn t completely smooth

10367145
width	height
otherwise i would suggest getting the height and width of the textview at run time if it is below a certain threshold then set the textsize to a smaller value

10367146
getter	setter
they are actually a pair of methods getter and setter with special syntax

10367146
getter	setter
in both cases you usually have a private backing field inside your class which holds the value manipulated by the getter setter subscribe unsubscribe methods

10367146
accessor	properties
and there s an auto-implemented syntax for both properties and events where the compiler generates the backing field and accessor methods for you

10367148
profiler	vtune
take a look at at intel vtune amplifier xe formerly â intel thread profiler to see if it will meet your needs

10367174
post	get
you can get the default button style here and then see this post on how to set the style programmatically

10367211
textview	imageview
i trying to set visibility of my imageview button and textview

10367211
textview	imageview
i tried the view.gone but that just remove all the textview imageview and button

10367211
hide	show
but i just want to hide and then show

10367243
accessor	properties
just like a properties is an accessor for a field

10367243
accessor	properties
like a properties has a get and set accessor an event has the add and remove accessor

10367243
accessor	properties
it does behave somewhat different from a properties if you don t write the add and remove accessor yourself then the compiler auto-generates them

10367256
visualvm	yourkit
yes there are memory profilers such as visualvm and yourkit

10367264
try-catch	exception-handling
i handled exception-handling using try-catch .

10367300
implements	extends
it looks as though you are trying to mimic the generated rpc code where a async rpc interface would be implements by code that extends from com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.impl.remoteserviceproxy which implements serializationstreamfactory

10367300
serializable	deserialization
remember when building your own serializable deserialization mechanism that you need to decide which types can be marshalled within this system - if you open it to all types then you will need to generate fieldserializer types for all possible objects on the source path

10367306
hash	md5
you just need any hash function let s take md5 and a way to commutatively join things

10367306
hash	md5
for example if i choose md5 and addition then i could md5 each digit and add the resulting hash

10367352
folder	directory
it does leave folder in the working directory but since it does overwrite attributes correctly on the initial folder on the move back it s satisfactory and in the end i can just rm the empty remaining directory

10367422
treemap	treeset
this suggests that obj is null at that line and that you are maybe adding some null object to the treeset within the treemap i d imagine

10367448
hash	salt
when storing passwords it s been said that salt doesn t need to be secret and it s only purpose is to keep all hash unique

10367448
hash	salt
we store hash on server a and store salt on server b

10367458
dlsym	dlopen
you can get into issues with dynamic loading dlsym plus dlopen etc to get the new symbols

10367476
int	chars
i am trying to put an unsigned int into a chars buffer and then fetch it back into another unsigned int

10367520
hash	salt
salt doesn t need to be secret and it s only purpose is to keep all hash unique

10367520
hash	salt
it also makes it slower to brute-force a table of hash since you need a try per row for every hash + salt combination instead of just trying out one hash for the whole table select from passwords where hash xxx

10367524
put	get
if autopair minor mode is enabled when you insert a it automatically inserts a there are some exceptions where it doesn t for example if you insert it after a but i like the exceptions and put the cursor between them so you have now if you type a+b you get a+b and not a+b

10367529
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2	scrypt	salt
use an existing one like pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt which have advantages over simple salt hash since they use more cpu time all three and or memory the latter two which makes parallelization expensive

10367529
hash	salt
the salt in a hash protects only against rainbow tables not against brute-force attacks

10367529
hash	salt
the purpose of a salt is to avoid an inexpensive creation of rainbow tables that is instead of just calculating the hash of every probable password and comparing them to your database an attacker has to do this for every different salt

10367535
hash	salt
your salt passwords still begin with actual password data which typically looks very much unlike hash

10367538
inherited	subclassing
i would like to create a subclassing which inherited these methods

10367555
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
two points first of all a uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller so you could create an instance of uinavigationcontroller whose rootviewcontroller is your tableviewcontroller and have the tabbarcontroller manage the nav controller as one of its tabs

10367591
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
should display well in latest version in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

10367647
jobs	cron
i think for reading page walls you need an access token at any cost and realizing an automatic crawler via an application therefore is not possible i guess as apps only react to users actions and cannot act like cron jobs for example

10367678
folder	directory
added ... zeromq-2.2.0 include folder to c c++ general additional include directory

10367684

you can shift only members of that arrays a chars or an int

10367730
openbsd	linux
otherwise if you already have a proxy server you can use the solution above by placing a router or a server running the routing software between the access point and your network for example vyatta or mikrotik routeros commercial but pretty powerful some open-source freeware router firewall distribution pfsense openwall m0n0wall ... or even a vanilla openbsd with pf firewall linux with iptables to achieve the desired effect

10367739

int	chars
that means no chars set conversion no handling of int or floats in binary or ascii representation no dealing with byte orders or any of that

10369776
jstl	taglib
however you re going the wrong path by avoiding taglib like jstl

10369797
super	implements
either implements an empty constructor in the super class or call the parameterized constructor explicitly

10369798
superclass	subclassing
in the subclassing if you don t invoke a superclass constructor explicitly there must be a default superclass constructor that the vm can invoke for you

10369798
superclass	subclassing
then in the subclassing you didn t explicitly invoke a constructor in the superclass

10369801
filtering	grouping
you could almost certainly benefit from binding c-x c-b to ibuffer and using filtering and or grouping to separate out the temporary buffers from the more important ones

10369818
mouse	keyboard
you want that because you want to be able to easily distinguish between these exceptions and hardware interrupts coming from the timer and the real-time clock the keyboard and the mouse the disks and i o ports serial and parallel

10369820
width	height
you do not have access to the object to get the height or width information

10369820
width	height
this codeproject article is an example on how to you could just add another intializer to set the width and height of the inputbox

10369820
width	height
inputbox prompt title defaultresponse xpos ypos width height

10369837
rss	feed
i am parsing a poorly structured rss feed and some of the data that is being returned has in it

10369897
width	height

10369897
width	height
you can just define the width and height properties when you instantiate your object

10369897
children	parent
container layout aka layout organizes the html elements in their parent container and manages the size of its children items items is just the property name the ext js framework uses for the list of objects you add to a container

also check out the various nsstring uikit additions that can be used to get the size of the control necessary to fit your text and programmatically adjust the size the frame your uilabel accordingly

10369970
superclass	subclassing
because then subclassing of the class would erroneously call the superclass calculator s method instead of a possibly overridden method

10369974
subtract	add
such a filter allows the compensation of the wraparound of the angle value because we can add or subtract 360 to diff so as to ensure that abs diff 180 which in turn ensures that the filtered angle value will always increase decrease in the optimal direction to reach its setpoint

10369985
jobs	cron
cron jobs has a minimum interval of a minute

there are quite a few post on this similar question but still i cannot get a clear answer for my code which is for php and mysql combination

10370253
post	get
actually i believed that i used .ajax to send some simple get or post request before but ended up using xhr for some other reasons

10370306
fadein	hide
for specific brand names hide all productcontainers unconditionally then selectively fadein those that meet the criterion

10370316
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
i suggest you to have look at thymeleaf as a template engine combined with either mere jquery or as you say you consider it a bit too simple jquery + backbone.js which is a javascriptmvc framework

10370323
width	font-size	google-chrome	firefox	fontfamily	font-size	letter-spacing	fontfamily	letter-spacing	font-size
fontfamily font-size font-weight line-height text-decoration and letter-spacing but looking at my text in firefox and google-chrome i see a difference in the width of a given text

10370337
goto	break
break is used to goto the end of switch thus completing execution of the switch statement

10370386
int	double
short answer java can automatically widen int s and long s to both float s and double s but java will choose to widen to a float because it is smaller in terms of memory footprint than a double

10370386
int	double
byte to short int long float or double

10370386
int	double
short to int long float or double

10370386
int	double	int	chars
chars to int long float or double

10370386
int	double
int to long float or double

10370386
int	double
widening an int or long value to a float or of a long value to a double may result in a loss of precision

10370386
int	double
an int can be widened to a float and a double but a float 4 bytes is smaller than a double 8 bytes so java will choose to call m float

10370398
midi	osc
you could use clojure to generate midi or osc events and use these to control synthisizers in logic

10370402
udp	tcp
this protocol would enable connections between a usually mobile device and some sort of proxy server which would relay regular tcp udp connections on behalf of the mobile device over this tolerant protocol

10370444
put	get
until you get more confident with java i would recommend that you put each of your classes into a separate file

10370450

10370486
for-loop	loops
32 in the for loops and 32 inside the for-loop

10370486
for-loop	loops
if you cannot get rid of the 32 inside the for-loop the best you can do is loops unrolling to reduce the number of conditional statements being executed by the forloops

10370544
versioning	upgrade
consequence neither party could upgrade to a new versioning of sql server unless the other party also upgrade on the same day

10370544
implements	extends
further as o connor also mentioned xml makes it relatively painless to extends the message contents as requirements change without everyone having to implements the change simultaneously

10370564
post	get
another thing that you can do is to save each published action in your db on each action post you should get an id back from facebook just persist that and then you can easily filter the published actions according to what ever criteria you want need since you are no longer restricted by the facebook api

10370596
g++	gcc
i have compiled imp-1 and imp-2 by using gcc and g++ in linux respectively

10370599
inherited	properties
for example if you do not have a default value defined in the employee class and it inherited from another class like employee for example but the employee constructor sets that properties it ll take the value defined in the super class base class or parent class constructor when you encode the data

10370599
getter	setter
they added auto getter and setter in ext js 4

10370633
subtraction	addition
you can only do pointer arithmetics on pointers that actually point into an array and the result of the addition or subtraction must still point inside the array or one past its end if you don t intend to dereference it

10370650
gradle	ivy
gradle currently does not supports maven s release which is rarely used and deprecated but it does support ivy s latest.release

it s different in firefox google-chrome and ie

10370826
g++	gcc
it seems that your gcc is a 64 bit compiler where as g++ is a 32 bit compiler

10370890
letter-spacing	word-spacing
i would use the word-spacing property and not the letter-spacing

10370900
children	parent
as i understood from your question you want to access children class members from object of parent class

10370945
int	chars
i have a chars but when i run a check to see if it is nil i get an exception comparison between pointer and int

10370952
int	chars
chars are usually 8-bit int values while nil is a pointer

10370970
modulus	fractions
note that you could easily optimize this to run in a fractions of the time by making more use of the modulus operator and by not computing the number of sundays on other days of the month since you throw them away anyway in the end

10370998
portrait	landscape
at that point my code is fliping inbetween landscape and portrait

10371022

post	get
i want to develop my own c compiler to get deeper into flex and bison for my compiler lessons at university but i can t find flex and bison which i ve seen described in some other post

10371287
min	max
so two users could run the sproc that has this code and so detect at the same time that l_low is null and then both try and insert into nasd_stats at the same time after the min max aggregation one of which would fail as there is a unique key on nasd_stats based on symbol_id

10371292

accessor	properties
here i ve given you example of how you could make use of properties accessor to dynamically generate your relevant rectangles

10371423
mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
you could use mousemove event instead of mouseenter and mouseleave and use image dimensions to determine if mouse is over the image

10371429
soundpool	audiotrack
for audio there s a hard limit of 32 active audiotrack objects per device not per app you need to share those 32 with rest of the system and audiotrack is used internally beneath soundpool tonegenerator mediaplayer native audio based on opensl es etc

10371820
istream	getline
for example you could read the entire line using getline and then put that line into a stringstream and read from that in a while-loop - or you could use the peek method of the istream class after reading each value to check whether the next character in the stream is a newline

10371853
width	height
i want the cell to have fixed width and height and if text is longer - ellipsis ... will appear

put	get
so a part of my homework is to get a string of integer numbers and put each one of them in a list this is what i have done

10371941
for-loop	arrays
so what i ve done is take the string split it into an arrays and then take the items with the for-loop and put them into a list

ubuntu	linux
to be specific linux ubuntu 9.10

jobs	cron
we have two cron jobs that hit two different dynamic backends and both are having the same problem

10372425
ssl	https
whilst https does secure the secret key from being intercepted by a packet sniffer it does not prevent it being intercepted by a transparent proxy that presents an ssl certificate which is accepted by the phone such as a self-signed one that has been added to its keychain

10372425
hash	salt
to defeat threats of this sort i suggest that you calculate a secure hash of data + random salt value + secretkey and send data that same salt value that hash to the server

10372436
fseek	fgetc	fgets	fgetc	fgets	fseek
you should never use fgets fgetc to check something without rewinding back with fseek or undoing with ungetc because every file read function will consume data from file current position in file will be incremented

10372724
mouse	keyboard
edit i thought i d mention that i m just looking for a method for my code to control mouse and keyboard

10377572
stdout	stderr
the elisp facilities for running asynchronous processes do not provide good support to distinguish the stderr from the stdout output so currently comint does not let you distinguish the two

10377592
width	height
it works fine just some time it fires width and height zero value

10377592
width	height
do you guys have any idea why returns zero to its width height

10377600
int	double
note that you have to cast the object returned to a numeric wrapper class not a primitive class thus double not double and int not int

10377606
int	double
if the dynamic type returned by stonesspinnerimperial.getmodel .getvalue is an int and you try to cast it to a double you ll get a classcastexception

10377606
int	double
use the constructor that accepts double or restrict your computations to int arithmetic

10377608
toolchain	binutils

10377746
getter	setter
i think you have to create getter and setter for your textbox so it will be exposed as part of your form class and you can access it as a form object

10377774

you should show the code at line 22 of announce.java so we can see what specifically you are doing wrong but either copying your list before starting loops using a for-loop instead of an iterator or saving the items you want to remove from the list to a new list and then removing them en-masse after completing the iterator loops would work

its because your view is custom view and root of all layouts views such as linaerlayout relative layout table layout absolute layout .so chicld iew linear layout in your case cannot put constraint on view and your custom view here has not till now decided yet its width and height but if you make it custom in some class and give its width and height in onmeasure then at runtime button will come below of it

see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

10380892

as i understand this is because pdf uses as default and thus respects width and height which does not give a perfect square since we have axis labels

superclass	subclassing
you cannot directly access the private members of a superclass from a subclassing

10383549

is it semantically correct and a matter of best practice when writing oo programs to access field values with getter and then create new objects based upon the modified values rather than using setter methods to simply adjust the field of that object

10383786
class-method	delegation
however often it s better to delegation use cases like these to other class-method which are more explicit about what they do for example foo.relating_to bar

10383808
hash	md5
since you want the number yes a md5 hash is nothing but a base16 number we can of course convert that to base-something to shorten the string to be pronouncable over the phone i suggest avoiding mixed upper- lowercase

10383841

min	max
depending on your needs you have several solutions for instance you can simply reset the min and max from time to time like dirkgently suggested

10384414
min	max	range	min	range	max
if you want a moving range so that at any point in time you have the min and max of the n last measurements then you will have to use a more complex solution

10384418
min	max
it seems you only want a recent max min value so you could do something like the following

10384418
min	max
this tracks the age in samples of the min and the max values and when they exceed a predetermined threshold 1000 samples in the above case they expire and get replaced by more recent min max values

min	max
after a little algebra that becomes max q min 1-q

10384973
min	max
so plugging uniformly distributed values ranging from 0 to 1 such as you d get from nextdouble into this function will give you values with a and ranging from the given min to max

10384973
min	max
one more point you could of course set min to double.min_value and max to double.max_value but i don t know enough about floating point representations to know if that would be problematic and if it is then i don t know how small large a number would need to be to become so

10385002

now i found the webkit stylesheet for firefox but i cannot get one for ie and since ie css styling differs a lot from google-chrome and firefox editing the firefox stylesheet for ie might just take a lot of time and effort and also there are some styles in the firefox webkit css file that are not supported by ie such as border-image so it is not that i m just lazy

10385804
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

10386319
qkeysequence	qkeyevent
qkeyevent represents the event of a single key press or release whereas a qkeysequence can contain a sequence of up to four keys each with optional modifier information

10386319
qkeysequence	qkeyevent
you can even write a conversion function for qkeyevent to qkeysequence

10386319
qkeysequence	qkeyevent	qevent	qkeyevent
note that it does not make sense to convert a qkeysequence to a qkeyevent though since you have to choose a specific event type such as qevent keypress or qevent keyrelease

10386323
width	height
it only allows 100 width and a fixed height

10386332

10386702
ostringstream	std	std	ostream	ostream	ostringstream
edit since every response seems to want to put it there i can not use std ostream because i want this to work only for std ostringstream and std basic_ostringstream and not for any type of output stream

10386715
google-chrome	firefox
i was getting the same error in google-chrome and different one in firefox ie

10386778
ostringstream	std	std	ostream	ostream	ostringstream
the real problem with your code is that you ve overloaded std ostringstream rather than std ostream

10386778
std	ostream
so the solution is to overload std ostream instead of std basic_ostringstream

10386786
entity-relationship	diagram
there are tools that generate entity-relationship diagram for a given database

10386802
createfile	deviceiocontrol

the above code is properly loading video only but if i provide small height and width 100 the uiwebview is loaded with the whole page video + comments and all

junit	testng
i suspect what you re trying to do will be easy with testng - junit does not have the grouping capability that testng does

10387737

10390185
free	malloc
second you could continue to use c-style raw blocks of memory but work with pointers instead of arrays throughout and allocate them explicitly with new and delete or with malloc and free and be careful that everything gets free exactly once

10390188
client-side	server-side
this method sets up a catchall between your client-side scripts and the remote domain you are trying to access as curl or any other server-side http lib is not bound by cross-domain policy

10395681
vala	genie
like vala genie has the same advantages

bionic	libc
thus the libc contained in the ndk is bionic as is the libc available on android devices

10395889

hash	md5
a possible issue is that you are running jdk 7 and that shows the sha1 hash as default instead of an md5 hash the thread below could help you in that case

10396300
width	height
basically you always have a container element that contains the image and i assume this container has a width height set

10396303
post	put
for that you can either update some table in db or just put a file with post data content on your local drive and dump as a file with timestamp

10396356

accessor functions to the properties

10397276
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

10397331

the password should be protected by hashing with a strong salt either md5 or sha1 are fine to prevent attack using rainbow tables

10397338
typedef	typename
it only seems to fail and require a typename keywords iff the dependent name is a typedef

10397339

10397404
hash	salt
as for the passwords they should absolutely be encrypted or hash preferably with salt too

10397440
gmail	hotmail
then depending on whether i choose to send via gmail or hotmail i get different results

10397468
put	get
the routing is working to the index method because i can eg put in a redirect and it gets acted upon but i cannot get the template to display

10397474

10397726
toolchain	bionic	bionic	glibc
if you are going to use glibc instead of bionic it may be worth looking into using the toolchain of a compatible kernel generation arm-linux distro rather than the ndk

10397726
toolchain	bionic	bionic	libc
for a jni sub which remains the only officially endorsed vehicle for native application code it could get a bit interesting with either toolchain as you will be running in a process that has already mapped and is making ongoing use of the bionic libc to support the dalvik vm

10397792
integer	unsigned
so putting c++ portability aside and just being practical if you are in a 32-bit architecture then an unsigned int should be fine and in a 64-bit an unsigned long that is an integer long enough to hold the value of a pointer

10397799
getter	setter
note that you have to use getter and setter with interfaces because you can t use them to define vanilla variables

10397802
freemarker	velocity
so for example in the spring mvc framework the m is whatever your business logic is the v is whichever templating language you decide to use freemarker jsp jstl velocity and the c is the dispatcherservlet which selects the controller implementation

convert double into string instead of int

10398151
getter	setter
i a prefer similar to your method but using a private static property key value array with a getter and setter

10398165
hide	show
html css media queries and jquery all play a part to expand the ui and manipulate show hide content elements as the browser gets bigger

10398179
int	double
just remember that a conversion like yours will cause an overflow since double holds 2 words 8 bytes and int only 2 4 bytes

10398944
int	double
this is confusing but d is the format for an int like i most people expect it to be for double since f is for float but it s not

10398975
int	double
in the first case printf extects a double due to the f but you pass an int

10398975
int	double
the format of double is different form int see ieee-754 for most-used double format

10398975
int	double
the second is similar printf expects an int due to d but you pass in a double

10399263
width	height
show animates width and height from zero to their natural values which may be messing with your margins

10399266

10399544
for-loop	loops
for years i ve gotten in to the habit of not using the value of a for-loop iterator after loops exits

10399547

10399876
floating-point	fractions
observe that each of these hexadecimal floating-point constants has exactly 53 bits in its significand the fractions part often inaccurately called the mantissa

10399876
range	infinity
floating-point significands are always scaled to start with 1 except for special cases zero infinity and very small numbers at the bottom of the representable range so we adjust this to 0x1.00000000000004p0

10399903
trie	tree

folder	directory
simply do a svn log and then when you see that a directory got renamed in a particular release do a svn ls --recurse on that folder and get all the files in it

10399941
for-loop	loops
even though the value of that for-loop s control variable is well defined you might have been told to avoid using the for-loop s control variable after the for-loop because of the way scoping of that variable is handled and especially because the handling has changed of the history of c++ i know this question is tagged c but i think the rationale for avoiding using for-loop control variable after loops may have origins in this c++ history

10399956
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
the margin top and left has to be negative half the height and width of the element

10399956

floating-point	integer
as you note ieee-754 does not specify what happens when you convert a floating-point nan to an integer except that it should raise an invalid operation exception which your compiler probably ignores

10400095
floating-point	integer
intel specifies instruction behavior very carefully and the behavior for converting a floating-point nan to a 32-bit integer is to return 0x80000000 regardless of the payload of the nan which is what you observed

10403526
cpu	hyperthreading
turn of hyperthreading in the bios and you will see 100 cpu

10403544

instead of making 48 if statements is there a way i could alter the variable name of the coords arrays to put it in a for-loop with a counter incrementing the name of the arrays

10403572
touchesbegan	touchesended
the default behavior of the touch handling methods touchesbegan touchesended etc. have this note in the documentation

this one works better because it supports classes who extends or implements

10403705
int	double
some of the attributes are int double and strings

10403713
free	calloc
this array of pointers to strings with const content is itself allocated dynamically with calloc and i free it before the function returns after the c-strings have been processed

10403739
put	get
if i just put something like this in config environments production.rb i get an unknown constant error

10403814
tablelayout	margins
just include the tablelayout in a linearlayout and the latter will correctly add the margins

10403825
google-chrome	firefox
here is a quick example using jquery quickly tested in firefox 11 google-chrome

10404098
rss	feed
i need to take a few rss feed and archive all the items that get added to them

10404098
rss	feed
i know i can t rely on the feed server to provide a complete history is it possible to get rss archive

10404098
rss	feed
i know i ll have to have some custom logic around duplicates how to check uniqueness non duplication of a post in an rss feed

10404151
width	height
and the same can be done to center along the x-axis replacing height with width

10404153
rss	feed
it depends on the feed some sites publish articles very frequently and may have their rss feed configured to show only the 10 most recent articles

10404164
oncreate	onstart
activity b s oncreate onstart and onresume methods execute in sequence

10404234
prepare	execute
you did not post the code which handles the database interaction how query is built and execute but if you prepare the string your data should be inserted updated in it s entirety as expected

10404246
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
also both setinterval and settimeout return a reference which can be used to stop them using clearinterval ref or cleartimeout ref

10404253
post	get
the method attribute of the submission must be set to get or post in order to access the soap http binding

10404267

10404366
pecl	pear
assuming the hosting you are using with go daddy is the linux 4gh hosting pear and pecl should already be installed and available for use

10404402
implements	extends
so even though bmiperson extends person it can still be implements so as to contain another person inside it -- a decorator

10404409
apache	nginx
one of the reasons is that most production sites run nginx anyway so this way i m closer to what my server actually uses unless you are on shared-hosting which still uses the apache

10404442
width	height
jquery dialog height width issue

10404442
width	height
just use the minheight and minwidth instead of height width attributes of the jquery dialog method

10404468
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
i was testing over apache nginx and lighttpd

10404468

google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox google-chrome ie9 but not ie8 have not tested it on 7 6 but guessing it wont work there either

10404661
mouseleave	mouseenter
the idea here is to trigger manually the display of popover with mouseenter mouseleave events

10404746
put	get
so these i ve either hard-coded in the makefile or if they require some detection put the detection logic in configure but passed them through a separate make variable instead of cflags so they won t get overridden

10404764
versioning	upgrade
you simply need to upgrade the local versioning 2008 express to r2

10404840
bitblt	gdi
you could try using gdi to bitblt from the screen s dc to a memory dc as most screen capture programs do but that s not guaranteed to work

10404862
postgresql	mysql
postgresql not sure about mysql has a character limit on constraint names so when using add_index for multiple columns make sure you re either giving a custom name or that your column names are short enough to fit under the limit because otherwise the auto-generated index_users_on_col1_and_col2_and_col3 could screw things up for you

10404933
sorting	filtering
while working on a large list of tabular data that needs an easy sorting filtering system i discovered the isotope library which seems to do exactly what i want and provides a lot of nice visuals and functionality

10404933

https ssl has nothing to do with django as such you must set apache configuration correctly using mod_ssl see

10405090
textmate	sublimetext
textmate snippets and themes port over nicely to sublimetext

10405136
uilabel	uitextview
to my knowledge text isn t an animateable property for any object uilabel uitextview etc. but there are a number of controls available that subclass these objects and allow animateable text among other properties

10405148
post	get
however on win7 it returns json from both get an post requests

10405148
post	get
on windows 2003 server it returns xml from get and json from post

sudoers	passwd
i don t have the root passwd to login to the machine nor am i a sudoers but i do have a root principle in kerberos

10405210
tarfile	zipfile
however i am having trouble figuring out how to build this sort of thing around the zipfile or tarfile libraries and i m afraid they may not support reading files as they go or reading the archive as it is built

10405212
width	height
obviously in your case you would specify the size you want explicitly instead of trying to get the intrinsic height width of the drawable

10405224
for-loop	loops
for-loop condition should be correct to ensure it loops the right

10405231
range	minimum
i ve tried taking the minimum of the distance and range - distance but i think due to the way i ve structured the program this is giving weird output

10405231
distance	pdist
currently finding euclidean distance with numpy.linalg.norm though there are scipy pdist routines that do the same thing that i might use i guess

10405275
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
to build a second gridview or listview or repeater to show that information

10405280
viewdidappear	viewwillappear

10405291
post	get
they say that i need to submit a http post request but i must also submit some configurations via an http get also

10405291
post	get
httpwebrequest with post and get at the same time

10405304
submit	submission
validate automatically with xmlhttprequest or something similarly working so on submit click js accesses php file validates returns the result and allows submission of data

10405355
width	height
depending on how many views you want to change the layouts on i think it s better to create a helper method and pass whatever views you want to change to the method along with the height and width values you want them to change to

10405355
width	height
remember that setting the width and height here are not going to match the same values in your xml android layout_width 32dp is not the same as lp.width 32

10405361
turkish	polish
handles latin characters as well as greek turkish russian ukrainian czech polish and latvian

10405365
superclass	subclassing
browsing back and forth using open declaration f3 and the back button alt+left can get confusing i start loosing focus and happen to mistakenly read a superclass s method implementation that actually gets overridden by the subclassing i investigate

10405392
for-loop	loops
just for simplicity i ll point out that a for-loop that has only two iterations and one line of code inside loops is kind of a waste of typing

10405405
turkish	polish
handles latin characters as well as greek turkish russian ukrainian czech polish and latvian

10405418
nsstring	nsdata
network layer same applies as described above in the end you ll get an nsdictionary of headers and some nsdata or nsstring of content

10405440
rank	percentile
only other way i can think of is to ditch the comparison of the lev_distance to either string lenghts but instead present the comparitive distances of the top n matches as an inverse percentile rank 100-percentile-rank

10405452
turkish	polish
handles latin characters as well as greek turkish russian ukrainian czech polish and latvian

10405465

10405586
width	height
the actual link in question did not have the comma between the width and height

10405629
nsstring	nsdata
but depending on what you re doing you might want to look into nsstring or nsdata the cocoa classes for dealing with text and binary data respectively

10405764
width	height
onclick window.open media-player.html player scrollbars 0 width 360 height 655

10405768
put	get
you already have so you can probably get the right row from that and put it in a variable then access it in the callback to put the result in the right place

10405782
floating-point	fixed-point
also until recently we didn t actually use floating-point numbers for time but fixed-point microsecond counters

10405833
integer	unsigned
the unsigned right shift doesn t exist in c++ because it s not necessary -- c++ has distinct signed and unsigned integer types

10405852
google-chrome	safari
i m facing same issue but i have not done any mods so i think it s facebook fault as this is very straightforward just copy from fb and paste in your site and it works in ie google-chrome and safari so far i ve tried

10405858
profiling	instrumentation
you could use instrumentation included in xcode with the time profiling to monitor your app s launch

10405875
hide	show
alternatively keep both itemscontrols in your xaml and conditionally hide show them using visibility and a booleantovisibilityconverter

10405890
int	double
i tried changing some int to double but ultimately ended up with this being the closest i ever got to the real pattern

10405896
minimum	max
the split view will call your delegate method hoping it can leave the max divider position at the height of the split view passing this in as the second argument but you can simply subtract some quantity from that value say 60 to return it as the minimum height for the bottom view

10405918
integer	fractions
an integer can only hold whole numbers no decimals or fractions

10405924
piston	tastypie
to expose your application s api you can use tastypie piston or djangorestframework

maven	m2e
for whatever reason and i m sure it s a perfectly good one the m2e plugin authors didn t provide a run maven package hook

10405994
hide	show
i have seen examples to hide or show columns but i need really to remove them so then when i get the 2-dimensional matrix of data i don t have crossed references nor bad data

10406017
width	height
thus doubling the scale factor doubles the width and height of the resulting renderbuffer giving you more pixels for your content

10406063
int	double
i use it because c c++ mixes bool type with int long pointer double etc...together

10406096
listview	gridview
i ve got a listview and in the listview i have a gridview

10406100
pop-up	dialog
looking to catch the click eventfrom this anchor embedded within a div....the anchor actually calls a modal dialog form and i need to supress that call so the pop-up doesn t come up

10406122
put	get
excuse the messy code the only way i could get it to work was to put the javascirpt in the html box

10406163
put	get
i ve looked everywhere but i can t get how to have gridview put the sql server db content in that textbox on page_load one textbox + for each row

10406210
hide	show
you should add both select_tag and text_field_tag in your template then hide and show them using javascript

10406224
setinterval	settimeout
edit simply change setinterval ... to settimeout ahitrate 5000

10406240
google-chrome	firefox
you can bring up the console with ctrl+shift+j using google-chrome or by installing the firebug extension under firefox

10406251
width	height
if it s a radius then the height and width paramters should each be 2 circle_size rather than circle_size

10406267
memcpy	strcpy
i guess you meant to use strcpy or memcpy

10406278
switching	screens
this will let you create different screens and you or the user can switching between them easily

10406289
qsort	bsearch
of course you ve already sorted the array with qsort before you use bsearch on it mdash

10406292
width	height
set a minimum width or height on the parent

10406317
getter	setter
write a class that holds a day and a temperature make the attributes public or use getter and setter

10406339
popupwindow	pop-up
the view under popupwindow has to consume the touches outside the pop-up properly

10406347
integer	unsigned
arc4random returns a u_int32_t -- that s an unsigned integer one that doesn t represent negative values

10406347
subtraction	modulo
to promote the result of the modulo before the subtraction and everything will be okay

10406388
queue	fifo
amazon sqs has just gained fifo queue with exactly-once processing deduplication

for fifo fifo queue

10406388
queue	fifo
as emphasized these new fifo sqs queue will cover the use case at hand but are not yet available in all sqs regions initially only in us east ohio and us west oregon

10406388
queue	fifo
also the sqs faq for fifo queue outlines notable differences between standard and fifo queue that should be considered upfront for example a throughput limit of 300 transactions per second

10406388
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i ve only tested it shortly myself so far but have been pretty pleased with the offered features and language integrations see client libraries and beanstalk support - given their competitive price tag and especially the free tier makes it a good candidate for exploring a message queuing as a service solution not the least in combination with their second product ironworker an easy-to-use and massively scalable task queue ... which provides functionality not even available from amazon-web-services as of today

10406404
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
one reasonably easy solution is to use the objectoutputstream and objectinputstream classes to write and read your arrays

10406434
post	get
i m guessing this is due to the admin.site.unregister post line but if i don t use that i get the error the model post is already registered. if instead i remove both that line and the post from admin.site.register post postadmin i get the error mediadefiningclass object is not iterable

10406450

i am currently working on a webpage and i have achieved fitting it in the whole browser window by using percentage values in the width and height properties of my css

10406636
jsf	seam
i m in the process of migrating our primary application from seam 2.2 to seam 2.3beta1 in order to get some of the benefits of jsf 2.0 and jpa 2.0

10406636
jsf	seam
this works with no problem in seam 2.2 with jsf 1.2

10406643
width	height
you can use the css properties min-width and min-height to set minimum width and height respectively for a block level element like a container

10406647
children	parent
there s menuitem which contains a label an associated function a link to its parent and a vector that contains references to its children

10406695
accessor	properties
the name of your accessor method needs to follow the naming conventions for a properties foo the setter is setfoo note the capitalization

10406706
ubuntu	linux
if possible i would avoid changing default setting in ubuntu linux server postgres server as it tends to cause other side effects

10406725
innodb	myisam
fulltext indexes can only be used with myisam tables currently though soon v5.6+ you can use them with innodb also

10406736
stdout	stderr
i edited my command to add and thereby redirect stderr to stdout and suddenly everything worked as expected

10406739
post	get
for example i try to paste the url for get messages into the browser i get a response with an empty array which is ok because i couldn t post any messages onto a queue

10406778
unsigned	short
but if i comment out the contents of the union so that unsigned short is not used anywhere at all and include this file into swig it still creates swigtype_p_unsigned_short

min	max
but in my exposed filters for min rent and max rent i want it to be a dropdown list of â 100 â 200 â 300 â 400 â 500 etc - incremented

10406825
for-loop	loops
they make sense in languages where for loops stand for repeat until condition changing this each iteration which is not what for loops or for comprehensions are in scala a for comprehension is a for-loop which yields something for each iteration

10406838
post	get
for those who get on same problem follow above post steps

10406851
uitableview	nsindexpath
it s a simple call inside tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

10406867
uiview	subviews
uiview touches do not get passed to subviews if they lie outside of the superview s bounds as mentioned by the solution

10406867
uiview	subviews
use this uiview subclass as the superview so subviews can respond to touches

10406874
put	get
both the methods get called as indicated by the nslogs i have put in both of them but the timer never gets fired and the player continues to play indefinitely

10406945

jquery live deprecated or on works just with click dblclick keydown keypress keyup mousedown mousemove mouseout mouseover and mouseup events

10406949
equals	compareto
originally this answer neglected the fact that a treeset does its comparisons based on compareto rather than equals

10406949
equals	compareto
you need to define equals hashcode and compareto for your player object correctly

10407026
repo	egit
okay this is what s happening -- i go to the install new software page and i ve added the egit repo but the window below doesn t show anything

10407051
textmate	sublimetext
some editors like textmate and sublimetext will allow that

10407067
int	chars
the first column is hashtag and the second is counter which has chars 10 and int properties respectively

10407085
addition	multiplication
the issue is definitely the for-loop not the addition of handling multiplication at the top of the function

10407222
folder	directory
windows searches the same directory as the exe any directory in the path windows or msys directory as well as a few special ones in the windows folder

10407238
put	get
i can already retrieve them manually as long as i have a file name but i would rather just get all of them at once and put them in the documents directory if possible

10407246
move	drag
this does not conflict with the ability to drag and move cells in the edit mode

10407246
uitableview	nsindexpath

google-chrome	firefox
the problem i m having is that google-chrome reports a height of 25px and every other browser ie8 ie9 firefox reports 27px

10407332
put	get
although it s a bit odd if you put a semi-colon after a brace in this kind of scenario it ll get rid of your errors

10407345
accessor	properties
this is only one of the many many many reasons you should never access ivars directly and always use accessor -- especially now that they re essentially written for you automagically by properties synthesize

10407419
min	max
after playing with the min max not sure where my fault is

10407489
width	height
i wouldn t use position absolute instead use position relative as an absolute positioned element has no height or width

10407501
post	get
i m stuck on 6.5 of when trying to validate my blog post and this is the error that i get unknown validator presencesvalidator

10407505
for-loop	loops
i need to have a variable inside my for-loop and then access it outside of loops

10407513
int	boolean	int	double
specifically numeric types int long double etc. are initialized to 0 boolean are initialized to false and reference types are initialized to null

10407522
int	chars
or if you really needs to use getchar and to print it as a chars declare ch as a chars itself and if you need to use it as an int again use the itoa function that transforms a chars to an int

10407523
bmp	png
what about images png jpeg bmp

10407543
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome it just works for firefox you need firebug

10407544
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following fb.login function works fine in desktop google-chrome firefox and safari

10407544
pop-up	dialog
fb.login triggers a pop-up dialog

10407549
post	get
if i select academia law policy full-time part-time early-career i expect to get a post that matches this filtering logic

10407556
for-loop	loops
in java for-loop statement local variables must first initialize and then use in loops block

10407596
post	get
the method is simple just post the value and parse the return value when i run it i get the console output

10407658
post	get
you don t want to see post that do not match the criteria but using left join will mean that many post get selected in this part though all the rows are later discarded by the broken where condition already discussed

10407660
oncreate	recreate
then put the following code inside the loginactivity s oncreate ... to listen for when loginactivity is recreate and the exit signal was passed

10407689
for-loop	arrays
this probably means that each object titles you re retrieving from dict in the last for-loop is not an arrays but in fact another dictionary that your code is simply referring to as an arrays

10407711
int	chars
right now i have the python code taking out all chars and keeping int like so

10407713
catransition	uiswipegesturerecognizer	uipangesturerecognizer	catransition	uipangesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer
if you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that case

10407765
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also use web inspector for google-chrome safari or firebug for firefox to catch some errors in the console

10407769
keydown	keyup
sendmessage for keydown and postmessage for keyup worked for all functions but the reliability rate dropped dramatically as well as adding latency into key events

10407769
keydown	keyup
only a combination of postmessage for keydown and sendmessage for keyup managed to do anything useful with a maybe 5-10 fail rate of keyup registering

10407781
gtk	cairo
it s not intended to have practical value but rather to be relatively simple excercise to get me comfortable with libpcap gtk and cairo before i use them for anything serious

10407781
packets	pcap
it s eventually going to read frames with pcap currently i just have a hardcoded test frame then use cairo to generate pretty pictures using color values generated from the raw packets at this stage i m just using cairo_show_text to print a text representation of the frame or packets

gdk	drawingarea
now i m at the point where i think the widget really needs private storage for things like the cairo_t context pointer and a gdkregion pointer i had not planned to use gdk directly but my research indicates that it may be necessary in order to call gdk_window_invalidate_region to force my drawingarea to refresh once i ve drawn a frame not to mention gdk_cairo_create

10407801
for-loop	arrays
one thing to try would be a regular for-loop with a fixed upper bound rather than one based on the length of the arrays

10407809
gridview	onclientclick
in fillresult.aspx here i want all subject names with textboxes or any other possible way like gridview dalalist etc that are assigned by admin and button onclientclick event to fill the marks.

10407812
maven	m2e
when you want to compile your maven project using m2e plugin try

10407818
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested and it won t work in ie9 and ie8 and i know it works as i want in google-chrome and firefox

10407824
firefox	safari
i tried logging in different browsers sadly there s only safari and firefox here

10407838
strcpy	strncpy
see the manual entries for strcpy and strncpy or strcat and strncat for the differences

10407877
getter	setter
i have read books on java saying that it is good to create setter and getter for variables such as x and y

10407880
post	get
get this far if you have any more questions post them with an example of what you have tried

10407891
public	protected
their visibility can be changed however using either protected or if necessary for some bizarre reason public

10407908
getter	setter
using getter and setter functions allow for constraints and encapsulation

10407925
public	protected
another reason is for accessing fields outside your class you will have to mark them public protected or default and thus you loose control

10407925
getter	setter
you will allow field access as they cannot be changed for instance variable you will place them with getter setter

10407925
getter	setter
but if you carefully design your class with getter and no setter you keep the immutability intact

10407925
getter	setter
we can use the private variables in any package using getter and setter

10407939
getter	setter
i would say that neither the getter setter nor the public members are good object oriented design

10407941
range	minimum
if it is a signed type then its range is at least from -128 to 127 and if it is an unsigned type its range is at least from 0 to 255 these are the range that the type must support at a bare minimum the range supported by the type may actually be larger than this depending on the implementation

10407943
getter	setter
getter and setter encapsulate the fields of a class by making them accessible only through its public methods and keep the values themselves private

10407946
getter	setter
the methods that change a propertiy s value are called setter methods and the methods that retrieve a property s value are called getter methods

10407960
fgets	fread	fgets	fgetc	fgetc	fread
in c you d use the standard fread fgets fgetc etc functions

10408000
getter	setter
getter and setter method are used to get and set the value of x which is the way to achive encapsulation

10408005
gridview	onclientclick
the way i would approach your problem would be to have an onclientclick event for your link button that iterates through the gridview get the data from each text box and then perform the appropriate data base action in the code behind

10408009
getter	setter
one of the best reasons i can think of for getter and setter is the permanence of a class s api

10408009
getter	setter
by providing getter and setter a programmer has the flexibility to modify members and behavior freely as long as the adhere to the contract described by the public api

10408019
portrait	landscape
but if i make zoom-in in portrait mode and then rotationg in landscape webview takes margin from right side

10408023
hash	md5
if you want to assure users that files have not been tampered with you can give them an md5 hash of the file

10408023
hash	md5
they can use free tools to check the md5 hash of a file they downloaded and compare it to the one you ve given to make sure their file was not altered

10408023
hash	md5
this functions almost like getting an md5 hash of a file with a private key known only to you so that the end user can compare the file signature to your public key to ensure the file has not been tampered with and is coming from a specific source

10408066
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

10408070
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have no problem in opera browser but in every other google-chrome ie firefox

10408071
g++	gcc	clang	llvm
xcode includes both clang and gcc built with llvm as clang and gcc g++ respectively

10408083
getter	setter
another good reason to user getter and setter can be understand by the following example

10408083
getter	setter
the point of getter and setter is that only they are meant to be used to access the private varialble which they are getting or setting

10408083
getter	setter
there is no requirement for getter and setter to start with get and set - they are just normal member functions

10408091
folder	directory
you ll need to put that in a folder called oauth2 in the same directory as your html file

10408092
folder	directory
i uploaded my folder to the website directory through ftp and pointed the domain to my rails folder in the control panel but when i go to the website homepage i get you don t have permission to access on this server. i tried using passenger but i m not sure if that is needed or if it worked at all

10408100
getter	setter
originally getter setter pattern was created to promote good object-oriented design by encapsulating the internals of a class from its external interface

10408119
dictionary	map
however the dictionary methods cannot be redefined easily like map and zip .

10408150
cassini	iis
cassini cannot be accessed from another pc so you would have to switch to iis express or iis

10408156
portrait	landscape
but when i manually rotate the simulator then it will go in landscape and portrait mode properly

10408177
jgit	egit
in the indigo release there is the eclipse egit eclipse mylyn to github connector and jgit in indigo r2 release site

10408208
flask	pyramid
pyramid uwsgi pylon flask

10408245
pylons	pyramid
i have been told that pylons is quite good newer pyramid but i personally use django and i m quite happy with it

10408265
button	checkbox
the default responds on a click and if is used with a button checkbox radio etc

10408306
hide	show
i used below code for show hide caption in jquery

10408313
vertica	teradata
i am trying to convert a vertica view definition to teradata

10408408
sharepoint	cqwp
surprisingly content query web part doesn t allow multiple selection in the original list setting as this cqwp was pulling the data from a list available in the sharepoint site for the value field

10408427
filtering	grouping
you would probably want to do a filtering or grouping by on the patient_id and the datepart test_date_time in your recordset to make sure you don t step into other patients days in your iteration

10408442
caliburn.micro	prism
we did some comparisons on mvvm libraries mvvm light caliburn.micro prism etc and we will choose mmvm light because it seems to offer a huge userbase lots of functionality and updates plus a gentle learning curve

10408506
http	spdy
http pipelining is susceptible to head of line blocking at the http transaction level whereas spdy only has head of line blocking at the transport level due to its use of multiplexing

10408506
ssl	spdy
spdy as deployed in the wild does not have this problem since it is generally deployed over ssl port 443 using npn to negotiate spdy support

10408506
http	spdy
i could go on and on about http pipelining vs spdy

10408507
post	get
my idea is simply to point them all to mysite.com and somehow get the subdomain name with php so that i echo the city post and content with php

10408510
post	get
i want to get the an app access token and then post as the page to the page

10408510
put	get
i put this id into and i get a valid response

10408513
post	get
i would like to know is there any way to send a message to a friend in facebook from an android app. not wall post .googled a lot about this topic but didn t get any proper solution.guide me to some reference or blog

10408553
jar	war
i ve tried copying the mailcap from the jar file into the meta-inf directory of the exploded war

10408553
ubuntu	linux
linux - the versions that come with ubuntu 10.04 lts - i ll check these later and add

10408553
content-length	content-type
.net4.0e accept-encoding gzip deflate bulletin_type am to julian.cable yahoo.com cc admin localhost breadcrumbid id-b1-l0n336601-58958-1335935026761-0-2 camelhttpurl content-length 24896 referer from jfbcable gmail.com accept image jpeg application x-ms-application image gif application xaml+xml image pjpeg application x-ms-xbap application vnd.ms-excel application vnd.ms-powerpoint application msword accept-language en-gb content-type multipart form-data

10408566
hide	show
once scrolled to the bottom of the page it show all and immediately slices to 40 and then hide again the rest again

10408577
jar	war
seems that the jar file for the jdbc connectivity is missing from the war file that you have deployed

10408606
google-chrome	safari
however even if my game now compiles in .air and works fine it works terribly slower than directly in ie9 google-chrome or safari

10408612
mouse	keyboard
provided fiddle select correctly the items with mouse but if i someone download the code and run the provided example then it works fine with keyboard keys but with mouse only last one can be selected

10408642
ienumerable	iqueryable
it can expose collections of model objects using iqueryable ienumerable but there are no primary key foreign key navigation properties customer.invoices to use once the entities are loaded on the client because there is no data context which loads them asynchronously or in one call using expand and manages the changes

10408660
ssl	https
1 is ssl https or ftps

10408840
super	implements
if an object do not support clone it throws clonenotsupportedexception this means that if you try to clone a super object and you get the exception you can t implements the clone object also in your subtype and the object cannot be cloned .

10408844
button	checkbox
for example when i clicked on checkbox i want text to be selecting... and after click the button to see text loading...

10408859
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
with the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes

10408912
decltype	auto
there is also a bunch of post-c++11 features like decltype auto member initializers and aggregates that are supported by clang 3.3

10408966
junit	testng
my suggestion would be to try to use a testing framework testng or junit which gives many more features than just parametrization

10408975
stateless	stateful
yes http protocol is essentially a stateless protocol but to make it stateful we make use of http cookies

10408990
children	parent
you use a layout that allows the children to be placed relative to others like a relativelayout instead of the parent linearlayout with the id centerlayout

10409022
free	malloc
why i use top in linux to show my memory of one process i get that the storage of the process do only increase and do not decrease except i close the all process.i don t know why though i use free only behind malloc

10409032
math.h	sqrt
is sqrt not in the math.h header file

10409053
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
ubuntu manpage malloc free calloc realloc - allocate and free dynamic memory

10409059
g++	gcc
gcc not g++ historically would not by default include the mathematical functions while linking

10409093
stdout	stderr
the source code for truecrypt is available so you could modify it to output to stdout stderr

10409099
portrait	landscape
when i push from one view to another view in landscape portrait mode and move back in same mode the shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation method called on move back

10409112
post	get
in rest architecture get and post are just the verbs which tells either to retrieve or create update the resource

10409172
submit	submission
then if you want to do it without a page reload you write an ajax script and hook it to the submit button and disable the form from submission

10409179
rpm	yum
if installation is done via yum or directly from rpm files and rpm package has python-config as its dependency then even if you install python config from setup.py file missing package error wouldn t go away

10409179
rpm	yum
in this case you may have to do force install using yum or rpm or install main application via different method

10409185
width	height
i need access to already evaluated width and height of all component in fragment view

10409190
post	get
you need to include the authentication token somehow in the request either as a get or post paramater or in the header

10409190
post	get
post or get is simply a matter of adding the paramater to the request data

10409200
mouse	keyboard
eventargs itself is pretty pointless as it has no information - but it s used as the base class for other classes which do have information such as keyboard and mouse information

10409239
websphere	ibm
i am using ibm websphere v 7.0

10409239
jobs	cron
i want to use cron jobs for logging purposes

10409259
fseek	fread
it s pretty similar to regular fread fseek functions

10409309
hide	show
the idea is to hide everything then show them in increments

10409314
put	get
i m not sure if there s a way to put it somewhere i can easily get it from

10409315
free	malloc
it is a pretty common misconception that malloc directly gets memory allocations from the host operating system when called and free directly releases them back to the host operating when called

10409315
free	malloc
the context maintains its own list of malloc d and free d memory and will expand and contract the memory held in that list as host driver window manager and the gpu itself allows

10409315
free	malloc
this implies there is rather coarse granularity in cudamalloc calls and means sometimes a malloc appears to not effect the amount of free memory or to consume much more memory than was requested and sometimes free calls appear to have no effect if you are interested you can find a little tool which helps illustrate the page size behaviour of the cuda driver here although it was written for an early version of the cuda api and might need a couple of changes to compile with modern versions

10409318
getter	setter
string password and correspongding setter and getter for the same

10409365
width	height
try setting the webviews height and width according to the pages width and height and then take the screenshot

10409368
client-side	server-side
i do not suggest ajax as it is way harder for hackers to hack into php then javascript-related technology as javascript is client-side and php is server-side

10409381
for-loop	arrays
and then iterate through the original arrays using a for-loop

10409381
for-loop	arrays
so basically every iteration of the for-loop clears the arrays created above

10409430
asterisk	freeswitch
other solutions comparable to asterisk are yate and freeswitch

10409519
put	get
if you just want to put 3 flickr photos in a page you can use the share button when viewing each photo at flickr to get a piece of html you can then paste into a page

10409546
post	get
from there this blog post showed me how to traverse the plist s structure and get the correct string in this case the fifth element in the file corresponding to cfbundleshortversionstring

10409614
stdout	fflush
the problem is stdout is almost always buffered and in this case the buffer will not be fflush unless explicitly told to until after threader exits

10409614
fflush	gets	stdout	fflush
that is why the reader will not see anything and then suddenly it will get a burst of output when threader exits and stdout gets fflush

10409650
try-catch	exception-handling
maybe you should try to capture an outofmemoryerror better to catch throwable which will catch it too instead of an exception-handling in try-catch block at captureandsaveimage

10409674
centroid	convex
there is a single white blob in the image nearly circular and i want to find the centroid of the blob it s always convex

10409686
post	get
for example if i have a retrievebalance post that takes the id number of the person in the body anybody can call this method with other id numbers and get their balance

10409701
pylons	pyramid
pylons is called pyramid now after the project merged with repoze.bfg some time ago

10409706
uitableview	uisearchbar	hide	show
i have put a uisearchbar into uitableview headerview and in viewcontroller viewdidload methods sets the headerview height to 0 and hide the searchbar and wanted to show searchbar when the button will touched in touch handler i restore the headerview height and show uisearchbar but the searchbar overlays the first row of tableview

10409729
proficy	historian
we are two university students doing an internship at a company that currently uses a proficy historian database for storing real-time data

10409729
proficy	historian
as indicated the database is a proficy historian 3.0 database running on a server

10409748
hash	md5
in order to track file changes i am using an md5 hash i had problems using timestamps

10409786
width	height
in addition the image width and height is wrong as well the only correct data that i found in the header is the bmfh.bftype which is 19778

10409789
google-chrome	safari
this process displays the first dialogue in all browsers but shows an error for the second dialogue in safari and google-chrome

10409789
google-chrome	safari
i understand that google-chrome has a caching process but not sure how may effect this or if it exist in safari

10409789
google-chrome	safari
in any case it appears that the second call the ajax fails in safari and google-chrome before the returned javascript is run

10409789
google-chrome	safari
hence due the fact that the same ajax functions are run and the same code is being returned google-chrome and safari are having issues with the second call

10409823
inherited	properties
the properties are inherited implicitly no need to model them explicitly again

10409885
free	malloc
adding to what sarnold says it could be helpful to free in the opposite order as malloc - especially for the smaller memory chunks

10409886
width	height
so i thought that i should define height or width in terms of screen

10409886
width	height
but don t know how to use that in defining height or width from java file

10409890
implements	extends
for doing above you cant do simply creating a thread in anonymous inner class do it efficiently by creating a class extends thread and implements one listener which notifies both ui thread and background for image downloaded or not

10409897
stdout	stderr
as best i can tell nothing is disconnecting the process from the stdout stderr streams - the terminal is still open for example and everything appears to be fine

10409928
width	height
i currently do a strait copy of images that are the correct width height to go into my site

10409991
sdp	turn	sip	sdp
i find that freeswitch handle the incoming message as a normal sip invite and will generate a session also a channel instance for the invite i make.the channel state is set to cs_new then it into the sofia state callback to handle the different stage of sip procedure.when the sdp is parsed the freeswitch tell me the sdp is not match so the session is turn off and the channel is hungup.i don t know how to configuration if the freeswitch support msrp or how to make this right.thank you very much if you can give me more infomation

10410030
filtering	grouping
the reduce function should essentially filtering out the duplicates and grouping them all together

10410049
uitableview	nsindexpath
to create an nsindexpath for use in a uitableview use this method

10410049
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you also need to call this from viewwillappear rather than viewdidload the static table is not populated that early on

10410153
ubuntu	linux
i have a .so file that was created on linux ubuntu

10410154
uilabel	uibutton
i have created uiview say a object through code and added all the sub views like uibutton uilabel etc

10410163
bigloo	gambit
bigloo scheme- c gambit elk or scm can be used

10410191
put	get
i created a custom jquery ui theme and downloaded it from jquery site but i get 3 main errors when i put the script into a maven project in eclipse

10410216
jqgrid	datatables
i had the same problem and ended up dropping jqgrid and getting datatables instead -

10410242
parseint	isinteger
whereas calling some isinteger method and then convert using parseint will always cause a performance overhead for valid numbers - the strings are parsed twice once by the check and once by the conversion

10410274
cvs	svn
commit uploads your changes on the cvs svn server and update overwrites the files on your localhost with the ones on the server

10410289
decimal	ieee
your problem is decimal numbers are represented as ieee compliant binary representation 32 64 or 128 bit

10410310
getter	setter
a lot of people have mentioned encapsulating the specifics of the implementation which to me is the biggest reason to use getter and setter in a class

10410310
getter	setter
if you choose the form a+bi for internal representation and expose that using fields rather than getter and setter not only do you force the class consumers to use that form you also cannot later easily change your mind and replace the internal representation with re iî because that turns out to be easier to implement in your particular scenario

10410317
postgresql	mysql
hsqldb 2.x is very standards-compliant also mysql knows the bit_and aggregate function which is a non-standard alias to every also supported by postgresql

10410329
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe	xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
when you use add service reference add web reference xsd.exe wsdl.exe or svcutil.exe only properties are described - all your methods declared on server are lost

10410347
google-chrome	safari
ie google-chrome and safari have built in profilers in the web development

10410367
folder	directory
i find out than one good option is to right click folder in the ide and select tje option mark directory as - excluded

10410368
cvs	svn
try using a svn or cvs solution.

10410386
mouse	keyboard
i ve implemented changecase keyboard shortcut like shift+f3 in ms word for richtextbox which changes the text either selected by mouse or the last word before caret s position

10410395
width	height
x y facewidth and faceheight are coordinates of the box and the width and the height passed into the kalman filter

10410462
mouse	keyboard
with my current code the keyboard layout changes every time i plug in my mouse

10410490
width	height
data is saved to session data as in rotation angle cropping - x y width height resize - ratio of width and height original_image_width thumb_image_width

10410490
width	height
if it s cropping the x y width and height must be calculated so that cropping takes place only once

10410490
width	height
since resizing takes place between each cropping to fit to workarea i can t seem to work out the math to calculate to needed variables x y width height

10410498
apache	nginx
do it via apache or better nginx

10410517
disk	ram
you could use a ram disk

10410528
width	margin
also you should be incrementing the slide margin by 500px 460 width + 20px margin + 20px padding

10410553
pentaho	saiku
if you are considering leveraging the reporting module and analytic tool of pentaho along with cdf i would suggest integrating saiku as there is no more support for jpivot in pentaho

10410571
int	chars
btw you have to set ah to 1 before int 21h that reads a chars into al from the keyboard

10410644
hide	show
edit btw if anyone wishes to use a theme via the manifest and uses actionbarsherlock you could use either theme.sherlock.light.noactionbar or theme.sherlock.noactionbar and if you wish to hide show in code simply use getsupportactionbar hide and getsupportactionbar .show

10410648
put	get
just get them and whatever data you need along with them and put all these in the sqlite database

10410664
pop-up	dialog
so it seems that after 2nd call of jquery dialog telerik mvc controls which are inside this dialog loose a capability to display any pop-up divs telerik s dropdownlist and datepicker are similar that they need to show floating div with a list of items or a calandar when you click on the arrow or calendard icon but manual edit of text in editable areas still works

10410679
geocoding	geocode
assuming that you call initalize before the geocoding otherwise geocode will be undefined

10410699
avro	thrift
i was curious to know whether avro or protobuf thrift replaces the writables interface or avro is just meant for serializing the mr client data but not the internal communication between say namenode and datanode

10410704
submit	submission
is it possible to return back a html page with form from servlet whose on body load it will submit a form and on submission of this form it will receive the response xml which will get processed

10410717
maven	pom.xml
i have tried to use maven resource filters and that works for the pom.xml files and about.mappings but not for the rest

10410725
folder	directory
i want to copy all the folder within site1 to all the folder within the following directory

10410754
int	chars
here p is a chars pointer pointing to int x

10410781
onfocus	onblur
all of that works fine except for the onfocus and onblur events

10410836
getter	setter
have a member to hold the senderid and corresponding getter and setter methods.

10410887
portrait	landscape
in xib file there are 2 views portrait and landscape

10410937
hide	show
i have some code that show hide checkboxes using the visibility attribute

10410937
button	checkbox
if the button is visble when the form is submitted i need to somehow ensure that all visible checkbox are indeed checked

10410990
cpu	processors
most emulators just pre-load the emulated processors s memory with whatever data you want to have there before starting the cpu

10411010
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
app works fine on google-chrome firefox safari and on iphone ipad but on android it doesn t show data

10411064
post	get
when you have that you simply get the user friends me friends then you ll need to render the list yourself since the only plugin that facebook offers is the request dialog which works just for canvas pages and does not post to the wall

10411086
width	height
you can configure the machines display height width dpi when you create a virtual device in avd manager

10411091
versioning	upgrade
doesn t have an event or something which is fired when the upgrade actually was needed so i have no idea if there was a previous versioning and thus show the whats new form

10411113
tolower	toupper
apparently the update successfully applies if the two string values are not identical when applying toupper or tolower

10411114
jar	war
i am trying to place my web resources in a jar insetad of putting them at the roor dir of the war file

10411119
superclass	subclassing
if you want to have a field with a different default value in a subclassing define it only in the superclass and assign a value to it in the subclassing constructor

accessor	ivar
it s only when you access it via the accessor methods using either self.myobject or that you re not directly accessing the ivar

10415557

10415576
dbcontext	objectcontext
i see that the base class of the context is objectcontext and not dbcontext

10415595
implements	extends
as far as practical reasons go i think the only reason you may want to extends thread rather than implements runnable today would be to override its methods other than run

10415627
getter	setter
but i would suggest to create a pojo a java bean with getter and setter in simple terms and set properties using the parameters received

10415638
floating-point	integer
the 100.0 forces floating-point math from that point on and the + 0.5 rounds to the nearest integer instead of truncating

10415647
width	height
you have the 200x200 div with position relative and overflow hidden and let it contain an img tag with position absolute src attribute of the user picture and width and height scaled

i would post this question in the wtp forum if you can t figure out how to get to the xml editor source from the link below

10415715

10415884
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that i see these strange messages both in google-chrome and firefox

10415904
implements	extends
the only time i can think of where i might extends thread rather than implements runnable -- or even better just using an executorservice with a future -- is when i needed to override thread.interrupt to do some cleanup

10416019
put	get
to put multiple files at once use mput or to get multiple files at once use mget although you will probably be prompted for each file that is uploaded downloaded

10416019
put	get
if you still get errors make sure you have permission to put files in the directory that you are in on the server

10416026

10416090
apache	nginx
django says you should never serve static resources with django they should be served directly by the webserver you re using as a reverse proxy for django apache nginx etc. but it makes no contention on whether that must be on a different server or the same server

10416097
width	height
set the flex application width and height to 100

10416097
width	height
no matter what the html template s width and height are always 100

10416097

worked in google-chrome not in firefox

10416190

10416274
opencart	vqmod
i have written a module that uses vqmod for opencart

10416275
int	chars
if the corresponding argument to printf is a chars that is a undefined behaviour and b probably leads to the value of the chars promoted to an int and possibly some arbitrary adjacent bytes being interpreted as a pointer

10416337
folder	directory
i am trying to copy all of my output files from the solution target directory to a shared bin folder but for some reason the files are not being copied

10416351

nexus	artifactory
i m learning about artifact repositories such as jfrog artifactory and sonatype nexus

10416442
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari use webkit which sencha touch requires in order to function

10416469

with android api 10 the best option for targeting tablet is probably just distinguishing the actual size of the screens in the code using something like

10416522
liferay	alfresco

the java primative int has a range of minimum value of -2 147 483 648 and a maximum value of 2 147 483 647

10416636
associativity	operator-precedence
expressions are parenthesized according to operator-precedence and associativity

10416747
coalesce	nvl
as others said nvl can be cascaded but the preferred solution would be to use coalesce instead

10416747
coalesce	nvl
2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion

10416755
free	malloc
that the value assigned to the varname is dynamically allocated using malloc for example and lives for as long is required remembering to free varname when no longer required

10416781
int	double
obviously when the returned result is double and you cast it to int you ll get only the highest 32 bits and the rest will be truncated - hence you always get the int math.pow 2 x

10416804
mouse	keyboard
i fixed it by unticking minimize window âœ - m in preferences keyboard mouse fusion shortcuts

10416811

10416861
google-chrome	firefox
does it work from the javascript console firefox google-chrome

10416862
width	height
now it works fine but the space that these resized images are going into are 200 height by 225 width and sometimes i will get an images that are tall and skinny and some images that are short and wide and that makes it difficult to fit them in the space ideally if i can resizes these images with them being squished or cut off but i m not sure if that s possible.

10416862
width	height
if that is not possible i guess i am looking to adjust this code so if its an image that is tall and skinny to resize with a height of 200 and if an image is wide and short to resize to width 225...i hope this makes sense

10416874
int	double
int d where d is a double greater than 2147483647 returns 2147483647 the largest representable value of type int

10416929
backgrounding	multitasking
specifically look for backgrounding execution and multitasking in the above link

10417042
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the status says aborted in google-chrome failed

10417066
versioning	upgrade
you should also know that most of the emoji characters are encoded using a 4 byte utf8 codepoint which cannot be stored in mysql unless you upgrade to versioning 5.5 and convert your tables to the utf8mb4 character set

put	get
problem when then connection is slow and i do a put for a file that is not yet completely uploaded i only get the yet uploaded part

10417137

on the page hide the min rent and max rent from css

10417145
backgrounding	multitasking
scroll down to the section in backgrounding execution and multitasking

10417190
getter	setter
i d like to take advantage of the enum find iterator in the library and not have to use 100 properties with getter setter and 100 outlets to the text fields and other controls in the ui

10417190
getter	setter
similar to an approach i ve seen in a program using this library i d like to have one getter and one setter with a switch based on the meta data s enumerated fieldid

10417190
getter	setter
within the getter and setter i d like to programmatically access the appropriate text field or other control in the ui to get or set the value as needed

10417190
getter	setter
can i use the binding to pass the appropriate meta data fieldid to the getter setter

10417243
google-chrome	safari
this is the current css i have to implement image reflections though applied to div tags which contain imagehyperlinks - fb and twitter and it works in google-chrome and safari

10417316
width	height
you can bind it to its parent s width and height as one of the many solutions

10417407
getter	setter
i filled in all my class variables and then right click on the page and select - source - generate getter and setter

10417411
put	get
a typical case where locking can be useful is a read-modify-write cycle you want to get the object modify it locally and put it back but disallow another client from making a competing change between the time you get it and the time you put it

10417411
put	get
update based on your updated question i see that you are see a partial truncated or half-uploaded version of the new file if you do a get concurrent with a put

10417429
getter	setter
in il getter and setter are converted into methods anyway

10417463
cout	cin
the cout cin and i all get the error error c2065 cin undeclared identifier

10417550
puts	gets
anything above 0 puts it above the map and it gets the mouseover

10417554
int	chars
everything works as expected - when i click submit the code in getconvertedvalue is called and i can throw error messages if the conversion values if the user enters chars in the int fields

10417572
puts	gets
if you want mq to really look after your messages use synchronous puts as described above persistent messages and perform your puts and gets within transactions aka syncpoint so you have full application control over the commit points

10417577
cout	cin
instead of you most likely want to include as that includes cin and cout

10417577
for-loop	loops
the semi-colon at the end of your for-loop ends the statement that executes in loops

10417579
int	double
so long as the types of return values are limited int double or std string a function like this will do the job

10417587
cout	cin
std cout and std cin are defined in iostream so you have to add at the top of your file

10417591
queue	fifo
now for your problem i don t see where it could hang unless you gave it a fifo queue for the pid file

10417628
cout	cin
1 you have to for the definitions of cin and cout

10417637
jar	war
i have a war artefact and i need use some of their classes from a jar

10417652
getter	setter
generate one getter or setter method using the right click option source - generate getter and setter

10417652
getter	setter
on the second blank line use the right click option source - generate getter and setter to generate the rest of the getter and setter

10417676
min	max
even better would be a function -- call it mycolorramp -- which is like colorramp but instead a maps values between min values and max values

10417751
getter	setter
just make the binding getter setter a normal getter setter and manipulate the datatablegroup inside the listener method instead

10417757
folder	directory
directory trunk and tags are tagged in the tags folder

10417759
folder	directory
i am new to yii and i need to get a list of files inside a directory outside of the system folder

10417782
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this cannot be a browser issue as it has been tried on several different windows pcs in google-chrome ie safari and firefox

10417796
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be a recurring issue that the tricks below work in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

10417806
put	get
simply put i get a cursor from the database iterate through it creating each list-item dynamically in code as textviews

10417817
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
in my code i am using fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

google-chrome	safari
it happens in google-chrome 18 google-chrome canary 20 and safari 5.1.2 5.1.4

10417902
setinterval	settimeout
first you will need to create an update function that is called by settimeout or setinterval and has access to your puzzle object

10417917
post	get
i get the file name in the post

10417920
equals	compareto
null s are not string so i cant use equals or compareto for split the null s from my list

10417963
ubuntu	centos
sshpass is in the ubuntu repo however for centos it needs to be installed from here

10417993
pillow	libjpeg
you just need to have a working libjpeg install before running the pillow install and you should be off to the races

10418124
int	double
i ve tried a lot of things already casting with float double unsigned int instead of only int and assigning to variables of those types as well

10418139
photoshop	fireworks
i know it s easy to create that effect in photoshop illustrator or fireworks

10418157

more generally i think quite a few developers quickly get lost in the inter-tangled mess of rdf owl skos ontologies reasoning engines etc

10418188
equals	gethashcode
i ve done this before by creating the gethashcode and equals methods for the skinnyitem class

10418215

you have to put it into xml content yourself but this is how you can post from php

10418221
post	get
apparently i wanted a get operation and i was running a post operation

10418231
int	boolean
i mean in php - in theory - i could use the same variable to store an int and then a string and then a boolean and then an array.

10418273
jobs	cron
i ve checked for cron jobs but there is nothing there using terminal

10418297
button	checkbox
don t use radio button use checkbox instead checked yes unchecked no

10418312
post	get
i couldn t comment on your first post but i wanted to kindly ask you if you could explain in a little more detail how you managed to get this list with date headers

10418318
google-chrome	firefox
if i open my webpage and then look at developer tools on the browsers like google-chrome firefox ie i see multiple copies of the same view javascript files loaded

10418365
post	put	post	get	put	get
in actual consideration example value put into verb has commonly of http get and post

10418368
width	height
i tried to change width and height in many tags but nothing new

10418393
post	put	post	get	put	get
the get post put delete actions correspond to the http request type

10418404
folder	directory
i added the path to the folder where is testlib.dll in properties- vc++ directories- executable directory

10418404
folder	directory
i added the path to the folder where is testlib.h in properties- vc++ directories- include directory

10418460
width	height
the original algorithm only deals with a single ever-expanding bin so i modified it to take a max width and height

10418565
width	height
possible solution a min-height on the div in css or computing the image dimensions and setting width and height when you append them

10418622
width	height
my problem is i cannot guess the width of my text so what would i need to do in order for my setbounds to take the width and height as the text is

10418623
pull	push
is it possible to push and maybe pull from mercurial hg to cm synergy

10418654
range	median
so is there any other approach which would give the result even when the points are very far apart where median gives a range which is of the order of 10 9

10418655
salt	md5	hash	salt	hash	md5
they suggested i use one-way encryption. now i m not a huge security freak but i m pretty sure this involves one aspect anyway stuff like md5 hash with salt or the like

10418673
for-loop	loops
let s restrict the requirements a bit no number overflow just for loops while can be sometimes transformed to full for-loop except when using continue etc. no breaks no modifications of the control variable inside the for-loop

10418688
melt	reshape
here it is with reshape in base though joran is right melt is likely easier

10418713
post	get
if you need further help it might be easier if you give it a try yourself and see what issues arise so that you can focus your question post some code and get a more detailed response

10418720
width	height
this method uses a postscript command snippet of to shift and place the pdf pages on a smaller media size defined by the -gnnnnxmmmm parameter which defines device width and height in pixels

10418726
daemons	systemd
but as i understand it memory mapping relies on buffering by the operating systemd and so i m not sure what would happen if my daemons updates the input bytes while my client app is in the middle of a read operation

10418748
post	get
you wish to set the destination with your imagedata the above post shows a function which will serve the image through a get request like so

10418799
vim	emacs
i ve searched the vim docs but was unable to find a way to embed the syntax mode in a file like the major-mode does for emacs

10418838
boost	allocator
it has support for object oriented non-singleton usage but you will have to wrap it to an allocator object supported by boost unordered_map

10418848
pull	push
right now if i want to add an element to the set i need to pull the row from hbase deserialize it into a setwritable add my element serialize the setwritable and then push it back to hbase

10418906
post	get
there s already 2 tools available in wordpress import and export xml in backend just install that and you ll get what you want there s no need to do any custom thing on every post but if you still want it then read about publish_post hook

10418916
int	chars
i assume intconvert ... converts an int to a string and thus you get lexical comparisons which meahs 25 is greater than 100 because the first chars is greater 2 1

10418919
automake	autotools
i am writing a small library and want to make it accessible using autotools with automake 1.11

10418987
folder	directory
the implementation was such that we had a symlinked directory symdir inside the web content folder that pointed to another folder on the same filesystem but outside the web application and wasce for that matter

10419005
hide	show
if i hide the img wait some time and show it again it works but it s an ugly hack.

10419037
folder	directory
when i execute this command all the files in st2 project gets added to the www directory and not the folder and the files containing in those folder

10419068
lseek	posix	lseek	fseek
note that those platforms which have functions like the posix lseek will also likely have an iso c fseek which works from seek_end

10419156
int	double
one way to do that is to convert the random int to a double between 0 and 1 then convert back to an int

10419213
folder	directory
you can make sub folder in your res directory api level specific by adding a suffix like -v11

10419221
uiview	subviews
this is a view controller mvc with a uiview subviews the latter where drawing takes place

10419225
int	chars
so if you have a tree with an int range of 0 - 25 you can print out a valid chars of a - z

10419252
folder	directory
my feeling is that we should have a folder under the root of our project named something like dependancies or thirdparty with all of the dlls included there and set their build event to copy to the output directory

10419280
int	chars
i think that unsigned int is converted to signed chars and thus it will be -1

10419288
setinterval	settimeout
if you d like to see stack trace that spans over settimeout setinterval calls then more sophisticated would be the way to go

10419294
width	height
by default android tabs does not support set width and height in xml

10419348
int	chars
in a tiff between signed chars and unsigned int unsigned int wins

10419362
implements	extends
here is one of the way of implements it please take a look and also pls extends refactor it based on your needs

10419368
getter	setter
i think you need to add the getter and setter to the users class

10419371
post	get
step 3 if i first post my url to the linter and get its id

10419407
int	chars
i would either cast the chars to an unsigned int if the unsigned int s value is greater than sizeof chars

10419407
int	chars
or cast the other way if the unsigned int s values are to be restricted to a sizeof chars

10419410
portrait	landscape
similarly switching from portrait to landscape is a configuration changes so that too makes sense

10419437
opennlp	lingpipe
i ve heard the names of gate lingpipe and opennlp - however i m unsure whether they fit my needs

10419442
hide	show
as others have pointed out it is much more preferable to hide show the image through css either visibility none if you want to keep the space occupied or display none if you want the image to completely disappear

10419477
hide	show
my choice was to create a function in ajax asynchronous call to which this report was generated and while this process does not answer me back i hide the button and show the loading and so has the return button i show and hide the loading

10419485
ati	nvidia
judging from results of google search nvidia provides api for overclocking their gpus and there are some ati tools available as well though ati tools look unofficial

10419489
ubuntu	centos
however one is running ubuntu 10.04 where i compiled while the other is running centos 5

10419494
put	get
but when i want the specific event to open in a new window when clicked i just get the event that lies last on the screen when i put this in a browser

10419539
int	double
if you re comparing int s to double s you re going to need to come up with whatever rules you want to use when determining if two values are close enough. you may consider using the std modf function in in making the comparison

10419539
int	double
in your case though you re trying to compare a double with an int and i have to assume you want some rounding

i also feel that the search and result objects should not contain hard coded getter setter and should instead be a collection of search fields and a collection or map of result columns

10423686
int	double	int	chars
a possible solution is to give pass in an array of strings or a chars and an int if you prefer passing in your double as strings as well

apparently that was a mistake because the nova-compute node trying to launchd the image crashes on daemons startup with a networknotfound error presumably because it can t find the misconfigured network id i had to delete

10424130
x86	mips
no two processor families are the same an arm and an x86 and a mips have no reason to resemble each other in any way and may very well not look the same even though on all of them you can say for example store the value 0x1234 to the address 0x1000 using an instruction

mouseup	mousedown
the problem is that i have events assigned mousedown mouseup etc... to the svg element beneath the html

10424160
mouseup	mousedown
all of the views have been bound with mousedown and mouseup events

10424160
mouseup	mousedown
but every time i go from a subview to the index view and then go to any of subviews again the mousedown and mouseup events in the current subview will be triggered one more time which means when i click the subview there will be several consecutive mousedown events triggered followed by several consecutive mouseup events triggered

10424160
mouseup	mousedown
so i think that s why the mousedown and mouseup will be triggered several times

10424250
width	height
if i print out points width height .x 0 i get a number from the rgb code

10424677
post	get
if i changed the authentication to apikeyauthentication then i would have to post the username and api key on each get post request to a resource

10424677
post	get
the problem with doing that is that i would have to create a new intermediate view which queried for the username and the view and then did the get post to the tastypie endpoint

10424677
post	get
the second way is to embed the username and apikey into the webapp and get js to grab those values and add them to the get post querystring but this could lead to a security issue

10424729

this happens to me only in mozilla firefox and not on google-chrome

10424801
heroku	engineyard
i checked out bitnami heroku and engineyard and ran some serious tests against heroku and engineyard and engineyard was by far the winner

10424801
heroku	engineyard
the cost is actually cheaper on engineyard than on heroku once you start adding web dynos and the performance is way way better especially if you switch to the jruby stack

10424801
heroku	engineyard
i think heroku is a good solution if you are not concerned about performance or scalability and just want to deploy a simple web app it is probably easier to use than engineyard for that sort of thing

10424806
pdfsharp	itext
normally i would use itext or pdfsharp but i was introduced to aspose and was using it as a test for this project has some cool features to desaturated image and save space which work very nicely - a tb of tiffs is about 200gb of pdf

10424874
implements	extends
now i want to extends my outer class and implements displaydata method differently for extended classes based on the type of response object i am expecting

10424876
accessor	properties
then the problem is that the outercontrol.inner properties has a set accessor

10424876
accessor	properties
next because the inner properties has a set accessor asp.net creates a new instance of innercontrol not asp.innercontrol_ascx as you might expect and attempts to initialize its url properties to #

10424902
namenode	checkpoint
basically the checkpoint node is a new implementation of the secondary name node and the backup point is an interim release on the way to a warm-standby for the namenode plus it can currently offer a small performance boost by separating reads and writes - reads in the name node and writes in the backup node

10424969

width	height
aspect ratio width height value -- important

10425062
integer	fractions
over the top keep the integer and fractions parts as separate small integers

10425062
integer	fractions
this will require an additional floating point operation at the end to combine the integer and fractions parts probably not worth it

10425073
screens	tablet
fragments was developed by google as the screens size of tablet is large and we can accommodate more functionality in one screens

addclass	removeclass
so click addclass slide menu open click again slide menu closed removeclass

10425075
toggleclass	slidetoggle
i ve tried adding before the slidetoggle function instead of using the toggleclass which gives me the correct effect on the first click but i can t figure out how to remove the class after the nav has closed again

setinterval	clearinterval
there is a function which sets an interval using setinterval but even after calling clearinterval i can see in the console that the else condition is still running

10425129
tunnel	vpn
i would recommend setting up a vpn tunnel between the remote iis server and the in-house sql server

10425129
tunnel	vpn
with a vpn tunnel the sql server is just like any other server on the network to the app

10425136
setinterval	settimeout
note that we only call setinterval once versus settimeout every time we didn t want it to continue

10425175
setinterval	settimeout
apparently you have mistaken setinterval for settimeout

10425175
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval runs the enclosed function every n milliseconds while settimeout executes only once after n milliseconds

10425193
memcpy	strncpy
we use memcpy because strncpy checks each byte for 0 on every copy

10425328
post	get
what i want to do is grant access to a file in my bucket using an http get post request

10425328
post	get
i don t want to do that i want the file to be privately available at a url with required post or get credentials deciding who can access the file would be based on a database containing application users and their permissions

10425328
post	get
i understand the security implications of passing any kind of credentials over get or post on a non-https connection

10425354
for-loop	arrays
note i understand that i could probably use something like boost ptr_vector but i wanted similar to hashtable functionality so the for-loop would need additional information but that is outside of the direct scope of this question which is why i am using a traditional arrays

10425897
getter	setter
property getter and setter in most any object-oriented language provide an external or user interface around private members of instances of your classes

10425897
getter	setter
this way you can for example protect a private variable from receiving an invalid or out-of-range value or make a property read-only by providing only a getter but no setter

10425897
getter	setter
even more interesting is the idea that getter and setter may wrap properties that aren t natively retained in your class but might for example be computed based on other instance members

10425897
getter	setter
getter and setter surely aren t unique to objective-c

10425902
nexus	artifactory	ant	maven
if they are going to use any non-maven way to retrieve them ui rest scripts ant gradle then you can go with any path and name you like and you ll get full support from artifactory uploading searching etc. with nexus which is much more maven-centric you ll better stick to maven notation

ganglia	metrics
metrics includes a reporter interface with several implementations for other statistics repositories like graphite and ganglia

10425920
getter	setter
getter and setter are used to control changes to a variable field

10425920
getter	setter
often a setter is accompanied by a getter also known as an accessor which returns the value of the private member variable

10425920
getter	setter
getter setter methods may also be used in non-object-oriented environments

10425920

children	parent
so if you want to maintain immutability you can t create a node until its children have been created because those children have to be specified at the time of creation but you also can t set parent pointers on the children before the parent has been created because the parent doesn t exist

10426800
children	parent
certainly maintaining parent pointers makes the programmer s life more difficult because as soon as you change one node in the tree you have to make changes to all its children s parent pointers which is a pain

10433743
lme4	mgcv
mgcv gamm does handle binary data although it uses pql which is generally less accurate than laplace ghq approximations as in gamm4 lme4

10433743
mgcv	nlme
your desired autocorrelation structure autocorrelation can exist within each single value for block but assume independence among blocks is exactly the way correlation structures are coded in nlme and hence in mgcv gamm

free	malloc
in c++ there it is rare that one would need to use malloc and free and don t use them unless you have good reasons to do so

10434147
free	malloc
things allocated by malloc need to be deallocated by free

10434147
free	malloc
then you are correct in thinking that without a destructor the memory allocated by malloc will not be free

width	height
if your text won t be larger than the width of the box you could set the line-height equal to the height of the box

10437784

10437837
bindparam	bindvalue	bindparam	pdostatement	pdostatement	bindvalue
since even php doesn t know what type its variables are i believe the only way to do that is to directly bind them with either pdostatement bindparam or pdostatement bindvalue as you are doing although it isn t strictly necessary to specify the argument as a simple int cast of the gives php s otherwise clueless type system enough to work with

10437845

put	get
the problem is that regardless of where i put the whitespace in around the bold tag i can t get a space before the t in this

10438394
children	parent
i think this is where you re coming from because i was in that boat once too not understanding the relationship between updating a property and it affecting it s siblings parent children but it s really key to reducing processing load since a property can be modified multiple times between frame refreshes and it doesn t need to re-calculate everything around it until it will actual be redrawn

10438403

the issue i m encountering is that every time i make a draw call when rendering a light to be added to the light map it completely replaces all data in the texture including its width and height

10438990
getattr	setattr
the heart of the matter is that python interprets lines of code left to right so when it arrives at a statement like it s first operation is a getattr a b and not a setattr so i can t determine easily if the last operation in the stack of operations is an assignment

10439051
inherited	subclassing
note because tutorial is a subclassing of document it inherited both its fields and its methods

the first example show how to have multiple datatables on one page while the other allows you to show hide details about each row

10439096

i have applied the class datatable to each of my dynamically generated tables so the following code turns them all into datatables and disables sorting on the first column since that s where the show hide icon goes

10439322
min	max
do this iteratively involves both host and device code till you are left with only one set of min max values

an alternative if your current work distribution is amenable is to find the min max inside of each workgroup and write it to a buffer in global memory index local_id

10439330
post	get
it s usually recommended to use post redirect get pattern for example

10439338
stdout	stderr
if you re directly doing something like fprintf or syslog to do your logging it might be simpler to create a wrapper app that launches the main app and the wrapper creates the debugging console window and displays the main app s stdout and or stderr

10440244
hide	show
jared s answer was the solution - here is my code where i just added the else statement to perform the hide show of the list items if indeed there were a matching set

10440244

ssl	https
then the client sends ssl tls request to the server and they continue with ssl handshake and then with https if requested

10442767
ssl	https
while https request can be sent via http proxy this is almost never done because in this scenario the proxy will validate server s certificate but the client will be able to receive and validate only proxy s certificate and as name in the proxy s certificate will not match the address the socket connected to in most cases an alert will be given and ssl handshake won t succeed i am not going into details of how to try to address this

10442785

it smells to high heaven to me foremost because singletons are being inherited from as well as the way instance in the base class has its value overwritten in the static initializers of the subclassing

for-loop	loops
i am using a for-loop but after the value 5 loops should break.

rational-numbers	integer
the only way around it is to express the calculations in terms of integers or rational-numbers if you can and use an arbitrary precision integer package to do the calculations

10443160
range	infinity
the reason is that the product of those 20 numbers 10e400 is outside the range of double-precision floating-point numbers and so it s set to infinity

10443225
hide	show
the list does not have to be an infinite loop it just has to show hide the right item in the right position depending on what button is clicked

10443243
pull	push
then i remembered you were talking about the emulator where adb runs as root so you can just adb push pull database files right to the app s private storage area - though you probably want to make sure the app isn t actually running when you do that

google-chrome	firefox
update the explanation is tricky as it is a matter of implementation in firefox as google-chrome and ie behave as you expected my guess is that firefox prevents firing related events when you are in the event handler for the same element a thing that may potentially lead to infinite cycle using settimeout you are firing the event soon after you leave the handler and even ui has a chance to redraw itself

10444209
int	boolean

prepare	execute
mysql 5.1.17 or 5.1.21 for the prepare and execute statements can use prepare statements in the query cache

10455228

i suspect that the problem is that you are using a filewriter instead of a fileoutputstream hooked up the a outputstreamwriter where the osw specifies utf-8 as the encoding

10455288
children	parent	width	height
in order to size something to the width of it s children you would need to get the height and width with javascript and set it on the parent element

10455300

second i don t know how could i get assuming the one who enters the app page tab is an admin all the users who liked the page post without using an access_token because this damn access_token has an expiration time and if i could i d try not to use an access token at all since i assume the user who gets in into some parts is an admin

10455519
accessor	properties
cocoa style notes properties variables should have lowercase initial letters and this is actually more important now because of arc don t name accessor methods to start with get -- that has a specific meaning in cocoa involving passing in a buffer and getting data back by reference

versioning	upgrade
i m looking for the simplest way for the user to upgrade to the full versioning while preserving the data from the lite versioning

10455589
for-loop	loops
also the iterator statement in the for-loop contains a lot of operations instead of loops actually having a body

10455643
width	height
display inline-block makes width and height go to auto like an inline element and as you said default vertical align is baseline

10455652
hash	md5
another idea is to store all tweets as text and add another column with the tweets hash to md5 and add a unique key over the column

10455913
put	get
i would use so it s obvious what you put in a name and get out an age it reads nicely in assignments which could be read as put 49 into the name-to-age map for diego maradonna

10455930
folder	directory
it s trying to look in the directory where i m debugging the main program from which is a completely different project on a completely different path than the plugins and the file it s looking for is the name of the dll but in the folder where the program is running

10456107
pull	push
now whenever you do pull or push operations to git github.com the alternate identity file will be used

10456117
width	height
after the two images which is the same width and height

10456124
width	height
this works accurately where the width and height of the containedview is larger than that of the scrollview and sets the views so that subsequent scrolling will take you exactly to the edges of the containedview

10456124
width	height
however when either dimension of the image is smaller than the scrollview width and height the image is magnetically attracted to the top left corner of the screen

10456124
width	height
for example with scrollview.bounces no a horizontal image whose height is smaller than the height of the scrollview but whose width is larger so it can be scrolled from left to right will scroll further to the left than it should when scrolling to the right it stops correctly at the edge of the image although if scrollview.bounces yes it then bounces in from the edge so the image is always cropped on the left when the image is larger in both dimensions than its containing scrollview this issue accentuates and the whole result feels broken which is unsurprising given apple s documented advice

10456143
concave	convex
the problem is the function i m using scipy.interpolate.griddata uses the convex hull of the cloudpoint in the plane x y thus giving as result some values that don t exist in the original surface which has a concave perimeter

10456210
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried in several browsers google-chrome firefox etc... but it all looks the same

to try and solve this i was hoping to trigger the mouseup event followed by the mousedown event so that jquery will use the new container size

10456236

drools	jess
so - the other question is - is there theory of production rule systems for rule engines like drools jess clips and so on and is there practical need for such theory and what are the practical issues of using drools and other systems that can be addressed by the theory of production rule systems

10456360
folder	directory
either provide an absolute path to the file or place it in the same directory or folder i believe is the windows vernacular as your ffmpeg binary

but the problem is my code works fine on ie8 but on firefox and google-chrome it just displays a blank page

10456506
google-chrome	firefox
if i directly request the welcome page from the address bar it is displayed correctly both in firefox and google-chrome

10456506
google-chrome	firefox
its only the display of the welcome page that is having problems in firefox and google-chrome

10456542
mouse	keyboard
what focus means is that any given window receives mouse and keyboard messages

10456542
mouse	keyboard
in order for scroll bar to process mouse click or keyboard to move slider scroll bar must have focus

10456542
mouse	keyboard
it is a popup window that for the duration has keyboard focus and captures mouse

while directly computing and comparing hands seems an attractive exercise there are almost no applications for computers with reasonable amounts of ram disk for which they would be practical

10456561
public	protected
i have a java public class a that has two protected static methods foo and bar

10456570
google-chrome	firefox
this works properly meaning it appends the audio track onto the page in google-chrome but fails at different points in internet explorer and firefox

10456587
children	parent
a better approach would probably be to give them all the same class and then use things like parent find children etc

10456594
width	height
this makes it difficult to use in scenarios where images can take up the entire browser view port instead of the predefined width and height

10456594
width	height
the images that i want to use in the slider are of 1600px in width and 804px in height which i want to be scaled as per the aspect ratio and browser screen size on different screens

10456698
ready	each
perhaps writing enough zeros after each write to be able to detect later and then backing up to be ready for the next write

10456706
google-chrome	firefox
i have a websocket client server that works perfectly with firefox and google-chrome 18

10456707
put	get
i have the following code that uses a settimeout to delay showing my progress indicator it s basically a twitter bootstrap modal that i enable and it has a progress indicator gif in it but it appears to not work when i am debugging and put a brek point on my server side code which then in my client-side settimeout it should go off but the settimeout is never called until my server returns a response so i never get the progress bar then if taking too long

10456727
versioning	upgrade
edit #2 in my own troubleshooting i upgrade ffmpeg from the default 12.04 ubuntu versioning to the one you see in edit #1 above

10456727
ffmpeg	libvpx
if i recompile x264 libvpx and ffmpeg with the --enable-pic flag opencv compilation still fails this time with kdbwin.o .rodata instead of avpacket.o av_destruct_packet respectively in the snippet above

10456727
ffmpeg	libvpx
edit #6 fixed the above error by adding --enable-shared to the configuration options of libvpx and ffmpeg

10456747
filtering	grouping
i m not totally sure what your update needs to do exactly but you could add a filtering on groups.groupname to your query and then do with to append a member only to the grouping that matched

10456759
filtering	grouping
it s because your user model can have multiple grouping so you need to match a grouping in the filtering and use the positional operator in the update

10456815
freemarker	velocity
if you are looking for a way to generate some complex html and also going to inject some data into it some templating engine velocity freemarker or any other would be useful here

10456840

10456863
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox there s no mouse events and no tool tip

10456866
vim	emacs
emacs and vim have their own configurable rules for symlink handling but most commands rely on the kernel to deal with it

10456923
free	malloc
another possibility would be to have my_malloc call malloc each time it needs to allocate memory and simply handle whatever bookkeeping aspects you re interested in such as number of blocks allocated number of blocks free largest outstanding block total allocated memory etc

10456924
ffmpeg	libav
my issue is that when i attempted to expand out from a single multimedia format into something more flexible specifically connecting to libav ffmpeg the direct2d render control starts to crash display drivers

10456965
put	get
after i get authentication from the user i add action to his activity that read an article from my site put i get this error

10456991
awt	swing
in this millennium use swing japplet jpanel rather than awt applet canvas

10457063
versioning	upgrade
apple s suggested way of dealing with this situation is to have just one app and implement in-app purchases to upgrade to the full versioning

10457070
hide	show
but that just hide everything and just show this particular div

10457115
for-loop	arrays
it s basically a summation of a large arrays but the elements of the arrays are calculated explicitly in the for-loop at the same time they are being summed

10457128

10457226
symfony	silex
silex uses several symfony components

10457257
rss	feed
however the posts i am wanting to update are actually being imported from an rss feed by the autoblogged plugin which i believe is using xmlrpc to post as these are the hooks it uses

10457266
folder	directory
copy the web directory into the right place in your project folder

10457283
apache	nginx
a software like nginx does it very well as well as apache of course mod_proxy i recall

10457356
min	max
i generate weights between two double values min max with an adjustable sparseness ratio

10457367
ubuntu	debian
if you install the bsd process accounting utilities package acct on debian and ubuntu you can use the sa 8 utility to summarize executions or give you semi-detailed execution logs

10457368
tiff	png
an option would be to save it as a file in some image format jpg png tiff using either matlab or java and return file instead of image

10457409
rss	feed
i m trying to require my template for rss feed in php

10457436
width	height
note that you should try to get the spritedimension etc values from the image itself by dividing the image width w and height h by the size of an individual sprite

10457509
pop-up	dialog
i m working on a gallery type application - one template puts together a pop-up dialog for a larger view of thumbnail images when clicked

10457561
folder	directory
if you are using maven clear the .m2 folder from your user directory build the project and that should help

10457605
int	double
for example 2 4.6 is parsed as int 2 and double 4.6 in my teststruct below

10457621
width	height
make sure you change the width height left and right values to match the width and height of your two image files

10457628
pop-up	dialog
the idea is that once the alert fires an alert dialog pop-up with a short blurb about the site with the option to either close the alert or get more info uses webview

10457668
post	get
basically i wanna retrieve all post by custom post type get all menu but ordered by taxonomy by reference

10457739
children	parent
it does not work across process boundaries parent existing children unrelated processes

10457748
serversocket	objectinputstream	objectoutputstream	serversocket	objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
the problem i m having is that when i call ois.readobject where ois is the objectinputstream created from the serversocket accept call it only ever returns the very first value that i write to the corresponding objectoutputstream on the client side

10457782
folder	directory
set up a target platform with all the external bundles you need - you can just dump them into a directory and then point the target platform configurator at that folder

10457820
onclick	onchange
it s easy to see this if you have a button field with onclick action and a text field with onchange action change the text field and move the cursor directly to the button and click it

10457820
mousemove	mouseout
to do this judicious use of mousemove and mouseout events can provide mouse tracking which can then be inspected in the onchange handler

10457856
put	get
instead you put the event on a parent object of the elements that will be created in the future but already exists and you supply a selector to specify which elements within that selector qualify to get the event called on

10457879
width	height
to get the top left corner of the view you simply take center and then subtract half of the width and height

10457896
int	chars
this function i made because i want to use printf_s rather then cout but i want a function that converts a int to a chars so that i can use it in other functions apart from printf_s

10457905
postgresql	mysql
only mysql and postgresql but postgresql does it in a much more limited way

10457929
accessor	properties
one caveat it s perhaps controversial but for various reasons it s generally frowned upon to use properties accessor in init and dealloc

10457929
accessor	properties
if you fall into the properties accessor in init dealloc is bad camp i do you could change it to this

10457929
accessor	properties
the code above is exactly equivalent to what you re doing except that it s not calling the properties accessor

now i get an exception whenever i send a post

10457996
lme4	nlme
detaching nlme before working with lme4 is a good idea

10458000
int	chars
if you allocate a static buffer then you can write the converted int into it and return a pointer to it just as the interface to your posted function shows but the chars string you d be returning would only continue to contain that number until the next time you called the function

10458000
free	malloc	int	chars
alternatively you could dynamically allocate a buffer in which to put the converted int s chars either using malloc or new and then the caller of your function would be responsible for later free ing or deleting the allocated buffer or else you d have a memory leak

10458000
int	chars
be sure whatever way you allocate it you allocate enough space for the largest numeric string you might need to create probably based on the size of an int 12 chars would be sufficient for representing any positive or negative 32-bit int value

10458036
outputstream	inputstream
you are trying to cast an inputstream actually a cipherinputstream to a subtype of outputstream

10458040
getter	setter
the getter setter functions are part of chipmunk 6

10458095
profiling	benchmarking	innodb	myisam
i m interested in learning why the different storage engines i benchmarking innodb myisam and memory have the profiling that they do

10458095
innodb	myisam
i m guessing that the answer will be along the following lines innodb fsyncs after each update since each update is an acid compliant transaction whereas myisam does not since it doesn t even support transaction

10458095
innodb	myisam
this gives us a similar behavior to myisam but we still get to benefit from the transaction features available in innodb

10458112

i am stuck on an html 5 project where the video works on google-chrome and safari pc browser but not on the ipad

using the httpservletrequest object you can get access to the url the client used to make the request the method used get post put etc the query string and headers

10458145

i put a demand list in the provider class so i could get all the demands related to that provider

10458170
x86	64bit
if you are using sharepoint 2010 then it is 64bit so you would look in program files and not program files x86

10458203
google-chrome	firefox
and i am testing my application on three different browsers ie 9 firefox 12 google-chrome to make sure that my application works well on these browsers

10458253
jobs	cron
you may then want to run cron jobs to run your jasmine tests and then report back if something breaks

10458253
versioning	upgrade
b if you use a single versioning of jquery and never upgrade you the run the risk of browser changes not being captured in jquery

10458273
nstimer	nsoperation
i d recommend using an nstimer perform a selector and in your selector launch an nsoperation to perform the download

10458354
public	protected
so a protected function can be overridden as either protected or public but it can t be overridden as private and a public function can only be overridden as public

10458354
public	protected
i have no idea why c# would restrict protected such that you couldn t override it with a public function

10458400
uilabel	nsstring
to jonathan-cichon s suggestion i have also generated pdfs from uiview s on which i just put he proposed nsstring s drawatpoint etc. i actually used plain old uilabel s

google-chrome	firefox
my django code works in google-chrome and firefox but in ie the webpage displays unreadable charactars

10458441
width	height
combined with the width height of each element you can calculate which element the draggable was over when the stop event is fired

10458449
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
why google-chrome or firefox or safari it s a free anyway

10458466
google-chrome	firefox
in both ie9 and firefox the background elements seem to work just fine but in google-chrome i m having the issue

10458513
superclass	subclassing
you can t call the subclassing s constructor from the superclass s constructor because it s the subclassing s constructor that called the superclass s constructor in the first place

10458513
superclass	subclassing
it s not that the superclass is being instantiated with the subclassing as some kind of parameter instead the superclass is instantiated as a step in instantiating the subclassing and the superclass should only know about its own structure leaving subclassing details to the subclassing constructor that triggered the superclass

10458542
subtract	add
i do that testing if the rotation changed more then 300 degrees in either direction if it does then you need to add or subtract 360 depending on the direction

10458543
portrait	landscape
i would like page 1 to be fixed to portrait and page 2 to be fixed to landscape

10458614
width	margin
i imagine the way to do this is to make the li a specific width and then apply an appropriate margin to the right side but for some reason i can t apply a width

10458653
inherited	properties
unless you change the container control to inherited from usercontrol a contained control will not conform to the container control s padding properties

10458680
uiview	calayer
you could simply create a proper catransform3d and set that to a uiview or calayer in the manner that i describe in this answer

10458717
try-catch	exception-handling
you don t really need the try-catch es and my guess is the initial myceconnection.open is throwing an exception-handling but you never see it because of the try-catch

10458762
put	get
i want to put and get these records using a single key value uniquecustomerid

10458763
width	height
you can re-size it programmatically by cgrectmake x y width height refer apple documentation for further variations

10458767

the selects are used only to determine which rows are to be updated and they are based on a column that holds boolean values probably translated to int internally by sqlite

int	boolean
also if you have simple fields such as ones that only hold a boolean value you may want to consider declaring it as an int instead of whatever you declared it as

10484870
int	double
declaring it as any type not specifically defined by sqlite will cause it to default to a numeric type which will take longer to compare values because it will store it internally as a double and will use the floating-point math processor instead of the int math processor

inherited	properties
the math object inherited a constructor properties through the prototype chain from its prototype which is the standard built-in object prototype

10485005
inherited	properties
that the math object also inherited object.prototype.constructor is merely a side-effect of that unconditional inherited in ecmascript implementations as with the exception of implementations of the edition 4 proposal and perhaps of future editions properties do not have a suitable visibility modifier to prevent that like private in several class-based languages

10485005
inherited	properties
and of course the constructor of object instances which inherited from the same prototype is the object referred to by the initial value of the object properties of the global object

i know that doesn t solve your problem with selenium and i know it s a pain if you ve already written your tests in selenium to re-do them in sahi so it may not be the solution you re looking for but if all else fails it may be worth considering

10485256
selenium	sahi
ps - you didn t mention anything about your development environment but there is a php-based testing tool called mink which integrates with both sahi and selenium -- ie you can write the a single test script and have it work in either

10485461

int	chars
i think it is as a result of the implicit typecasting from the chars to int while doing the arthimetic operation

finally you might consider using calloc instead of malloc as it automatically sets the contents of the array you allocate to be all-zeros rather than random garbage

while this is working in firefox it does not in google-chrome and i did not dare testing ie yet

10488968
getter	setter
it is best practice to call setter getter on member variables of java pojo class in your case i would suggest to use setter

10488970
getter	setter
there is no point in having a private setter getter unless some operation computation is actually done in the function

10488999
getter	setter
for example the arraylist class has size attribute with private setter for add and remove operations while the getter is public

10489002

distance	polygons
in such cases you should snap to the nearest polygons up to a certain distance and revert to the natural time zone the one determined by longitude alone in the open ocean

10489206
distance	polygons
to do this you will need code to compute the distance between a query point and a line segment of a polygons this is non-trivial since latitude and longitude are a non-euclidean coordinate system and your spatial index will need to be able to return nearby polygons not just potentially containing polygons

10489234
width	height
it is important to note that without some styling if you empty a table cell it may collapse to zero width or if all cells on a row are empty the row may collapse to zero height

innodb	myisam
this gives us a similar behavior to myisam but we still get to benefit from the transaction features available in innodb

10489327
spring-data-commons	spring-data-jpa
the only ressource i found regarding this problem points out errors in previous spring-data-jpa versions which are marked as fixed by now or errors using wrong dependencies to the spring-data-commons jar - however i m leaving that to maven so the data-commons version should be fine

10489336
post	get
now i am deserializing xml from a post if for whatever reason i am getting a string such as here is the int field 55444 instead of 55444 the error i get in response is input string was not in a correct format

10489891
int	double
numofmiles needs to be declared as a double not an int

10489892
width	height
for a sprite sheet where the frames are of different height width you could use scaling

10489892
width	height
how you navigate through the sprite sheet is up to you meaning you are not restricted to a sprite sheet of same height width

10489904
width	height
if i add .attr transform translate + width 2 + + height 2 + to the points.append call it s somewhere in southern indiana

10489911
put	get
i m starting to look into how to make projects modulair now i get the part that you can for example make a folder and put the module-files in there which brings the following question

10489942
google-chrome	firefox
i ve recently bought a htc one x and installed mozilla firefox and the google-chrome beta..

10490018
folder	directory
create a project folder structure i have a template directory structure which i copy

i m currently evaluating between flot rickshaw and flotr2

10490046
button	checkbox
i want to initialize this checkbox when the wpselecttasks page shows and read the value when the next button is clicked

10490106
post	get
the problem with the blobstore is that the files are saved on the server and other people can view them so my best solution is just to use a global variable to save the data from the post and then pass it to get and call get from javascript with window.open

10490111
post	get
based on your comments and post i m guessing you are trying to use the same method twice in a row so you get logged in

10490122
implements	extends
however rather than extends actionlistener as in your second example you ll probably find that putting the listener implementation into a different class even an inner class which implements actionlistener provides better logical logical separation of your code

10490184
for-loop	arrays
i have a php for-loop and in each one of these it throws out i have a javascript onload function with a for-loop looking to see if that id from mysql is in the javascript cookie arrays

10490197
hide	show
and i hide the second and the fifth element i would like to show

10490201

uiview	subviews
i create searchbarview a subclass of uiview and added uisearchbar as a subviews to it

10490285

i checked the source-code and depending on the configuration its hash with md5 or sha1

10490289
stdout	stderr
i want to send stdout to stderr

10490289
stdout	stderr
i was expecting following example to redirect stdout to stderr and that tmp test would would contain the output and error for the command

10490289
stdout	stderr
but instead it appears that stdout is never redirected to stderr and thus tmp test only contains the error from the command

10490289
freebsd	centos
i have tried the above example on centos unbuntu freebsd and macosx

10490295
client-side	server-side
if getting these in sync is an issue make the client-side timer shorter than the server-side one

nonetype	iterable
i found a discussion here but trying this i get a typeerror nonetype object is not iterable

10490388
webkit	gecko	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
browser rendering engines like webkit safari google-chrome or gecko firefox are opensource

10490430
calloc	malloc
the added benefit here is since you calloc ed instead of malloc ing your array all values are zero initially so in this case once you are done copying the data at len-nlcount through to len will all be zero ie 0 so it is automatically null-terminated like a string would be anyways

10490466
scheme	racket
racket and more generally scheme provides a port datatype that allows you to get sequential access to a file or stream

10490489
children	parent
the only exception was for 4 above which sometimes required me to hard code add children to data retrieval hierarchy though eventually i generalized this processes as well hierarchical data retrieval-get child element based on id of parent and so on down the hierarchy

10490496
pop-up	dialog

10490558
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the file downloads as expected from google-chrome firefox safari on my desktop

10490585
post	get
post get is made which inserts a row of data

10490585
post	get
post get is made again which should generate new data to insert is instead inserting the previous data with a unique proper primary key

10490636
int	chars
the warning i get is comparison between an int and a chars

10490639
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
obviously this must be consistent with the css spec i mean if google-chrome firefox and opera all agree on it i have very little doubt

10490667
int	chars
if you reflect over it you ll see that chars long int will fit your needs

10490746
inherited	subclassing
uitableviewcontroller inherited from uiviewcontroller so if you want to be able to call your custom method from both you can write a category on uiviewcontroller and then call methods from that category in any subclassing of either uiviewcontroller or uitableviewcontroller

10490790
google-chrome	firefox
the benefit here for filtering is that this you means can leave your data on disk a .leveldb in google-chrome and .sqlite database for firefox and filter out unnecessary records either as a pre-filter step or filter in itself

10490791
int	chars
the stack array must be an int as the pid can be larger than a chars variable can fit my pid was 25689

10490797
hide	show
you can show or hide elements by using

10490812
imagemagick	libtiff
there is imagemagick which does handle tiff images you can pull the metadata using the framework it uses libtiff underneath using this you should be able to pull the metadata tags using calls to tiffgetfield like ed s

10490820
google-chrome	firefox
decoding from google-chrome firefox is fine but i m consistently having a problem sending data from the server to the client google-chrome 18 websockets 13

10490828
stdout	stderr
that first redirects stdout to stderr whatever it was initially -- probably the terminal and then redirects stderr to tmp test

10490828
stdout	stderr
so stdout will be left pointing at whatever stderr was originally pointed at and not at the file

10490828
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to the file first and then redirect stdout to the same place

10490851
google-chrome	firefox
currently google-chrome and ie do display a multiline text in span element but firefox doesn t it just concatenates several lines into 1

10490851
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 12 ie 9 google-chrome 18

10490857
arraylist	treeset
convert the arraylist into a treeset

i d rather add an index on qid if i m going do leverage it - that is if i have some queries filtering or sorting on that field or if i have some joins on that field

10490900
post	get
in case of inputs you have no control over get post parameters api responses you could either use or use casting

10490969
ienumerable	icollection
i tried using icollection instead of ienumerable

10490997
inherited	properties
you need to set the height css properties on the parent if you want the child to inherited it

10491002
inherited	subclassing
says that a subclassing does not inherited the private members of its parent class.

10491002
accessor	superclass	inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
also my computer science book baron s ap computer science a has the correct answer to a question that says that the subclassing inherited all the private instance variables and public accessor methods from the superclass .

10491017
google-chrome	firefox
interestingly google-chrome matches firefox when you use the white-space pre-wrap style.

10491017
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome with white-space style

10491021
accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
remember that the accessor runs in the context of the superclass and so the accessor will be able to see the member that s hidden from the subclassing

10491021
inherited	subclassing
the subclassing inherited the private members in the sense that they are actually there inside instances of the subclassing so they ll take up memory etc. but the subclassing will be unable to directly access them

10491029
button	checkbox
i have a number of checkbox that i want to handle them as toggle button

a problem is np-hard if an oracle for it would make solving np-complete problems easy solvable in polynomial time

10495552
np-hard	np-complete
for example obviously every oracle that solves the halting problem can also solve an np-complete problem so every turing-complete problem is also np-hard in the sense that a fast oracle for it would make solving np-complete problems a breeze

you cannot clip the background in css if the sprite is tight other option would be to add a span next to the input box and set the background to the sprite and the height and width correctly then use the background position to get the correct image once this is done you can then position the span using a minus left value to pull it to the left over the text box hope this helps

i suggested to take advantage of the object-oriented design already in place for the application forms they all inherited from the same custom ancestor object so i planned to insert an initialization method there to dynamically attach onmouseup events to the controls that are declared to support it in subclassing

it still seems to me that if you stack some nsview s vertically inside a superview and set up the constraints such that the top subview is pinned to the top of the superview and going down the stack of subviews you pin each one s top to the bottom edge of the one above and then finally you pin the bottom edge of the last subview to the bottom edge of the superview and you then programmatically resize one or more of the subviews it should be able to pull up or push down on the bottom of the superview to keep it hugging its subviews

hide	show
i would suggest you use jquery to show hide the elements

10504681

you have to set the padding property to 0 because the width and height you provide are too small and therefore are messing with the center value you provide for iconalign

10512202
width	height
one way to see it is to increase to width and height to say 100x50 then you will get a centered icon without touching the padding property..

10512207

however when we add in effects such as fadein and fadeout the effects of the latency become quite clear

10512637
fadein	fadeout
thus the fadein and fadeout events fire as soon as the dom element is added to the dom not when the image is done loading

10512637
fadein	fadeout
in other words the fadein or fadeout actions occur while the image is still being downloaded

10512637
fadein	fadeout
with the image being cached by the browser the latency is greatly reduced and the fadein fadeout effects appear as they should

some considerations about performance of strncpy compared to memcpy

10513169
memcpy	strncpy
memcpy will always be faster than strncpy for any real world situation even in the corner case i spoke before look page_copy_fwd_maybe

xslt	schematron
the xslt code that you ve linked to is generated using schematron

10514649

it would be easier to tell why you are getting errors if a you told us what the errors are and b you showed us the schematron schema rather than the xslt code that it generates

10514740
jar	war
not sure about your first question but as for your second specify the postgresql jar as provided scope in your main dependency block this will prevent it from being bundled in the war and add an additional dependency block in the jetty plugin definition with compile scope which will make the postgresql jar available at jetty runtime

10514740

i don t want to use the src main webapp web-inf lib to place the postgresql jar which is called by jetty for the datasource postegresql-driver because it would be embeded in the application and i don t want it to be in the war client side

10515426
free	malloc
a common approach is to over-ride malloc free with a macro

10515426
free	malloc
to track how much memory is being free in free one option is to allocate an extra field on every malloc call to store the size allocated which you can then check when you free

10515426
free	malloc
or you could just dump the malloc free pointers to file and write a script to post-process and line them up

10515756
free	malloc
and the other solution that would be feasible is the one mentioned by happydave and the one i would not recommend is of redefing the malloc and free functions so that when you call malloc free it records the parameters that you are interested in

10515777

10515856
implements	extends
i m not sure i 100 grasp your problem but from the first few lines of your description instead of implements an interface you could define an abstract class and have your classes extends it

10515890
implements	extends
since you are extends a jlabel you should implements the interface on both classes

10515897

to avoid these error pop-up from appearing select exceptions from the debug menu from visual studio window and in the exception dialog box select the managed debugging assistants exception node

10516245
zoo	xts
you never could subtract xts zoo objects with non-overlapping indices

10516245
zoo	xts
i can replicate the second issue but i m not sure this should be a high priority to fix because it doesn t fit the zoo xts idiom and would result in a completely empty xts object

10516280
svg	vml
my initial thought was to use a combination of foreignobject for svg and direct html with vml for ie

10516280
svg	vml
using overlay that aren t children of the svg vml container feels wrong

10516391
mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
a way round it might be to abandon mouseleave mouseenter and bind a mousemove event to the document

10516391
mouseleave	mouseenter
that might be enough though you could extend that to then trigger mouseleave mouseenter events yourself directed at the animating element

10516405
post	get
i have a problem getting the device imei in j2me i have tried all the strings in those post and also case sensitive but i always get null

equals	icomparable
icomparable equals icomparable other

10516883
int	double
as i understand when you cast between 2 of these types with an arithmetic operation in java for example double + int the result will be as the bigger type meaning in this example the result will be double

the addition and subtraction operators for numeric types + and -

10516939
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
yes nit is right this is the way to customize the uinavigationcontroller but if you don t want to do it for every uiviewcontroller you have you can create a uiviewcontrollerbase class which is a subclass of uiviewcontroller and in viewdidload method set all your buttons the way nit has described and then make every uiviewcontroller you have to be a subclass of your uiviewcontrollerbase class

10516967

pop-up	dialog
i have a form with two modal pop-up dialog forms

10517014
getter	setter
these are just simple data structures with a bunch of getter and setter and no behavior

10517014
getter	setter
getter and setter are too dumb to be tested unless they encapsulate some kind of conditional logic which is rarely the case with dto s

10517058
width	height
all of these could potentially affect the overall width and height and browsers may have different default values

10517066
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
keep a way to force installation of an old versioning in parallel of the current one so do not upgrade

10517066

10517223
min	max
bz i want to draw the shapes for only max and min values in the linechart

10517228
ienumerable	ienumerator
another idea could be to convert the result type of the method from ienumerable to ienumerator

10517245
reportlab	xhtml2pdf
if you cannot achieve the results you need with xhtml2pdf i suggest you use reportlab directly

10517245
reportlab	xhtml2pdf
this isn t to say that xhtml2pdf is bad just that it s going to take time for it to be as good as rendering in a browser and if pdf output for its own sake is what you really are interested in i think using reportlab directly is a better choice

10517253
draggable	droppable
if you are using jquery draggable droppable ui.draggable should be what you re looking for

10517253
draggable	droppable

10517265
google-chrome	safari
ie8 ie9 current versions of google-chrome and safari

portrait	landscape
upon further investigation it seems that the ipad looks at the rotation information from exif data on the image and determining it should be displayed in landscape instead of portrait which is what it really needs to be

10517363
getter	setter
this can be used when a property s getter and setter contain extra actions that you don t want to occur when nhibernate is populating or reading the object

10517363
accessor	properties
this can be used when a properties only exposes a get accessor because the consumers of your api can t change the value directly

10517378
keydown	keyup
one disadvantage is that keydown is a step behind keyup when you re doing the value collecting i m doing but in my setting this is only a minor issue

10517378
keydown	keyup
the difference in behavior appears odd to me when you press four keys at a time the keyup displays the same caret position for all of them while keydown is showing four separate caret positions

10517385
put	get
notable is that i couldn t get reflection working which would normally be the early bound way to do late binding best thing to do is put this code in a separate source code file so you can compile that with option strict off in effect

10517393
lxml	beautifulsoup
for this type of thing i d recommend an html parser like beautifulsoup or lxml in conjunction with a specialized css parser

10517436
submit	submission
so i was considering going with 2 views where the top 2 buttons would act like a submit creating a post request with the form data but not actually submission it to the database

10517436
post	get
i just can t get my head around how to create those 2 buttons to store the post data and then have the final submit button use the previous post data and then other form data to create a new combined post data to store in the database

10517506
prepare	execute
prepare statements combined with stored procedures have a better performance if the same query is execute multiple times with other data inside it

i have not tried it but if you are using http transport you might be able to use some standard http proxy load balancer like nginx or lighttpd

10517579
width	height
if you want to use empty td-s instead of spacers you should provide width and height as well like this

10517603

10517804
folder	directory
the views folder should be under the root directory that is the place where viewengine looks for the views

10517834
pull	push
you must move to the master branch git checkout master do a git pull then move back to whatever branch you are working on git checkout whateverbranch and now you should be able to do a push without problems

10517842
pull	push
additionally i have skimmed the mercurial documentation and i still may not be entirely clear about the full commit update push pull branch merge concept

10517870
folder	directory
currently i have set up on our local ubuntu server using wildcard dns a directory with folder each folder contains a project

10517877

10517882
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i can t say for sure without seeing your jsp code if this is what is happening or not but i actually did have the issue of an action executing twice in ie and only once in firefox google-chrome and opera

10517882
submit	submission
so be sure and check that you aren t accidentally submission the form twice by calling a javascript submit on top of a normal html

10517889
tabs	tabpanel
in generally they are used for layout and only rarely have data associated with them directly - the disclosurepanel for example can have data in the header and the tabpanel s tabs

10517901
cpu	processors
the only time that forking the executable 6 times will earn a performance boost is if you have at least 6 cpu cores and your application is cpu bound -- mostly doing processors operations

hide	show
i have borrowed all the code from there except for the show and hide functions and made a couple for myself

10518049

10518261
udp	tcp
udp is a much more lightweight version of tcp ip

10518261
udp	tcp
thus you normal tcp ip connection will not be able to work on the udp server

10518261
udp	tcp
i would suggest that you convert the quote of the moment server from udp to tcp ip server as this will give you some practise in creating a tcp ip server without getting into too much detail

10518269
for-loop	loops
both use a for-loop to loops through all the characters a mod operation on a non-integer number and a bitwise xor operation

10518272
min	max
if the start and end times are entered by the user you should first convert the string values into timespan objects then you could use a more flexible method which takes date min time and max time as parameters

10518273
google-chrome	firefox
this worked fine in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

10518317
direct3d	bitblt
you may get some traction through using direct3d to tell you when vsync s occur et al so you can bitblt update at a good time

10518317
bitblt	gdi
see gdi vsync to avoid tearing though getting things down to a single small bitblt may be good enough for some cases

10518317
bitblt	gdi
also note that it appears that gdi bitblt isn t synchronized with screen vsync

this is due to the height of the first element pushing the third element across in firefox but not in google-chrome

10518865

10518865
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave
you can use ie s mouseenter and mouseleave instead of the standard mouseover and mouseout in order to achieve a consistent behavior

10518881
rss	feed
you are not allowed to manipulate collections however add remove items so if your rss feed contain nested collections that you want to bind to you need to hoist the whole update to the ui thread ahead of time

width	height
the function i was looking to override is onmeasure int widthspec int heightspec which is called by the parent with suggestions for width and height see view.measurespec

10522282
width	height
then when onmeasure gets called i can compute the available aspect ratio and set the width and height of my view as desired

10522282
width	height
the problem with the relativelayout is that it would not negotiate the width height in a way that allowed me to fix the aspect ratio

10522282
width	height
onmeasure gets called multiple times during measuring and the way relativelayout works is that it first asks the custom view for it s width without telling it the available height and then later comes back and asks for the height while the width is locked to what you specified in the first pass measurespec.exactly

10522282
width	height
this makes it impossible to generate a view of a certain ratio as you must confirm the width before knowing the available height

10522282
width	height
this means i was free to change the width and height during every pass of onmeasure and so i could end up calculating my aspect ratio as desired given the available area

windows	wow64
all 64-bit versions of windows include a 32-bit compatibility layer called windows on windows 64 wow64

10535724
x86	64bit
however compiling for 64bit x64 does mean that your app will not run on a 32-bit x86 machine

10535724
x86	64bit
that will allow the application to run as a 32-bit application x86 on a 32-bit machine and as a 64bit application x64 on a 64bit machine

unfortunately afaik that is not possible with pbs torque - the stdout stderr streams are locally spooled on the execution host and then transferred to the submit host after the job has finished

10539215

10539450
pull	push
so pull and push in that branch will pull and pull from to the remote master branch

10539491
decoder	encoder
the decoder runs an exact duplicate of the encoder necessarily delayed with respect to the original including its encoding interval model

10539491
decoder	encoder
the decoder also keeps track of the known output interval of the encoder up to the point at which it has read the compressed datastream

10539491
decoder	encoder
since the encoding intervals are all discretized this unit output interval is guaranteed to fit into some encoding interval so the decoder can never fall too far behind the encoder

10539491
decoder	encoder
however the end of a compressed stream may require a flush of the decoder state -- either by some auxiliary signal like a file length or by the encoder sending enough extra bits to ensure that the decoder finds its termination symbol

i tried to search for malloc and free algorithm and heap structure but i couldn t find anything helpful

10540845

10540973
exponent	modulo
either you have to decode the pkcs#8 encoded blob yourself asn.1 ber parsing and set the components or you can get the components from the private key at least the private exponent and modulo as java bigintegers convert those to unsigned byte arrays and set them in the java card api as explained by robert

10540977
children	parent
the described project is not a multi-module project in a sense that parent pom is not referring it s children via

10540991
free	malloc
when a block is returned by malloc an internal data structure is created so that when that exact block is passed to free it will be recognized and linked into a free list

10540991
free	malloc
well except for the cases where the neighboring addresses were actually needed. using larger blocks will also result in less internal fragmentation which may actually use less memory overall in the steady-state where malloc and free calls are balanced in a long-running process

10540994
free	malloc
after you malloc a memory block it has to be held in order to know how much to free when free is called and a pointer to the next block has to be kept in order to find them all and to chain them together

10541033
width	height
you should take into account that after layouting some field the available width and height left for layouting gets smaller in your case because you are layouting your fields horizontally mostly the width matter

10541033
width	height
another thing is that you want to call the setextent method with the width and height you actually used for layouting your fields and not the maximum width and height received in sublayout unless you are doing it intentionally because of some specific ui layout logic

10541043
width	height
then in css give it position fixed and display none and z-index 9999 along with the width and height you desire

10541043

serializable	deserialization
when you want to store python objects that aren t text aren t easily serializable with other libraries json msgpack etc and don t want to write your own serializable and deserialization code

10542398
serializable	deserialization
generally speaking pickle should be a serializable and deserialization method of last resort it isn t speedy msgpack is far faster and more compact isn t secure don t ever use pickle as a storage format for cookies or other client-accessible data

hide	show
i m seeing an issue in ie8 where i have a container div that fails to calculate its height correctly when hiding showing child elements ul inside of it using hide and show

10544020
width	height
our modules need to have a refresh method called each time something in the module need to adjust the height width of the module this is because they need a fixed height to render it correctly

10544020
hide	show
i found out if i replace all the hide show with a .addclass display-none .removeclass display-none where .display-none display none

10544020
hide	show
however i was hoping for a css solution where i can still use show and hide some rule or ie issue hack i don t know about

10544020
hide	show
the items i am hiding and showing are groups of node from an in house built tree widget which is made up of nested unordered list aka the hide and show are being applied to s

10544020

to implements your own seekbar you first create a customseekbar class that extends absseekbar

10544177
hash	md5
to give more of a guarantee of uniqueness a stronger hash function such as md5 would be more ideal but just has the slight inconvenience that the resulting hash codes are too wide to store in a primitive

10544177
hash	md5
md5 gives you a much much stronger guarantee at the expense of wider hash codes.

10544184
multicastdelegate	delegation
events in .net are all based around multicastdelegate s and every delegation in .net is a multicastdelegate

10544184

we can now use a preorder traversal or a breadth-first traversal to print the nodes in an order you want as long as we output the parent nodes before the children we will be fine

usually you won t be using an objectcontext or a dbcontext in your controller classes anyway so in an earlier layer business or service layer you can do a quick translation from the objects coming from the db into viewmodel style objects similar to what you d do in an mvc app but instead of passing them on to a view you return them to the caller

10556335

you could get the yourkit java profiler which is also available for evaluation

10556482
public	protected
edit i just checked up on this oak called it private but it behaved like java s package-private all classes in a particular package can use all variables and methods declared in the classes in that package regardless of public protected and private declarations. oak 0.2 spec page 15 anyway the date on that would be at least 1994 version 0.2 of the spec probably earlier

10556609
uiapplication	uiwindow
i wonder if you can do something this way by subclassing uiapplication or uiwindow and override the sendevent method

10556616
children	parent
you should be able to simply cast v to a linearlayout then access its children just like you did with its parent

10556616
inherited	subclassing
that would allow you to potentially use different kinds of layout containers as children if needed as they are subclassing of viewgroup which is where they inherited getchildat and getchildcount from

10557224
post	get
that spring puts the objects specified by sessionattributes into the session only for the duration between the first get request and the post request that comes after it

10557224
post	get
so if you want to have objects that last longer throughout multiple get and post requests you will have to add them manually to the httpsession as usual

mouseleave	mouseenter
however jstree also depends on mouseenter and mouseleave for drop target checking and i don t have an event for those

10557432
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve been thinking about trying to generate the mouseenter and mouseleave events from the touchmove event by looking at the coordinates and checking for overlap but i haven t tried that yet

10557432
mouseleave	mouseenter
