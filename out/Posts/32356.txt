70046
jsf	seam
they basically abstract all the sql jpa in a seam component that jsf can easily use

70083
installation	upgrade
there are plenty of 3rd-party addons for different payment-providers and other things and the built-in download-manager handles the installation of these as well as upgrade to the core code really well

70136
hash	md5
2 in a client-server aplication with direct connection with the db to compare the user sent password to the application not the db user password hash with md5 so that the password not travel by the net in plain text

70204
client-side	server-side
you can either do this server-side or client-side

70261
vb6	vba
unfortunately you can t use a vb6 vba function as a callback directly as vb6 only generates stdcall functions rather than the cdecl functions sqlite expects

70275
128bit	64bit
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p 64bit vector of input values vector a - 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 0g 0h 0i 0j 0k 0l 0m 0n 0o 0p 128bit vector of indices vector b

70296
hide	show
however if you remove the parameter to application.run then the application will be started with no form show and you will be free to show and hide forms as much as you like

70299
daemons	systemd
on the systemd you are initiating the transfer from you can run an ssh-agent daemons and add the private half of the key to the agent

70375
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

70375
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

70375
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

70384
vim	emacs
vim is rapidly turning into the emacs of the new century

70402
quicksort	mergesort
they re both o nlogn and yet most people use quicksort instead of mergesort

70421
mergesort	in-place
is in-place mergesort requires extra memory linear to number of elements to be sorted

70423
quicksort	heapsort
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

70427
quicksort	mergesort
i m a bigger fan of mergesort than i am of quicksort for these reasons

70428
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort and heapsort and can be

70430
quicksort	mergesort
i think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for mergesort which is î n that quicksort implementations don t have

70440
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

70440
quicksort	mergesort
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

70440
quicksort	mergesort
i personally often will use mergesort or a quicksort variant that degrades to mergesort when quicksort does poorly

70452
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
i d like to add that of the three algoritms mentioned so far mergesort quicksort and heapsort only mergesort is stable

70471
getter	setter
however i can also swear that i have seen property getter setter code in java in one codebase but i cannot remember where

70501
regasm	tlbexp
when using regasm or tlbexp from the .net 2.0 sdk to create a com type library for the containing assembly i get the following warning

70522
public	protected
therefore the rule of thumb is to try to define static nested class with as limited scope as possible private class protected public and then convert it to inner class by removing static identifier and loosen the scope if it s really necessary

70527
getter	setter
if you re using eclipse then it has the capabilities to auto generate the getter and setter method for the internal attributes it can be a usefull and timesaving tool

70531
loops	if-statement
shell for simple batching of commands with perhaps a loops or an if-statement

70535
getter	setter
there is a standard pattern for getter and setter in java called bean properties

70548
getter	setter
most ides for java will automatically generate getter and setter code for you if you want them to

70548
getter	setter
eclipse even includes automated refactoring that will allow you to wrap a property up in a getter and setter and it will modify all the code that accesses the property directly to make it use the getter and or setter

70561
switching	screens
if it s an old crt imac then you can t switching off the screens without switching the computer off - the convection from the crt is used to cool the processor

70627
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

70653
django	turbogears
i have found several method in web framework such as django or turbogears

70687
implements	extends
such a declaration creates a new instance of an unnamed class which extends object and implements interfacename

70687
implements	extends
if you want a local inner class which implements multiple interfaces or which implements interfaces while extends some class other than object or which specifies its own constructor you re stuck creating a regular named local inner class

70723
yacc	bison
yacc bison definitely gives you a leg up since good linting would require parsing the program

70772
treemap	linkedhashmap
if you want a reliable iteratior order there s linkedhashmap and treemap

70848
openbsd	linux
in linux and openbsd popen produces unidirectional pipes which are read-only or write-only

70848
freebsd	netbsd
on os x freebsd and netbsd popen produces bidirectional pipes

70851
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	division	exponent	exponent	addition	multiplication	exponent	addition	multiplication
the traditional bodmas brackets orders division multiplication addition subtraction or pedmas parentheses exponent division multiplication addition subtraction are just subsets of all the possible operations and denote the order that such operations should be applied in

70881
addition	multiplication
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

70900
superclass	subclassing
the name scrambling is used to ensure that subclassing don t accidentally override the private methods and attributes of their superclass

70916
jruby	rubinius
the work done by the jruby and rubinius teams in creating a ruby spec is probably the most important outcome so far as it will help ensure that all implementations remain compatible

70945
yacc	bison
antlr looks to be an alternative path to the more common ok i heard about them before yacc bison approach which it turns out also commonly use lex flex as a front end

70991
width	height
you ll encounter a very subtle problem here because most video and audio formats especially in ordinary containers use global headers meaning at the start of the file they have a single header which specifies compression information like width height etc for the whole file

71065
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix	solaris	irix
we have a collection of commercial mfc c++ applications which we sell using stingray objective toolkit we have source code license and have ported it in the past to solaris irix hp-ux aix using bristol technologies windu windows api on unix including mfc

71105
verilog	hdl
ladder logic can be transformed to one of the modern hdl s like verilog

71118
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in almost all browsers firefox ie google-chrome but whenever the page is opened in ie it prompts javascript error like

71150
folder	directory
i just found it out myself if you add a trailing backslash to the project folder setting changing it from c dev to c dev the vsmacros80 directory will no longer be created

71152
prepare	execute
it offers features like prepare + execute emulation for dbs that don t support it properly and allows you to use placeholders which is good practice to avoid sql injection problems

71152
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	informix
it will work with mysql mysqli postgresql postgresql oci8 oracle sqllite msql mssql microsoft sql server sybase informix fbsql ibase odbc

71171
ant	cruisecontrol	nant	cruisecontrol
you might want to use a combination of cruisecontrol or cruisecontrol.net and ant or nant

71190
nunit	mstest
you can unit test your clr code inside of vs using any of the standard unit testing frameworks nunit mstest and you don t have to write a bunch of set up and tear down scripts that can be difficult to manage

71196
ubuntu	linux
i use it with eclipse in linux ubuntu and fedora core windows xp and mac os x.5

71214
free	malloc
it emulates your program and intercepts calls to malloc free etc

71242
google-chrome	safari
there are anti-aliasing differences between safari 3.1 and google-chrome for whatever that s worth

71322
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox opera safari google-chrome all work

71336
notepad++	jedit
jedit was kinda big in 2004 but now notepad++ seems to have taken the lead on windows

71397
vim	emacs
you can easily do things in vim in the normal course of editing that would require you to drop down to scripting in emacs

71406
bazaar	git
at least hg bazaar and git can use external merge utilities

71412
emacs	jedit
other than that i m quite happy with jedit - it s the best general editor i ve found so far for linux ducks as hordes of vi and emacs users light up their flame cannons

71475
folder	directory
when the user clicks one of the those items the contents of the related directory are zipped in place and the resulting zip file is stored in a cache folder

71477
google-chrome	firefox
strangely firefox google-chrome does not prompt error but ie does which is bit different than what it used to be

71482
put	get
put on some music close down your email and get busy

71491
rss	feed
the most difficult part i think is extraction of meaningful information from web pages if it isn t available as rss or atom feed

71511
google-chrome	firefox
sorry firefox google-chrome both report this error but in very silent way

71511
google-chrome	firefox
you need to go to firefox 3.0 javascript errors dialog to see if is there any error and for google-chrome you need to go to javascript console

71511
google-chrome	firefox
in my view there should be at least some ui indications like icon would turn red for such errors in firefox 3.0 as well as google-chrome

71582
jboss	glassfish
if you need to support more than one app server or eventually want the option to move from jboss to glassfish etc. you will essentially be carrying your container spring with you rather than relying on compatibility between different implementations of the ejb3 specification

71642
textmate	jedit
i also paid for textmate and ultraedit at different times both very good but in the end jedit comes out on top for me

71743
tapestry	sitemesh
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page

71743
tapestry	sitemesh
tapestry components can take other components as parameters which allows the sitemesh style wrapping

71750
opera	safari
fyi this hack only targets safari 3 and also targets opera 9

71786
notepad++	jedit
the most highly recommended editors are jedit and notepad++

71790
httphandler	httpmodule
you could use an httphandler instead of an httpmodule

71794
mktime	strftime
if you want to continue with awk then the mktime and strftime functions are useful

71815
kate	nano
until now all work on the codebase has been done purely with nano or perhaps kate

71826
versioning	upgrade
firstly the different versioning of oracle you re using is the reason for the table statistics error - i had the same issue when some of our oracle 10g databases got upgrade to release 2 and some were still on release 1 and i was swapping .dmp files between them

71892
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari
if you are trying to make a site cross browser compliant i d recommend writing the site to look good in safari firefox opera using correct css and then making changes for ie using conditional css includes in ie

71929
ndepend	fxcop
corey my answer of using fxcop had assumed you were interested in removing unused private members however to solve the problem with other cases you can try using ndepend

71937
rss	feed
email co-workers scrums rss feed twitter lunch coffee breaks etc

71970
post	get
when you want to display your front page you just get the top n post from your database based on that score

71977
notepad++	jedit	emacs	jedit
something like vi is great emacs is also fine or if you absolutely must be on windows something like notepad++ or jedit will be decent

71987
client-side	server-side
it has a good client-side and server-side api and it provides a progress bar for big file uploads

72006
n-gram	words
there are a few ways you can also pay some attention to n-gram strings of two or more words kept in order

72035
post	get
here s a couple blog post to get you started down the path

72073
width	height
i found that setting height 0 width 0 worked the same as hidden true and solved the problem

72126
metaclass	subclassing
you could then wrap this up in a metaclass to make it easier for people who are subclassing

72129
inherited	properties
if this is a user control i would recommend renaming the properties so you don t hide the inherited member

72444
free	malloc
i ve changed the code to use malloc free

72464
google-chrome	safari
in safari the password label and input box are directly below the email label and input box while in google-chrome the password label and input box are indented approximately 75 pixels to the right

72543
cruisecontrol	teamcity
change cruisecontrol for jetbrains teamcity

72586
ant	emma
better to just use emma on its own via ant if required

72599
int	chars
if all that is visible is the forward declaration the translation unit can t know what storage size will have been chosen - it could be a chars or an int or something else

72633
int	double
but as you already have a working c# code porting it to actionscript might requires a redesign due to actionscript having a different way of thinking programming they use different primitive data types for example they use just a number instead of int float double etc

72651
pop-up	dialog
you then have the choice of showing just a small pop-up window below the property area or a full blown dialog box

72658
eurekalog	madexcept
there do exist a few libraries that can help you in analyzing runtime exceptions like madexcept jcldebug and eurekalog

72698
int	chars
the ascii int code for these chars would be out of the normal alphabetic ranges

72709
eurekalog	madexcept
as previous commenters wrote you can also add a mother of all exception handlers like madexcept or eurekalog to catch the uncaught

72760
unsigned	short
in visual studio 2008 you may get a compiler error because bstr is defined as a pointer to unsigned short while wchar_t is a native type

72826
getter	setter
basically it generates a superclass with the getter setter and many other code generation options

72888
capitalize	substr
however if you are not working with a .net langauge then it depends on what the input looks like - if you have two separate fields for the first name and the last name then you can just capitalize the first letter lower the rest of it using substr

72942
stdout	stderr
enable tracing logging in all third party apps and libraries you are using such that the errors are logged to files instead of stdout or stderr

72951
versioning	upgrade
i did and i even upgrade from 2.x versioning to 3.x

73003
object-pascal	delphi
i know i m being a stickler but delphi is the ide object-pascal is the language and vcl is the graphical framework

73008
submit	submission
unfortunately we can t submit the information in chunks during each form submission so we have to store it the users session until the end of the process and submit it all at the same time

73021
ada	pascal
in c++ ada pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference you can actually change the variable that was passed

73065
mouseover	mousedown
this has the advantage that normal win32 forms functionality will continue to work such as taskbar-flashing of the form when you click on one of its modal dialogs or the management of mouseover mousedown events would still work normally etc

73101
google-chrome	safari
i ve got a psp it has a browser that s based on webkit also google-chrome and safari use webkit engine so pretty any site that works fine on safari google-chrome will work fine on psp

73101
opera	safari
so generally if you want to target mobile devices you will have to make sure your ecommerce website works fine in small resolutions it doesn t use activex since it won t work on iphone safari opera mini and psp browser etc

73104
client-side	server-side
it depends on whether you want to do client-side or server-side paging

73109
innodb	myisam
the error shows up using both myisam and innodb table engines

73112
public	protected
public protected and then private and within each section alphabetically although i often list constructor first and deconstructor last

73134
free	malloc
would i be better off changing this code to use malloc and free instead

73150
snmp	mib
if that is not possible then it is okay to use oids as they should not change per the snmp mib guidelines

73150
snmp	mib
this is obvious but be sure to look at the attributes of the snmp mib variable

73157
free	malloc
yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructors

73195
getter	setter
getter and setter are uninteresing mostly so there is no need to read them

73202
yacc	bison
bison is readily available and at least on linux yacc is usually implemented as bison

73219
free	malloc
just small addition if you don t have any constructor or and distructors so you basically need allocate and free a chunk of raw memory consider using free malloc pair

73295
free	malloc
rather than switching to malloc free if only because it s a simpler change to make without making mistakes

73295
free	malloc
so i guess it s probably as easy to switch to malloc free after all

73318
class-method	delegation
creating an object of type delegation actually creates a variable which can hold functions -- be they lambdas static methods or class-method

73352
width	height
if you really want the image to stretch to fit you can go a little further and add an image into that div and define its style to fit width height 100

73381
hide	show
then simply hide the part that is filled out and show the next part of the form.

73418
xslt	xquery
you can tell tidy to generate xhtml which is a type of xml which means you can use all the usual xml tools like xslt and xquery on the results

73519
boost	stl
i would like to remove stl boost debug symbols from libraries and executable for two reasons

73519
boost	stl
debugging jumps into stl boost code which is annoying

73574
ssl	https
ssl..or rather https http over ssl sends all http content over ssl and as http content and headers are in fact the same thing this means the headers are encrypted as well

73574
post	get
seeing as get and post data is sent via http headers then it only makes sense then when sending data securely you wouldn t just want the response code or content to be encrypted

73621
ethernet	wireless
you need to have a default route which would either be your ethernet or wireless

73670
tunnel	vpn
one caveat with modifying routes - vpn tunnel are not too happy about chnages in static routes once the vpn is set up so be sure to set it up at windows boot up after the nics are initialized through some scripting

73670
tunnel	vpn
static routes- these will work fine unless you are using a vpn tunnel

73688
tolower	toupper
so you are gonna have to call toupper on the first char and tolower on the remaining characters

73722
ssl	https
yes if you are using the https http over ssl protocol instead of plain http

73745
put	get
after a couple years i don t get all the files off that i put on them

73747
getter	setter
it will be true for property getter and setter

73750
spaces	delimiter
i have two functions one is called numstringparts which returns the number of parts in a string with a specific delimiter in your case above the spaces and getstrpart returns the specific part from a string with a specific delimiter

73763
serializable	deserialization
when you also want to be able to serializable your object you need to make sure that deserialization won t create a copy

73863
cvs	rcs
because cvs uses rcs it can only store successive full copies of a changing binary file

73870
client-side	server-side
your choice depends on several different factors including whether you want the work done client-side most javascript frameworks or server-side echo2 etc.

73915
inherited	properties
if the properties you try is inherited or overridden from object then this works for any class

73946
vsto	add-in
the advantage to a range becomes apparent when you are working with large amounts of data because vsto add-in are hosted outside the boundaries of the excel application itself so all calls to excel have to be passed through a layer with overhead

73986
postgresql	mysql
you can start with a desktop tool like microsoft access or use the free sql server express or postgresql or mysql

74003
kde	gnome
gnome will generally look in the kde icon directory to see if there are other icons there also..

74063
submit	submission
when they submit the score you can check they ve actually got an open game and they re not submission a score too soon or too large

74236
free	malloc
looking at the source it appears that someone did a search and replace for malloc and free and the above is the result

74288
width	height
this fills out a provided xwindowattributes structure which includes integers for the x and y position of the window as well as its width and height and other useful facts

74316
int	chars
if possible i try to match my source code file with me header files but generally it s if void a uses int b chars foo than int b chars foo comes first

74327
free	malloc
this is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc free

74368
gmail	hotmail
i am trying to create an email two column flexible layout which works in outlook 07 i have created a successful version in outlook 03 hotmail gmail yahoo and aol in both ie and mozilla firefox however when testing in outlook 07 it strips out my float left css

74372
solaris	aix
i am involved in the process of porting a system containing several hundreds of ksh scripts from aix solaris and hpux to linux

74372
solaris	aix
on aix solaris and hpux the output is flag true on linux the output is flag false

74372
solaris	aix
on aix solaris and hpux ksh is a variant of ksh88

74372
solaris	aix
on aix solaris and hpux dtksh and ksh93 where i have them installed are consistent with ksh

74372
solaris	aix
on aix solaris and linux bash is consistent giving the incorrect from my perspective result of flag false

74406
postgresql	mysql
starting with a proper database like oracle or sql server or mysql postgresql if you are looking for free options is a good idea

74409
svg	vml
i m starting to think that it would be a simpler though less flexible to just use the free svg continent maps on wikipedia convert them to png and create an image map of all the countries - then use canvas and vml to draw an element on top of the countries - but this just seems like a huge pain and very error-prone compared to a flash solution

74425
rss	feed
probably the easiest solution is to just have the images uploaded to flickr edited in picnik built into flickr now and then loaded onto the users site using either the flickr rss feed or apis

74446
solaris	aix
aix and solaris use versions of the original ksh so the kornshell.org version is usually feature- and bug- complete

74446
solaris	sunos
having cut my teeth with sunos solaris installing kornshell.org ksh is usually one of the first things i do on a new linux box.

74448
hash	salt
this page returns two values a randomly generated salt value and a cryptographic hash of that salt value combined with the shared secret

74448
hash	salt
the flash game combines the salt value with the shared secret and calculates a hash to verify that this matches the one provided by the server

74448
hash	salt
the flash game combines the salt value with the shared secret high score value and any other relevant information nickname ip timestamp and calculates a hash

74448
post	get
it then sends this information back to the php backend via http get or post along with the salt value high score and other information

74483
inherited	properties
phrogram includes support for class-based programming with methods and properties - but that s only encapsulation not inherited or polymorphism

74605
hash	salt
this was a common issue in unix many years ago and was resolved by separating the user identity components username uid shell full name etc. from the authentication components password hash password hash salt

74612
width	margin
edit unfortunately i can t hard-code the width as i m dynamically generating the html and it includes nesting the divs recursively inside each other with left margin on each div this creates a nice nested effect

74668
fortify	checkmarx
these include fortify and ouncelabs expensive and for many languages visualstudio.net codeanalysis for .net and c++ free with vsts decent but not great owasp s lapse for java free decent not great checkmarx not cheap fantastic tool for .net and java but high overhead and many more

74675
stdout	stderr
the script can print to stdout or stderr and that output should be visible to you in the visual studio build output window the window that usually shows stuff like build 3 succeeded 0 failed

74688
zipoutputstream	zipfile
you can use java s zipfile and zipentry classes to read the contents of a jar file then use zipoutputstream to create a new one

74689
rss	feed
one of the usefull tool is rss feed reader

74715
width	margin
a guideline though is if you set width on an element don t set margin or padding on the same element

74752
rss	feed
like you say most sites have a rss feed today

74752
post	get
get a rss reader that sync between computers if you use more than one computer so you don t have to mark alot of post as read

74756
versioning	upgrade
when you need to upgrade to a new versioning of the library just reference the new file name versioning from the relevant pages

74782
eruby	erb
my plan is to template the config files using embedded ruby via either eruby or erb within the source files to do things like iteratively generate all the interface config blocks for a router these blocks are all very similar differing only in a label and an ip address

74782
eruby	erb
which when run through an embedded ruby interpreter either erb or eruby produces the following output

74807
eruby	erb
erb is pure ruby eruby is written in c so it s a bit faster

74823
eruby	erb
eruby is an external executable while erb is a library within ruby

74823
eruby	erb
it is more common to use erb simply because it is more flexible but i ll admit that i have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute .rhtml files for quick little utility websites

74857
perl	tcl
according to this vim-enhanced is just vim with the perl python tcl and cscope options compiled in. you should be able to find everything you need to know about these compile options in the documentation

74913
width	margin
microsoft lost and now it s either width or margin padding border for an element

74921
jquery	scriptaculous
i tried prototype and scriptaculous first but then switched to jquery and there is no looking back

74931
postgresql	mysql
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

74951
width	height
so i followed the technique suggested and it only works if i explicitly set the width height on the proxy image

74971
yacc	cup
i would imagine you could use tools like lex flex cup antlr or yacc or their equivalents for whatever programming language you are using

74992
bash	zsh
i don t have experience with ksh but i have used both bash and zsh

74992
bash	zsh
i prefer zsh over bash because of its support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab completion

75015
put	get
put all the ideas together and you might get a model-t.

75021
fpdf	fpdi	tcpdf	fpdf	tcpdf	fpdi
so if you want place another pdf inside another dynamically generated pdf document like an image use fpdi + fpdf tcpdf

75051
profiler	yourkit
the yourkit java profiler is an excellent commercial solution

75114
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
most unix systems like solaris aix and hpux have ksh as default

75118
fflush	gets
caveat like with using cfheader cfcontent you need to do this before the cache gets fflush to the browser since it s basically doing the same thing without having to store the file

75166
width	height
the methods for detecting screen width and height are accurate for all handsets in my experience

75185
folder	directory
enter that as the only content in your index.php in your root directory and any requests sent to that folder will then redirect the user to the forum

75193
vim	emacs
i remember when i first started learning emacs it was after i was already very comfortable with vim and i was in the same or similar boat that you were where i knew how to get a lot done in another editor so as i started using emacs it was always painfully slow

75205
put	get
synchronizing via collections.synchronizedxxx won t do good since it does not guarantee iterator safety it only synchronizes writes and reads via put get set .

75238
int	chars
on most platforms signed chars will be an 8-bit two s complement number ranging from -128 to 127 and unsigned chars will be an 8-bit unsigned int 0 to 255

75261
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for jmm

75280
int	chars
if you want to use a chars as a small int the safest way to do it is with the int8_t and uint8_t types

75319
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
in most cases public apis will expose ilist or icollection or ienumerable as appropriate

75491
vim	emacs
you can edit it with emacs or vim or eclipse or whatever you are most comfortable with

75495
width	height
when creating a usercontrol in wpf i find it convenient to give it some arbitrary height and width values so that i can view my changes in the visual studio designer

75495
width	height
when i run the control however i want the height and width to be undefined so that the control will expand to fill whatever container i place it in

75517
wordpress	joomla
you should look into setting up wordpress or some other blogging engine and then simply have joomla consume the content and display it in the joomla site

75527
width	height
this will set the design height and width to 500 and 600 respectively

75574
onenote	ms-office
but if you use ms ms-office you shall explore ms-office onenote

75575
nhibernate	entityspaces
you can generate doodads nhibernate easyobjects entityspaces etc

75590
gif	png	tiff	png
you could also use pdf2ps ps2image and then convert from the resulting image to tiff with other utilities i remember paul paul - yet another image viewer displays png tiff gif jpg etc.

75606
width	height
in visual studio add the width and height attribute to your usercontrol xaml but in the code-behind insert this

75606
width	height
if not runtime it will set the width and height to nan not a number which is the value you set it to if you remove the width and height attributes in xaml

75606
width	height
so at design-time you will have the preset width and height including if you put the user control in a form and at runtime it will dock depending on its parent container

75638
lua	scheme	lisp	scheme
the guys behind lua have repeatedly listed scheme and lisp as major influences on lua and lua has even been described as scheme without the parentheses

75705
dbf	dbase
i have searched for various techniques on how to read write dbase iii dbf files using oledb or odbc with c# .net

75714
int	double
currently i use int double strings and enumerations so the code will have to be adaptive based on the type

75747
sorting	filtering
i d prefer to render each list item as a single cell with complex rendering for instance the way that stackoverflow shows its lists of questions. i d also like to get as much of the sharepoint-standard ui as possible such as the sorting filtering and paging controls

75789
width	margin
i ve never come across a problem caused by using width padding and or margin together

75792
xen	raid
the raid controller in those does not play well with the xen kernel

75798
profiling	debugging
however it s written in python which means there s little real support in the way of deployment packaging debugging profiling and other tools that make building and maintaining applications much easier

75810
postgresql	mysql
same interface so if you like me use oracle ms-sql mysql and postgresql then at least your day to day query management tool will look the same for all platforms

75811
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
summary ie renders width different then the standard rendering if padding and margin used with width or height

75869
post	get
if you relate that to http basically it s either get or post parameters

75883
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer of usually 8 bits

75892
innodb	myisam
postgres is acid-compliant like innodb and when well-tuned nearly as speedy as myisam

75904
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
many common desktops including gnome kde and xfce where relevant implement the specifications laid out by freedesktop.org

75985
versioning	upgrade
if the distro ever comes out with an official package for a newer versioning of some random module it will automatically be installed when you apt-get upgrade

75994
pop-up	dialog
another feature that i find useful is that it can pop-up a dialog box that shows all the js and css scripts used on the page

76040
xna	slimdx
there is also slimdx which is under constant development as a means of providing a lean wrapper of directx in a similar fashion as managed directx which was i believe discontinued by microsoft in favor of xna

76242
width	margin
by setting the width of the table to 100 and it s margin to zero you will remove the space between the borders of the table and it s container

76276
ant	maven
i would assume you run separate build scripts or have separate targets in the same script - ant and maven can both easily handle conditionally grabbing files and copying them

76295
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari
tested and working in firefox 2 safari 3.1.2 for windows ie 6 and opera 9.52

76314
notepad	textpad
opening it up with notepad or textpad just shows a bunch of gobbledy-gook

76334
cos	sin
i generally use gcc and recall that it can calculate certain values at compile-time when all inputs are known ex sin cos etc...

76478
width	margin
from another angle if your parent div does have a width set and the margin is still affecting your table then you are probably in quirks mode

76601
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried ie firefox google-chrome and i do not see the error

76608
ssl	https
it should be https not ssl

76608
ssl	https
can you double check this in your example client and make sure it is https not ssl

76763
procmail	exim
if exim or sendmail is what s writing into the pipe then procmail is a good answer because it ll give you file locking serialization and you can put it all in the same file

76789
innodb	myisam
you need to benchmark your own application myisam vs innodb

76811
put	get	post	get	post	put
the only allowed verbs are get put post and delete

76833
apache	lighttpd
at the very least use apache but if you can use lighttpd or another high-performance webserver

76854
opera	firefox
unfortunately around 45-50 of our client base uses ie6 while the other half are pretty much equally split between firefox and webkit-based browsers with a sprinkling of opera users

76879
integer	fractions
you cast the datetime into a float which represents the date as the integer portion and the time as the fractions of a day that s passed

76925
post	get
ideally i d be able to construct a message and use winhttp to perform a post to a wcf service hosted in iis and get a response but so far i ve been unable to construct something that works properly

76925
post	get
in the 2.0 web service world this was as easy as putting a setting in the web.config to get the service to respond to a post and then calling the appropriate web method with the right parameters

76989
vb6	vba
vba as in what was implemented as part of office 2000 2003 and vb6 have been deprecated in favor of .net technologies

77003
factors	matrix
as you don t have the original projection matrix further ambiguity is introduced by an arbitary scaling factors that exists in any projection

77045
udp	tcp
rather than using raw sockets some applications use a higher numbered tcp or udp port

77055
inherited	properties
you can also inherited the controls into your own classes and set the properties in there

77089
getter	setter
most importantly watch for the existence of setter and getter indicating that you are operating on values from a class and not asking the class to operate on it s own values --or using extends without applying the liskov substitution principle stuff like that

77205
icmp	tcp
useful as icmp packets to an address will not necessarily end up at the same place as a tcp connection to port 80 for example

77208
post	get
if you can get the window handle maybe using findwindow you can send post any message to it as long as the wparam lparam aren t pointers

77232
profiling	benchmarking
you ll have to benchmarking and or profiling your application on production grade hardware to find out

77234
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind memcheck is an excellent free one

77249
ucfirst	capitalize
i don t believe ucfirst satisfies the op s question to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string without splitting the string and joining it later

77250
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
for argumentexception is meant to be used when anything goes wrong with the parameters to a method with the exception of argumentnullexception

77278
solaris	aix
according to its web site it works on windows mac os x linux solaris aix and hp-ux

77278
unix	solaris	solaris	netbsd
based on the test reports it works on the windows mac os x linux netbsd and solaris but theoretically it should work on other unix systems as well

77310
udp	tcp
like udp and tcp this is accessible through the normal sockets api

77310
udp	tcp
only udp and tcp port numbers less than 1024 are protected from use other than by root

77328
textwrangler	bbedit
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more

77359
octal	decimal
putting a std dec indicates decimal numbers std oct indicates octal

77360
octal	hex	octal	decimal
it will be able to parse 10 dec as 10 decimal 0x10 hex as 16 decimal and 010 octal as 8 decimal

77498
atomic	interlocked
on windows interlocked exchange add is guaranteed to be atomic

77593
factors	mean
these factors mean that using a language s built in utilities is just more convenient

77625
innodb	myisam
i ve worked on a high-volume system using mysql and i ve tried both myisam and innodb

77625
innodb	myisam
of course i have no idea what your application is but hopefully this gives you some insight into some of the issues with myisam and innodb

77693
profiling	debugging
debugging profiling and other tools

77693
profiling	debugging
the downside is it s written in php and as far as i know php doesn t have superb tools for debugging profiling and packaging of apps

77699
post	get
the post above mentioning devel prof probably really means devel cover to get the code coverage of a test suite

77709
int	double
allows you to write code which is applicable to many types with the same underlying behaviour a dictionary string int uses the same underlying code as a dictionary datetime double

77724
g++	gcc
i agree with iulian è erbäƒnoiu code blocks is a very good solution usable both from linux it will use g++ gcc and from windows it will use either the ms compiler or gcc

77726
rss	feed
i am coding an rss reader and i believe i made the wrong choice in using xml over a sqlite database to store a cache of all the feed items

77727
bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
bazaar is reasonably fast very fast for trees with shallow history but presently scales poorly with history length and is easy-to-learn to those familiar with the command-line interfaces of traditional scms cvs svn etc

77727
bazaar	perforce	bazaar	git
about the author i use git and perforce for work and bazaar for my personal projects and as an embedded library

77735
int	double
also if you basically have int arithmetic in double here we use double to hold int values in certain cases your arithmetic will be correct

77736
profiler	aqtime
aqtime is also a good code profiler

77748
debian	linux
the server is linux debian 4.0

77834
perforce	cvs
the only real difference between cvs subversion clearcase perforce visualsourcesafe and all the other cvcses is in the workflow performance and integration that each product offers

77883
bazaar	git
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

77885
post	put
as for what to store in a session variable put your data there if you want to refer to it again on another page like a shopping basket but don t put it there if it s just temporary data used for producing the result of this page like a list of tags for the currently viewed post

77943
bazaar	svn
bazaar is the most flexible it has transparent read-write support for svn repositories and cares a lot about the user experience

77945
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is not better than mergesort

77945
quicksort	mergesort
but computers are so fast today that the additional overhead of a mergesort is negligible and the risk of a very slow quicksort far outweighs the insignificant overhead of a mergesort in most cases

77975
gmail	hotmail
also keep in mind many people use webmail such as gmail hotmail yahoo mail etc

78000
post	get
things like what object is being viewed edited should really be get post variables passed around between the screens so a user can use multiple browser windows to work with your application unless you d like to prevent that

78024
postgresql	mysql
i think the only way to know for sure what is going on is to look through the code or get one of the mysql postgresql programmers in here to say how it processes fk constraints

78044
versioning	upgrade
so you have to upgrade mongrel to a versioning that supports --clean to get around the stale pid file issue monit alone can t do this

78055
stateless	stateful
overall it sounds like the current implementation is abusively using session objects to try and simulate a stateful application in a supposedly stateless environment

78102
stdout	stderr
it can capture stderr and stdout

78104
children	parent
a quad tree is a 2 dimensional tree in which at each level a node has 4 children each of which covers 1 4 of the area of the parent node

78104
children	parent
an oct tree is a 3 dimensional tree in which at each level a node has 8 children each of which contains 1 8th of the volume of the parent node

78104
intersect	contains
intersection algorithms work by starting at the top of the tree and recursively traversing into any child nodes that intersect the object being tested at some point you get to leaf nodes which contains the actual objects

78121
quicksort	mergesort
probably your best bet would be quicksort or mergesort

78125
g++	gcc
the following code snippet correctly gives a warning in c and an error in c++ using gcc g++ respectively tested with versions 3.4.5 and 4.2.1

78128
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you can increase type safety too like an automated typesafe malloc realloc free

78151
firefox	safari
further webmail as fail-over squirrelmail on mail server in firefox camino safari

78171
post	get
if it is get or post better return error code as the calling httpwebrequest .net or other code will receive server error and have to deal with it to extract the exception code

78217
postgresql	mysql
use ldap ad for authentication only tie ldap users to a most robust profile authorization server using some sort of traditional database mssql postgresql mysql or document based db couchdb simpledb et cetera

78231
filesystems	fat
if you re sure that for larger writes you can get sufficient throughput and i m not sure that s the case but the filesystems might be doing something stupid like updating the fat after every write then having an encoding thread piping data to a writing thread with sufficient buffering in the writing thread to avoid stalls

78238
put	get
i can put together a very nice looking app the prototypes look slick - but when i need to interact with the user to ask questions get input i have to use wx

78294
udp	tcp
traditionally this means that you want to craft all of the layer 4 header tcp udp icmp.

78340
postgresql	mysql
use ldap ad for authentication only tie ldap users to a most robust profile authorization server using some sort of traditional database mssql postgresql mysql or document based db couchdb simpledb et cetera

78368
free	malloc
if you use malloc free instead of new delete malloc and free won t care about the type

78368
free	malloc
so if you re using a c-like pod plain old data like a build-in type or a struct you can malloc some type and free another

78383
atomic	compare-and-swap
use the latter for any atomic operations on pointers so you re 32 64-bit compatible automatically. that goes whether you want to do things like atomic compare-and-swap increment decrement spin locking or stack queue management

78446
matplotlib	chaco
the main advantages of chaco are its speed relative to matplotlib and its integration with enthought s traits api for interactive applications

78487
atoi	atof
atoi and atof will convert or return a 0 if it can t

78514
folder	directory
1 that php may store your sessions in a tmp folder or other directory that may be accessible to other users on your server

78546
temp	tmp
you can use tmp myscript.scratch. as your temp file for things that need not be extremely reliable or secure

78565
atoi	atof
don t use atoi and atof as these functions return 0 on failure

78569
atoi	atof
atoi and atof will convert the number even if there are trailing non numerical characters

78569
strtol	strtod
however if you use strtol and strtod it will not only skip leading white space and an optional sign but leave you with a pointer to the first character not in the number

78580
atoi	atof
using sscanf you can be certain if the string is a float or int or whatever without having to special case 0 as is the case with atoi and atof solution

78585
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve been playing with scriptaculous and jquery

78591
asterisk	pbx
asterisk is the open-source pbx that you can use to

78627
strtol	atoi
use strtol strtoll not atoi to check integers

78627
atof	strtod
use strtof strtod not atof to check doubles

78627
atoi	atof
atoi and atof convert the initial part of the string but don t tell you whether or not they used all of the string

78627
strtol	strtod
strtol strtod tell you whether there was extra junk after the characters converted

78641
openmesh	cgal
i ve tried both cgal and openmesh but both fail miserably in the last point

78646
put	get
normally i say put as little in pl sql as possible - it is typically a lot less maintainable - at one of my last jobs i really saw how messy and hard to work with it could get

78655
floating-point	integer
it pops the value off the floating-point stack converts it to an integer and then stores at at the address specified

78688
hash	md5
generate a random something fairly long then tack the score to the end and maybe the name or something else static then sha1 md5 it and pass both to the server verify that the random hash to be equal to the hash

78723
googletest	cppunit
are there any means to do this with cppunit or googletest frameworks

78819
xslt	sgml
the sgml is then combined with xslt and transformed into html

78821
cairngorm	flex
but i suggest using cairngorm for any data intensive flex application

78837
avr	microcontroller
fyi the arduino is basically a board and software library designed around the wonderful avr microcontroller

78892
post	get
this assembly function based off my previous post here but i had to modify the concept a bit to get it to actually work processes 3.3 billion input characters per second 6.6 billion output characters on one core of a core 2 conroe 3ghz

78911
y-combinator	combinators
in response to the y combinators comment i might as well through in the y-combinator in the ski calculus

78918
cpu	processors
while earlier we never even noticed the cpu load now the processors usage was way up

78979
put	get
and once you get started you ll want to put an mcu everywhere

79115
umbraco	dotnetnuke
i tried graffiti and dotnetnuke and thought both were troublesome then i tried umbraco based on a recommendation from a friend and i love it

79118
asterisk	ivr
i have successfully tried asterisk with lumenvox for a speech recognition ivr

79118
voip	sip
it also supports a wide range of voip protocols sip h323 iax .

79118
asterisk	pbx
asterisk is an open source software pbx that runs primarily on linux

79134
width	height
simply set the width and height values to auto where you instantiate your control and this will override the design-time values for that usercontrol

79134
width	height
another option is to set a combination of minwidth and minheight to a size that allows design-time work while width and height remain auto

79163
int	chars
is of type long the macros will work just as well on chars s short s int s

79182
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
as others have noted worst case of quicksort is o n 2 while mergesort and heapsort stay at o nlogn

79219
perforce	cvs
if converting from vss to perforce is a real pain you can convert vss to cvs and then to perforce

79236
vim	emacs
the only other editor with a superset of vim s features is emacs

79281
super	extends
generics can also have their bounds defined with the keywords super and extends

79358
vim	emacs
its true that vim and emacs are very powerful tools but the learning curve is very steep

79358
kde	gnome
i use gnome and i m yet to see a kde app that looks good in gnome sorry i m sure its a great program

79358
geany	kdevelop
my advice is to investigate kdevelop geany and code blocks as a starting point

79446
ssl	https
to clarify earlier answers the http protocol is registered with port 80 and http over ssl aka https is registered with port 443

79449
width	height
you should use width height

79459
width	height
aspect should be a function of your window width and height

79459
width	height
specifically width divided by height but watch out for division by zero

79474
put	get
i can put them in one of the shell rc files that get sourced and this solves the environment variables for processes spawned from the console

79490
uptime	reboot
after a reboot i dont see an option for the uptime command to print a history of uptimes

79495
perforce	cvs
there is a simlar page for cvs to perforce conversion here although i don t have direct experience with that

79496
gmail	hotmail
i have seen several other sites do this and also connect to yahoo gmail and hotmail contacts

79515
uptime	reboot
you could take the difference between each successive reboot and that should give the uptime of the machine

79550
width	height
if you can get that to work you might want to try progressively removing the height width position attributes from div.header to get the minimal required attributes to get the effect you want

79577
bazaar	git
sun did an evaluation of a href rel noreferrer git a a href rel noreferrer mercurial a and a href rel noreferrer bazaar a as candidates to replace the sun teamware vcs for the solaris code base

79620
solaris	aix
this is the case in windows linux solaris aix etc.

79658
kde	gnome
linux gnome or kde

79677
floating-point	fixed-point
i need to speed up a program for the nintendo ds which doesn t have an fpu so i need to change floating-point math which is emulated and slow to fixed-point

79677
typedef	struct
should i make a fixedpoint class or just a fixedpoint8 typedef or struct with some functions macros to convert them or something else

79688
min	median	min	max	percentile	max	median	percentile	median	max
i d like to be able to select the 25th median and 75th percentile for a single column of scores preferably in a single record so i can combine with average max and min

79695
installation	upgrade
when appropriate quality control teams should be able to conduct security regression usability performance stress installation upgrade testing and not developers

79699
uptime	reboot
whenever the uptime reduces there s been a reboot since the previous record

79709
terminate	timeout
ideally i d like to be able to terminate the function or have it fail due to network timeout without losing all the information processed prior to termination

79727
vxworks	rtos
in the vxworks rtos there is a shell that allows you to issue command to your embedded system

79771
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are then a very simple integer operation such as 0.72 + 1 becomes 72 + 100 becomes 172 becomes 1.72

79771
multiplying	multiplication
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

79771
cos	sin
example since you re using fixed-2 representation there s only 100 values in the range 0.0 1 0-99 and sin cos repeat outside this range so you only need a 100-integer lookup table

79787
stdout	stderr
i ve investigated this and it appears that i need to access console stdout and stderr buffers

79845
checkstyle	cpd
for static analysis tools i often use cpd pmd findbugs and checkstyle

79867
expression-blend	silverlight
as brian stated you can just use expression-blend and create any wpf silverlight apps

79890
onmousedown	onmouseup
just put the below toggleon in the onmousedown and toggleoff in the onmouseup of the button

79901
strace	systemtap
some applications can trick strace ptrace not to run so the only real option i ve had is using systemtap

79948
checkstyle	cpd
i use maven2 for builds and with it you can configure a series of reporting plugins including pmd cpd checkstyle coberturba etc
