it is perfectly fine to add calayer sublayers to the layer that backs a uiview although that layer will not have all the added functionality that uiview brings to the party

17762292

it s probably best to think of a uiview as a calayer with a bunch of extra functionality added to it

if you are trying to host the blogengine site within a virtual directory of the umbraco site then you will have to amend the blogengine web.config to remove all the umbraco-specific handlers and modules as these will be inherited by the blogengine application causing this exception because the application can t find the relevant dlls in its bin folder

lets say that on mouseenter of the img you set opcaity to a value then do the same on mouseenter of the div when mouseenter of the div change the opcity of the image then also duplicate the code of mouseleave so that opcaity gets set back if the user leaves either the div or the image

17764688

the second effect will be that the subclassing in java inherited all the base fields of the superclass they are not initialized pesodao reference of the proxy instance will be null

17765220
inherited	subclassing
another minor restriction is that in subclassing the framework will need to have a strategy to decide which inherited constructor to call - in spring cglib the parameterless constructor is preferred so you will be forced to create one if the compiler did not do this automatically

17773269
googletest	gmock
recently i tried to link gmock with googletest inside to my project

17773294
superclass	subclassing
based on the title i could interpret this as i want the _initiallist attribute of some instance of the superclass to be available for instances of a couple of subclassing so they can all act upon the same exact list

17773294
superclass	subclassing
you could do that if _initiallist is a class attribute or you could pass an instance of the superclass as an __init__ argument when instantiating the subclassing as far as i know currently

17773294
superclass	subclassing
where as if you keep it as an instance attribute and pass an instance of the superclass to the subclassing as an argument as a shared object then you can still achieve what you want to do and still have the flexibility to create multiple instances of your shared object

17773305
strtol	strcmp
you can strcmp the individual tokens to check whether you have a write or a register or whatever and then turn the last one into a number with strtol

17773319

since you seam to want to be using i would recommend adding a new line to your etc sudoers use visudo for that

17773377
sudo	passwd
sudo will not ask for the passwd for some_user and the script will run as expected

17773377

17773512
int	double
neither int nor double or any other objects extending number class have + or any other operator definied

17773512
int	double
the only reason why you are able to perform something like int + double is autoboxing

17773512
int	double
and autoboxing is a kind of hardcoded feature which applies to a very small predefined set of classes such as int double etc

17773540
width	height
the element s display is inline-block since i want its width height to be calculated depending on its content

17773564

but if i edit one product and put it again into the cart - the addional options get lost they are no longer in the database.

17773591
allegro	sdl
i m not new to c++ as i ve used allegro sdl before

17773593

i am doing this so that passing keyup keydown will add keyup and keydown listeners which is better than calling each prototype function individually

17773614
put	get
and then for your navigation bar after you get passed the first layer put that on position fixed

17773667

i m only testing in safari and firefox at the moment

17774165
put	get
that said get should probably accept movie_title arg as it is put in you urlpatterns so that you can deduce an appropriate movie object from it

17774185
width	height
obiviously changing the height and width properties do not affect this either

17774188
firefox	safari
i have a bit of css3 animation in my website and it works fine on safari but when i run the site in firefox it doesn t animate

17774193
width	height
they take up slightly less height space than the rows mentioned above but the random button was double the width to fill up the space

17774286
cpu	processors
unfortunately rdtsc on new processors doesn t actually count cpu clock cycles

17774292
post	get
i ve followed this post for reference but i can t get it to work

17774325
int	chars
it seems on your machine int are aligned at 4 bytes and so the compiler pads the struct with an extra 3 bytes after the chars

17774337
for-loop	loops
a python for-loop is what s generally known as a for each loops in programming

17774337
for-loop	loops
unlike other for-loop constructs however foreach loops usually maintain no explicit counter they essentially say do this to everything in this set rather than do this x times

17774337
for-loop	loops
unlike many other kinds of loops such as the while loops the for-loop is often distinguished by an explicit loops counter

17774337
for-loop	loops
so the range or xrange builtins can be used in a python for-loop to mimic the effect of a loops counter

17774338

you have to find a style for progressring and set yourself the width and height

17774344
width	height
by default there are width and height of 60

17774344
width	height
as far as i understand easy set width and height directly affects only the ellipses

17774344
width	height
forging these operations with these parameters you can configure the width and height of progressring control

17774374
put	get
if you put it inside loop it ll get the last id s value is 39 when it fisnishes

17774378
int	chars
you have an int followed by a chars or a bool followed by

width	font-size
so for example font-size 5vh would set font size to 5 of the body width

17775395
width	height
the font size is the height of the font and does not have any defined relationship with the widths of letters which vary so there is really no way in css to make some text occupy 80 of some width

17775405
hide	show
a simple solution i already have is to hide the mainwindow.cs and latter on closing the second window make a new object of first window and show it.but it is not a good way i think because there is already a object created by .net framework for first window automatically so why we should create a new object of mainwindow.cs

free	malloc
heap dynamically allocated memory malloc free referred by a pointer

17775923
for-loop	arrays
if you access an arrays with an index variable it essentially always decays to a pointer since the index may change for example increment in a for-loop

17775923
int	double
also note that here the generated code will contain a double indirection first the code loads a pointer by i from arr then it will load an int from that pointer by j

17775964
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
in the previous code i assumed you have a vector3 struct with add subtract multiplying crossproduct and dotproduct operations

17776000

17776276
width	height
i want .container s height to be set dynamically to s width and its height to s width and it should change when the window is resized

17776276
width	height
the container currently has 100 height width but once it s rotated via css it retains its inherited dimensions and does not stretch to browser window size which i suppose is only logical

17776276
width	height
i don t know much of javascript other than to change values in jquery plugins but i assume it s possible using js to dynamically alter .container s height and width to s computed width and height respectively

17776282
width	height
100 in width and height in relation to browser window size

17776289
strncpy	strtok
like strtok or strncpy they are simply not safe to work with

17776784
post	get
about it is a jquery method that allows you to get data from the server using post method instead of the usual get method but that would be some parameters the script that interacts with the database needs

17776794

raphael image elements created with paper.image don t have this problem in svg mode but have a very similar problem that is really bad in ie8 vml mode

well if you correctly position your hover activated div as absolute in relation to it s parent you can simply set it s width and height at 100 and it s always going to have the good size

17791946
getter	setter
on the other hand in approach b you have generated mappers after compilation and that is pure getter and setter based mapping

hide	show
so i want firstly hide the slide then do all other things and finally - show the slide

17792568
post	get
the type of request to make post or get default is get

17792599

17792626
rss	feed
many apps that do this type of thing do so through html scraping or xml parsing rss feed

17792626

17792843
express	node.js
below is a fairly standard node.js express structure

17792854
draggable	droppable
if there is a small number of containers - you might declare droppable separately and use accept to allow only certain classes of draggable like in the demo below

17792854
draggable	droppable
trying to hack draggable droppable is possible but not very easy especially with complex elements if draggable and droppable have more complex html structure than just flat divs

17792857
google-chrome	safari
works in safari but not google-chrome

17792859

17793186
folder	directory
can someone help-me to hide the sub directory folder of this sub domain for all pages of my sub domain folder in c# using code or web config

17793195
getter	setter
reading your question again the getter and setter for profile won t help because what

17793195
getter	setter
is going into the action is just primitive fields email etc. so you should have getter setter for these fields instead and then to re-populate the fields into the jsp

17793204
post	get
what i do is that i do a javascript ajax post and then i take the content that i get back and place it into a new window

17793226
equals	gethashcode
the second approach is not going to work because arrays do not override the gethashcode and equals in a way that would use the data stored in the array

17793233
put	get
i am trying to get a bunch of data from two json urls and put them into a table

17793239

so i want to put those two queries in one and get the different out of it

17793298

everywhere else i saw it being done in onresume and onpause

17793343
width	height
according to the css box model spec the default behavior to an element which has padding applied is to increase its width and height

17793343
width	height
however you can change this behavior by setting the box-sizing css3 rule that makes your element to not sum up the padding to the final width height

17793343
width	height
there is a workaround if you don t want to subtract your column s width height from the padding width you can create a wrapper div inside it and apply the padding to it or attach the padding to the inner elements not the parent div itself

17793459
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i wanted to create a view like the native twitter facebook sharing sheet s size with uinavigationcontroller so that i can push pop more uiviewcontroller

17793463
punctuation	words
the universal index does index punctuation but only for node values not for words

17793463
punctuation	words
the term lists for words query do not include punctuation because the tokenizer defines words as strings that do not contain whitespace or punctuation

17793463
punctuation	words
however for most languages that feature still does not allow words to include punctuation

17793518
range	minimum
try subtracting the minimum first then scale to your data range

17793551
firefox	safari
the only problem is that in safari and firefox the padding renders differently and the nav items are visible outside of the header

17793551
width	height
i thought doing this method with widths and height would fix it but i can t change the width and or height of the lis

17793578

i use only the default for onpause onresume ect.

17793585
put	get
is there anyway to detect that to get rid of the spinning loader that you put

17793598
subclass	abstract-class
however i am only ever going to subclass this in c++ this would be an abstract-class so i want this method to also return the members in its child class

17793599
google-chrome	firefox
further testing through firefox showed that this is not specific to google-chrome

17793612
post	get
they can be modeled using post and get respectively on the processing resource

17793620
google-chrome	firefox
ie10 behaves the same way as google-chrome so i think it s a firefox problem

17793629
rpm	yum
when i jumped ahead and attempted to install the rpm pyqt4-webkit it said it was already installed probably due to my yum commands below

getter	setter
you need to provide the getter and setter of field error to access it from value stack

17793703
width	height
in line 42 try replacing the line height 1px with width 1px

17793772
ng-init	ngmodel
there are lots of ways to redesign your code to deal with this but the simple and probably not best way would be to use something like ng-init to get the result of the function call and then insert that result into the ngmodel

17793775
decoder	encoder
to that end i ve tried my hand at implementing the encoder decoder from the 802.11a specification

17793775
decoder	encoder
that is 380 bits of the decoder output do not match the original input to the encoder

17793784
for-loop	loops
better yet rather than iterating using a counter in a while loops just use a for-loop

17793804
hex	binary
convert the hex string to binary

17793817
jpql	hql

gridview	repeater
just as a disclaimer i normally use repeater controls instead of gridview controls

17793997
put	get
jquery allows you to get the text of a div with the text method example which you can later put in a variable and use in conditionals see

17793997
addclass	removeclass
later on the best way to go i think is by adding some classes with the addclass method and eventually removing some classes with removeclass

17794022
versioning	upgrade
the solution is either to upgrade to a newer axiom versioning or to add woodstox to your application so that it is used instead of weblogic s stax implementation

a note from the docs on keypress keyup keydown

17807387
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed while keypress indicates which character was entered

for example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup but as 97 by keypress

17807387
keydown	keyup
the keypress event works in almost all situations but it s prudent to use keyup or keydown because some browsers i think some older version of firefox don t detect certain keys such as arrow keys using the keypress event

the american standard code for information interchange ascii ëˆã ski ass-kee 1 is a character-encoding scheme originally based on the english alphabet that encodes 128 specified chars - the numbers 0-9 the letters a-z and a-z some basic punctuation symbols some control codes that originated with teletype machines and a blank space - into the 7-bit binary int

17807802
int	chars
so in few word c - 0 convert a digit chars 0 - 9 into an int 0-9

17807860

webkit	gecko
now while webkit chromium25 and opera 12 shrink the parent s calculated rendered width to match the img s new smaller width gecko ff21 leaves it as the img s collective original width and the parent appears to have a big right padding

17808152
webkit	gecko
a solution that makes gecko behave like webkit imo webkit s way is more logical

17808152
webkit	gecko
when i set the parent to display inline-block webkit shows the same behavior as gecko

17808152
children	parent
and while webkit shrinks the parent to neatly wrap its children it only does so upon page load not after a resize.

17808152
webkit	gecko
in my workaround - devoid of position absolute height 100 - i discovered a gecko webkit inconsistency

17808152
box-sizing	border-box
with box-sizing border-box resp

17808152
children	parent	webkit	gecko
-moz-box-sizing webkit shrinks the parent to match the children width blue div smaller than the yellow one while gecko does not blue and yellow div equal width

17808261
inherited	subclassing
i m searching how to do this method with a generic manner to inherited it in the subclassing and just cast that dynamic object to the type of the subclass.the only generic way that i have found is to create a dummy class with attributes created from the json data keys afterwards cast this nsobject to the model subclassing class

getter	setter
the sad truth is that scala does not allow you to override the getter nor the setter of a var

17808450
getter	setter
a somewhat ugly work around is to define a getter and setter yourself like this

17808450
getter	setter
simpleitem is still functionally equivalent to your orignal version and you can now override the setter and getter now your bundle class will compile fine as is

my local timezone is utc -5 so if i put in an end_time of 09 00 00 i would expect that to get saved to the database as 14 00 00 but it s getting saved as 09 00 00 so when i later run my query i m getting the wrong results i m off by those 5 hours

17813199
put	get
i put it back in the server using filezilla but now i get this error when i view the page

you also need to add a background rectangle with the width and height of your stage so that the layer can detect your clicks

17813332
google-chrome	safari
so i have tested in windows safari and google-chrome

17813336
int	chars
the aim of the code is to pass to a function a filename an int which will be set as the number of lines in the file and an array of chars one for each line and within the function the file will be opened and each line passed into the array

17813412
put	get
and then at the end of the day when you put all this together you get this

17813431
free	malloc
also note that you have to reserve space using malloc for each string you want to store in the array and free at the very end a simplified example

17813449
hide	show
the javascript functions to initialize show hide the dialogs is exactly as show above

17813456
for-loop	loops
2- if you will always have 502 to 607 then you can loops through them using a for-loop

17813495
sorting	grouping
i ve selected the series grouping properties set the grouping expression to grouping on contactname and then changed the sorting expression to avg fields

17813513
mouseleave	mousedown	mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mousedown
for the markers though you will need mousedown mousemove mouseleave events since you got 2 of them

17813524
ganglia	metrics
however i wonder if this is the best way of doing this if you want to observe specific behaviour you might be better off isolating a specific input file and debugging against a local pseudo-cluster and if you want system metrics you could do worse than give ganglia a lookm as it is pretty mauch already built into hadoop

17813582
google-chrome	firefox
i m using google-chrome but it probably does this in firefox also

17813583
octal	hex
for â that s #168 0xa8 in hex or 250 in octal

17813642
children	parent
on the parent and display table-cell on the children gives you such a rendering

17813648
ethernet	wireless
if your machine only has one interface the difference is moot but it matters if for example you have both wired and wireless ethernet

17813667
folder	directory
i decided to take parameters to put me straight in folder for certain weeks or the parent directory or the directory with all my reference material

17813699
portrait	landscape
i want to use different layout for landscape and portrait

17813715
stdout	stderr
if the program is outputting to stderr instead of stdout this redirects stderr to stdout

17813737
google-chrome	safari
the code below works fine when not using ie internet explorer i tested it with version 10 but i thinks it s probably most all of them in google-chrome and safari it works fine you can sort it and the search for each row shows up but not in ie even if you click on the refresh href link nothing happens in ie

17813815
folder	directory
2.create a seperate folder in the directory of the main script and put the additional modules there along with an __init__.py script

17813845
floating-point	integer
there are numerous other overloads for for various integer and floating-point numeric types for std string and so forth

17813850
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux

17813857
width	height
in this case you have requested match_parent in the layout height and since an imageview has a default scaletype of fit_center therefore content aspect ratio is maintained so the width will change

17813867
cvs	svn
the best way to really do this is to use source control to keep your projects in sync and i strongly recommend git over cvs or svn

17813919
post	get
when the users post some actions i sometimes get the following error

17813954
plone	buildout
large python projects such as plone and django use buildout see for a good blog post describing it

17814024
folder	dir
i tried to install this package from tar.gz and with . configure --prefix i define the desired destination folder so i have write authority over that dir and after the . configure command i try to build pango with make but i recieve the following errors and warnings

17814034
versioning	upgrade
from what i understand this is used to upgrade locks between the 2.2 and 2.4 versioning of mongodb

17814075
qgraphicsview	qmainwindow
in addition to the answer from jamingrey you can call the qmainwindow function setcentralwidget passing the qgraphicsview object to add it to the qmainwindow

17814075
qgraphicsview	qmainwindow
if you re not using qmainwindow call the qgraphicsview function show

17814075
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
ensure that qgraphicsscene is dynamically allocated before being added to the qgraphicsview as the view takes a pointer to the scene

17814080
updatepanel	ascx
throughout my application i generally use a lot of server user controls both ascx and vb server controls that work with updatepanel

17814093
google-chrome	safari
and it crashes on mac both safari and google-chrome when i start actively using it

17814112
puts	gets
never ever ever set the type of an object or embed tag before you add it to the dom -- doing so causes it to instantiate the plugin and then puts it in a kinda weird state when it gets moved

17814146
google-chrome	safari
trying to use the inkfilepicker and getting some security errors in google-chrome works in safari though

17814195
stdout	stderr
in addition at runtime i test to see if stdout and stderr are tty s

17814215
rvm	bundler
i m using rvm with bundler and i recently installed a new version of the bootstrap-sass gem

17814240
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this behaviour has been tested in google-chrome firefox safari ie

17814263
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox handled reloading jquery more gracefully than ie so it was a more obvious problem but the underlying cause was on all browsers

17814264
post	get
since you are using jre 6 you can t use all the nio file utilities and despite everyone loving apache commons as a quick way to answer forum post you may not like the idea of having to add that utility on just to get one function

17814340
g++	gcc
1 i have python 2.7 and i just installed mingw with options gcc and g++ and some other options

17814353
nsstring	nsdata
i already tried converting the nsdata to an nsstring then storing the string in the array but of course it is interpreted as characters after putting it in the string regardless of the encoding i ve used

17814386
min	max	range	max	range	min
that gives us our min and max now we need a range

17814481
versioning	upgrade
i want to update httpclient versioning in my project.the project was using http 3.1 jar now i need to upgrade 4.0 version.i downloaded repository from here

17814483
width	height
note that you can not currently set a width height you will have to determine the new scale and use the scalex scaley properties

17814500
width	height
what can i do to have a custom height and width that is also automatic

17814500
width	height
meaning if the content in there exceeds my width and height it should be able to become dynamic and change

17814528
burn	uninstaller
that could lead to the user doing something other than uninstaller but there d be no way for burn to know that what it requested wasn t done

17814578
post	get
to configure log4j i followed this post but when i try to deploy i get an exception

17814599
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
so far only google-chrome safari and opera have a neat implementation but all other browsers are buggy

17814632
mouse	keyboard
if the laptop is running windows 7-8 you can install microsoft garage mouse without borders and use your phone as a mouse and keyboard

17814718
vbscript	vba
in order to use it in vba you will need to add a reference to microsoft vbscript regular expressions 5.5 and here s the vba behind this

17814787
macports	homebrew
i just removed macports and all packages were recognized as already installed via homebrew

17814842
keydown	keyup
the lag is i think due to the keyup triggering the dostuff a bit too late but the keydown is a bit too soon

17814864
setinterval	settimeout
chenged setinterval with settimeout and many others

17814884
folder	directory
this will install all your modules inside a new your current directory in a folder called node_modules

17814962
nasm	fasm
it is not my job but better use fasm or at least nasm

17814968
folder	directory
go to the extras folder in your android sdk directory and copy google-play-services_lib folder to somewhere handy for you

17814972
public	protected
in your case it might be useful to make _batchidoption public and parkpaydbcontext protected or private

17815004
setinterval	settimeout
the snippet doesn t use setinterval at all instead it s based on nested settimeout s

17815025
implements	extends
so to implements optimistic concurrency one need just extends every jqgrid table with additional hidden column which hold the rowversion value

17815104
google-chrome	firefox
works only in firefox and google-chrome though

17815144
implements	extends
here you extends off the foundation of which implements so foreach and other iterating methods work from it

17815158
put	get
i get this error both when i use an ajax method against that put url and when i use fiddler2 and force it to be a put request

17815212
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you have to call setcontentview before you can call findviewbyid so your code will be

17815257
public	protected
subclassing qtablewidget public you will have access to that protected slot

17815281
put	get
put the code in the get method..

17815301
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox the property works but only in ie i m having this problem

17815305
portrait	landscape
in portrait there is a player full screen 1fragment in landscape i want it to change to a list at the left and a player at the right 2fragment

17815339
accessor	properties
the equivalent to making sure that the contained object does not strongly reference its container is using for accessing both methods and ivars the better if you access ivars through accessor as when using properties

17815342
int	double
the total - properties are double precision floating point numbers giving you the total timespan in the given unit of time whereas the properties that are just the name of the unit days hours minutes seconds... give you that unit s component of the timespan as an int

17815352
hide	show
to also hide the green tab and show it when the user scrolls down do this jquery

17815368
subclass	abstract-class
a val on an abstract-class or trait may be left un-initialized - though it must be initialized by a concrete subclass somewhere along the line

17815374
pop-up	dialog
just apply a monochromeeffect from the wpf shader effect library whenever you pop-up a dialog

17815453
onkeyup	onkeydown
cursor keys continue to navigate text in the edit control rather than shifting focus and i receive onkeypress and onkeydown and onkeyup events for the tab key

17815457
pull	push
the web service use .net so can easily pull the data from crm and push as well and because is a web service you can consume it by any platform with soap or rest is your decision

17815474
int	chars
the data type precedence allows for implicit conversion from chars types chars varchar nchar nvarchar to number types int float decimal

17815475
subtract	add
when processing new points if we see that a point makes a really bug jump in the x direction - we assume that it s wrapped and we add or subtract the width of the world to move the point back to other points from that country

17815524
int	double
so if you don t require an exact int representation you could use a float or a double otherwise you could look for a arbitrary long number library there are many available either for c or c++

17815549
int	double
the double type can hold some values up to that range but it can t represent all int in that range because as noted in one of the other answers you would need 67 bits to represent all such int while a double has only 52 bits of mantissa

17815554
post	get
i already tryed jsoup with post session cookie and then get but that ends in an force close

17815633
slideup	slidedown
the idea is to have a section that will bounceoutleft have it s container slideup next container slidedown then use bounceinright on the next container s content

17815639
maven	pom.xml
then i noticed that my other maven project popped up with an error with the pom.xml that the first one had as well

17815729
postgresql	mysql
there s no need to abandon mysql and migrate to postgresql

17815759
pull	push
the difference is that a pub socket sends the same message to all subscribers whereas push does a round-robin amongst all its connected pull sockets

17815759
pull	push
the push pull pattern is really a pipelining mechanism

17815759
pull	push
your push pull example seems to be attempting to do load-balancing which is fine but req rep might be better suited to that due to other issues

17815759
pull	push
it looks like the issues here are described in the same part of the 0mq guide you got the image from push pull ventilator example

17815793
prepare	bindparam
notice the prepare method and the bindparam method

17815815
decoder	encoder
blooddy_crypto claims according to it s benchmark to have a faster base64 encoder decoder than the mx.utils one

17815823
maven	pom.xml
to make maven understand any other structure than the above you ll have to override these settings in pom.xml

17815828
required	placeholder
if the problem you are facing is that after entering email the form is sent by the return key then as you are using a html5 property placeholder you can also use required on the password field which won t allow a return action on the email field to send it

17815851
google-chrome	safari
i looked at your site in google-chrome and safari but it doesnâ t seem to be having the issue you mentioned

17815858
installation	upgrade
i want to upgrade an existing git installation onto my vps server

17815889
ostringstream	std
try using only the standard c++ std ostringstream class instead

17815917
xslt	xquery
i think xquery would be more convenient if you had all of your xml in a database but on the filesystem xslt may be simpler

17815943
initializer	class-method
i can initializer simple variables but want to call class-method to do it and i get undefined method

17815956
google-chrome	safari
i have also tried this with both safari and google-chrome

17816033
versioning	upgrade
in addition to what the others already mentioned liferay ee is supported for 5 years after release while you won t get upgrade for major ce versioning once the next release is out - so you need to upgrade less often

17816055
implements	extends
one way to do that is using partial classes that extends the poco entities and that implements the ivalidatableobject interface and return a list of validationresult

17816150
junit	testng
since a while it is possible to configure maven surefire to execute junit tests and testng tests in one build

17816150
junit	testng
i won t expand on the reasons why i m doing that ok hint testng is our standard framework but some frameworks like jnario require junit

17816150
junit	testng
this works quite well junit tests and testng tests get executed

17816150
junit	testng
but - now i see that testng tries to execute the junit tests too and maybe vice-versa - with no success of course because it won t see any of its annotations but it looks like it re-marks the tests to passed .

17816176
getter	setter
getter setter class

17816184
implements	extends
extends would normally work but in this case it does not due to how the url_helpers method is implements

17816185
instances	transient
my understanding is that i have to create a separate new transient instances in the loop body in the transaction

17816185
instances	transient
from my experience not creating a separate transient instances transient instances outside loop body inserts at the very least the one row that being the last row

17816186
integer	fractions
the integer part of the number is the date number of days counted since january 1st 1900 and the decimal portion of the number is the time fractions of day

17816186
subtract	add
this makes it easy to compare two dates you can compare add or subtract dates just as if you were using numbers

17816195
google-chrome	firefox
the following works for me for google-chrome and firefox

17816218
int	double
double can store the range you desire.you can also use big int library.here s an example

17816283
portrait	landscape
i had a friend help me out he used 2 views in one xib file with iboutlets for portrait and landscape view and he toggled between them the device rotated

17816309
jboss	glassfish
it is not something that spring would support but rather your application container tomcat websphere glassfish jboss ...

17816336
getter	setter
this might need to be done to support accessing from multiple threads but some sort of thread synchronization needs to be in the getter and setter in that case

17816348
google-chrome	firefox
since each image width is traced out to be the same in firefox and google-chrome the weirdest part i just set the width of the image to the width that s traced out and that fixed it

17816383
put	get
if they are not there you need to put the jar somewhere on the box and edit setenv.sh to include it unless you can put it in where it will get picked up automatically

17816409
put	get
you can make a web request from your server and get http response from remote server and put them into div element

17816509
public	protected
first it is calling public topdocs search query query filter filter int n on line 271 which is calling protected topdocs search weight weight scoredoc after int ndocs on line 428

17816516
stdout	fflush
you need to have a new line character to see the output or fflush the stdout otherwise sometimes it doesn t print or it will be combined with the next line.

17816535
punctuation	words
yet inspecting the code reveals that we are counting punctuation marks as part of the words ie

17816535
punctuation	words
as two diferent words because of the punctuation mark

17816637
width	height
the new created array use the largest of the two image s width and height as it s own

17816660
int	chars
i need int and chars variables to be declared in a single pool

17816688
dbcontext	objectcontext
i do not know whether it s dbcontext s feature or objectcontext has the same behavior

17816737
sorting	filtering
now i must admit that the sorting is not perfect like i would need to take in account each three of the filtering but that s another story

17816802
folder	directory
once you ve drawn the initial scan for directory contents hierachically you might want to use shfilechangenotify and listen for wm_filechangeinfo messages though i only looked quickly through the win32 sdk and i seem to remember a version that applied specifically to folder and their contents which might be more efficient

17816819
integer	unsigned
type to a dt_i2 data type or an unsigned integer to a signed integer

17816834
folder	directory
i should serve the files folder in the server----config the path tell server the path directory you want to server in the server configuration file i use jboss

17816837
ubuntu	debian
on transferring to a new much faster server from debian squeeze to ubuntu 12.04 i encounter a problem where about 50 of the time the image does not display and instead the server sends a png file of 0 bytes

17816837
chunked	transfer-encoding
i ve tried various workarounds where i send the image size or transfer-encoding chunked as a header via php s header function but did not work and in these cases the browser states the image is corrupted

17816849
memcpy	strncpy
you ll have to create a new character string long enough to contain the two that you want to combine and then manually copy them over with memcpy strncpy or something similar

17816864
post	get
alternatively if you have access to server code you could try making a post using a urlloader to get the proper redirect url from the server thus bypassing the need for javascript

17816874
put	get
put some php file where you want it and get name dirname file

17816954
portrait	landscape
this is a sample adndroid layout for my project it seems great in portrait view but in landscape mode its not showing all the layout component

17816967
rss	feed
i m parsing an rss feed which comes in as an xml and loading it into a uiwebview - and that works perfectly well

17817031
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
to get that margin you can canvas the image in width and height by +50px for both directions see photo 2

17817063
mp3	ogg
for example this is a good place for media such as mp3 or ogg files

17817148
hide	show
you can t just show hide elements

17817167
terminate	timeout
when this happens i can t communicate with it through tools like jvisualvm the tool will say connection timeout and it will also not print a thread dump or terminate when i issue a sigquit kill -3

17817234
flac	ogg
note that for ogg output the default encoder is flac so you may want to add -codec a libvorbis as an output option

17817241
width	margin
then content div with relative width the whole width - except the menu div where will be an container always at center of content div margin auto

17817242
implements	extends
since van and truck have extra feature which car do not have and we cant add that feature in the common interface i think of segregating the interface which is one of the solid principle wherein van and truck would implements another interface which extends the basic interface

17817243
int	chars
the optional width is a non-negative decimal int indicating the minimum number of chars to be written to the output

17817294
terminate	timeout
timeout 1 hour the task is finished in 40 mins hence everything should terminate normally

17817315
pop-up	dialog
2 dialog pop-up asking for additional revert options - revisions etc

17817342
devise	cancan
see my answer here about devise cancan redirect admin

17817410
int	chars
if personid is an int you can also use intval to get the int value of a string and stop invalid chars being passed that way

17817443
division	modulo
if the modulo of the division is zero return false

17817444
google-chrome	firefox
first have a look here with google-chrome and then firefox

17817444
opera	google-chrome
if i try to iterate over the json-object with google-chrome or opera next webkit the

17817444
firefox	safari
firefox or safari desktop or ios runs correctly right order

17817448
maven	pom.xml
sometimes maven integrations in ides like eclipse or intellij do not pick up folders for non-java projects even though the correct maven plugins are in the pom.xml say for building a groovy project

17817495
put	get
to get around this you can simply put the remove in the callback of fadeout

17817521
setinterval	settimeout
i think the biggest problem was the use of settimeout instead of setinterval

17817537
sorting	filtering
check out the documentation for jquery.ajax - in the url you pass to the server you could set the filtering pagination and sorting and in the success handler you would update the values in your table

17817539
csv	tsv
maybe mallet is generated csv comma separated value or tsv tab separated value files

17817539
apache-poi	opencsv
you could try a library like opencsv to read the file create an xls file from the data using apache-poi

17817560
client-side	server-side
you can not mix scala variables server-side with js variables client-side as they are generated in quite distant environments

17817570
viewdidload	viewwillappear
iâ ve tried setting the colour on several occasions in the application viewwillappear and viewdidload but the problem still occurs

17817577
int	chars	int	double
the type specified in a constant declaration must be sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars float double decimal bool string an enum-type or a reference-type

17817594
cout	cin
in most other usual interactive i o scenarios std endl is redundant when used with std cout because any input from std cin output to std cerr or program termination forces a call to std cout.flush

17817598
nvd3.js	sparklines
i m trying to use nvd3.js with d3.js to make a simple sparklines

17817662
fast-forward	merge
i like that the merge becomes a fast-forward so i know that what i just merge is exactly the same as what i just tested in my branch

17817667
hide	show
on hover over the whole div hide the background image and show the components

17817677
screens	mdpi
i d advise you to start with devices considered normal screens normal and mdpi density because that is the baseline

17817687
width	height
make sure your div actually has a set height width if it is empty

17817758
folder	directory
also the project directory now contains a folder named android containing the manifest file and some other files

17817762
copying	overwrite
since in the following copying part you want to overwrite the original terminating null of dest the first version works better

17817771
width	height
this is absolutely not a must but i found that its easier when giving selectors all their css properties that you group things such as width and height start with width first as that is how you find it in most softwares and font colors sizes boldness and all that good stuff in groups

17817771
width	height
this is so you don t have height declared at the top and width way down at the bottom of the list.

17817805
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a segmentcontrol in a uiviewcontroller which is embedded in uinavigationcontroller

17817805
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m adding another uiviewcontroller as a subview in one of the segment which is also a uinavigationcontroller and pushing another detailviewcontroller from it

17817828
opensolaris	bsd
note that the code must be portable and work for windows and linux and bsd opensolaris etc.

17817829
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am using a uinavigationcontroller and setting the toolbar items by using the method settoolbaritems of my topmost uiviewcontroller

17817849
filtering	grouping
first i tried to filtering lines from data2 in the second .data but i don t know how to access attributes of the actual grouping to filtering all circles except those with the same name value

17817882
d3.js	raphael
raphael can be made to work with the visualisation library d3.js - which outputs svg and is incompatible with ie8 - via the bridging library d34raphael a fork of d3.js adapted for use with raphael

17817882
d3.js	raphael
d34raphael adapts some but not all d3.js features to output into raphael s abstracted objects instead of the dom so that on ie8 raphael can interpret d3.js s output as vml

17817882
svg	vml
fabric can output canvas on ie8 using excanvas to convert to vml and can convert svg to interactive canvas elements

17817882
d3.js	raphael
so it seems theoretically possible that fabric could replace raphael in bridging d3.js and ie8

raphael	excanvas
both raphael and fabric use vml in ie8 but through different engines so there may be differences in what features raphael and fabric s excanvas have managed to implement in vml

17817882
d3.js	raphael
it appears that fabric s groups are more like the native svg groups worked with by d3.js than raphael s sets but i may have overlooked something here

17817905

17817919
background-color	transparency	background-image	background-color
this is indeed confusing but it is specified in the css 2.1 specification clause 14.2 background if the computed value of background-color is transparency and the computed value of background-image is none for the html element as things are by default browsers must instead use the computed value of the background properties for the body element and must not render a background for body make it transparency

17817932

17818055
outputstream	inputstream
it s a universally useful standard code to copy inputstream to outputstream and found in several libraries as well

17818082
content-length	content-type
this does save a few bytes since the server needn t send content-type or content-length headers and a response body

17818127
fflush	gets
even though the sortedhand array stores values succesfully as i ve seen through console.log the switch statement always returns the default case and everyone gets an straight fflush

17818129
decltype	auto
you ll need to look at it anyway for typing whatever you d manually replace auto with and auto serves the great benefit that it lets you declare types that it s impossible to otherwise declare like lambda returns unless doing complex things like decltype which has the same flaw you don t like about auto

17818172
hide	show
and i want to hide this div when either residential or apartment or clicked and show it when revision is clicked

17818228

instead of loading all contents of the specified url i need to format and display only the description of the rss feed

17818270
charindex	substr
assuming you are using sql server you can use a combination of substr and charindex to achieve this

17818346
width	height
last but not least you do have to set a width and a height to your element if it s empty as in with no other markup because otherwise you would only be able to see 20 pixels in width because of your padding left and right

17818439
superclass	subclassing
in general to be elegant i think the superclass and interfaces should have enough methods to handle the needs of all their subclassing implementations

17818441
post	get
i know there are other post similar to this but i cannot seem to get this to work

17818493

as i found earlier charset utf-8 is not specified anywhere in the post request unless you include an empty _charset_ field in the form which in this case will automatically get populated with utf-8

17818612
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven you need to add this dependencies to your pom.xml

17818612

as you see in this example taken from deltaspike documentation you can inject your value in string but also in int long float boolean fields

17818619
post	get
however when i attempt to upload a photo or even a link the item does get posted to the feed but it s to the recent post by others section and not the page feed itself

button	checkbox
i have an ext js 4.2 grid that has 2 columns that use the renderer to place checkbox in 1 column and radio button in another

17818675
fast-forward	merge
yes he should have done a git pull --rebase for a branch not yet pushed before pushing his changes at which point you would have been able to merge his branch as a simple fast-forward merge

17818751
jobs	cron
i have an aws server that runs daily cron jobs reporting on our user base

17818799
ubuntu	debian
imho figuring out the magic tput symbols see man 5 terminfo on a debian ubuntu system is not as easy as looking up the xterm control sequences google the last three words but ymmv

17818920
spaces	delimiter
any field may be blank no spaces no hidden character between the delimiter

17818976
width	height
i originally had the image set as the background for a div of fixed height in which case it was relatively easy to center it but because background images aren t structural i couldn t set the height to be an automatic function of the width and i had to toss this option out when i went for a more responsive design

17818976
width	height
the image width is set to 100 of the width of its container and the height varies accordingly

17818976
width	height	post	get
i ve looked among other things at this post which is definitely close -- but in both solutions the image height is incapable of resizing and in the former the js loads at page load but then freezes so that if i change page width height things get out of whack

17818988
post	get
you can use the javascript to grab the image inside the other form before the ajax post get call that your posttostatus function makes

17819021
hide	show
the solution is to do a mousemove on the green and temporarily hide it in order to read if there is any element at the current mouse position then immediately show it back again

17819029
switching	screens
this means the next time you display the screens the value will result in a screens switching and it will flip back and forth forever and cause a lot of lag

17819031
maven	pom.xml
all of them have there pom.xml layering maven structure and i want to create the conditional steps like at run time i would be able to decide for which types the build is included in the tar i know that it can be done using conditional steps plugin but want to know the better approach if any in ur mind please share.........................

client-side	server-side
often during debug of server-side vb.net c# code that is executed inside of asp.net partial postack updatepanel other controls with ajax behaviors i am getting this client-side error

17819113
google-chrome	safari
and for some reason every time it updated itself it was causing ie safari and google-chrome to receive a mousemove event

17819138
puts	gets
i thought that the whole purpose of using gets puts was that it would read output all of the characters in a string until it encounters a newline character

17819169
post	get
the following is a continuation of this answer that describes create get and post actions for a model with many-to-many relationship between entities subscription and company

although they are implemented over tcp they act like multicast udp allowing for all machines to see all data if you desire

17819266
mp3	ogg
you must use mp3 or if you have google s ogg codec installed ogg

17819274
jobs	cron
because this loop can run forever you should definitely wrap it in a try except block to catch keyboard interrupts and other errors. cron jobs are a perfectly good option if you re only going to be on nix platforms of course but this provides platform independence

17819325
width	height
i am learning monogame these days and there is a class called texture2d that has two readonly members width and height

17819344
mouseup	mousedown
hence i also tried to simulate that using mousedown mouseup but that did not work either

17819378

post	get
i ve tried to use both get and post but nothing alerts or logs to my console like it supposed to not even the error

17819432
for-loop	arrays
the first one is rather cumbersome as it requires duplicating the entire contents of the arrays with a for-loop

17819439
client-side	server-side
you need to understand the difference between server-side languages php and client-side js

17819461
pseudo-class	visited
although i can apply the pseudo-class hover to any element as far as i can tell through my research i can only apply visited to elements

apache	nginx
by the way i use an apache webserver on the api site i saw here nginx could have a problem with the chunked mode

17819499
getter	setter
an autorelease is effectively a deferred release so it s not appropriate for either the getter or the setter to do so

17819499
getter	setter
you should not write your own setter and getter unless there s some compelling need to do so

17819510
put	get
i have simple code that get some parameters via web service and put it in my database her is sql server

17819512

operations like creating a new table or adding new columns should have only minimal impact on the performance and be transparent especially if the application applies the recommended pattern of dealing with transient faults for instances by leveraging the enterprise library

17819562
post	get
converted a post request to a get request with long query

17819607
getter	setter
the more dimension you have the more you have interest in using one single flat array and a getter setter function for your array

17819632
post	get
the solution i came up with to overcome this same problem was to use the pagebeforechange event to look at the request being made and change any get requests to a post request using the built in changepage method

17819655
postgresql	mysql
i m coming from a postgresql background and trying to convert my application to mysql

17819655
postgresql	mysql
i have a query which is very fast on postgresql and very slow on mysql

17819655
postgresql	mysql
the following pseudo query takes 170 ms on postgresql and 5.5 seconds on mysql

17819655
postgresql	mysql
on both mysql and postgresql the speed is the same for the following query less than 10 ms

17819655
postgresql	mysql
again this query takes 14 seconds on mysql and 238 ms on postgresql

17819658
width	height
self._rooms is a table that contains the original x and y position of the room in the grid along with it s width and height endx endy

17819665
width	height
you can use css background-size to set the width to 100 and the height will be calculated to maintain aspect ratio

17819694
width	margin
also the listview does nt fill the width of the screen and leaves a margin on the sides and above

17819712
doc	rtf
i would like to export the contents of a richtextbox with inlineuicontainer inside to pdf format or rtf or doc

17819757
postgresql	mysql
in the nested query mysql is doing the whole join before applying the limit while postgresql is smart enough to figure out that it is only necessary to join any 10 tuples

17819764
gif	png
following the approach mentioned here i can successfully serve up png gif or whatever images i want but since i don t have any control over the of the page that i know of ie9 and presumably others decide that the document mode is quirks as the default

switching	screens
to clarify i want to be able to toggle between the two screens but i am only able to switching from screens 1 to 2

17819864
for-loop	loops
the for-loop s expression doesn t evaluate to true and therefore you never add a single object to loops which is why iterate would print -1 if you added the print statement there

17819889
rss	feed
hey i would like to cut off a title from an rss feed after a specific character in this case the character

17819975
implements	extends
i use this method a lot if my page object implements the loadablecomponent interface by extends loadablecomponent

17819975
implements	extends
note of course by extends loadablecomponent you cannot extends another class by your page object but if you use static methods in a implements interface a jdk8 feature then you can get functionality similar to extends multiple classes or like traits mixins .

17819977
int	double
i would think that this code would work when passed a numeric type double decimal int etc

17819992
pop-up	dialog
when certain actions are taken we need to collect some information from the user so we pop-up a form you could probably call it a dialog

17820018
for-loop	arrays
i can store and later access the data stored in this arrays using a nested for-loop but i get an access violation when trying to free it using the same nested for-loop setup

17820021
min	max
create the master times between min and max

17820084
for-loop	arrays
also in this code below it seems to me that it is treating the variable text as an arrays while the for-loop searches through it

17820117
os.walk	enumerate
i m using os.walk to enumerate a directory tree and i want to skip enumeration on packages such as application bundles

17820243

hide	show
set up custom hide and show methods for your view

17820362
int	double
so let s look specifically at your example i m assuming that you actually have the int before the double in the first case

17820362
int	double
i m also guessing the size and alignment of int and double actually the values i assume are pretty common choice and explain the values you get

17820362
int	double
now int has size and alignment 4 and double has size and alignment 8

17820362
int	double
since directly after the int we are at relative address 4 we are not correctly aligned for the double so we have to add 4 padding bytes which i ll mark with to get to a multiple of 8

17820398
width	height
you can take the average of the width and the height of the cv rotatedrect returned by cv fitellipse to get an approximation of the diameter of the circle you wrote the radius but i think it was a trivial error

17820438
ganglia	metrics
hadoop 2.0 has a metrics context specifically for ganglia 3.1

screens	tablet
this is a much better alternative to having large activity s that do many things which become bloated and hard to maintain and well as difficult to make work with varying screens sizes and orientations think landscape tablet

17820806
post	put
from what i understand a lot of restful apis ignore any kind of request body with a delete request or treat it as a put or post

17820813
width	height
your image tags will have to use the width and height attributes for this to work

17820850
int	boolean
you can then keep a boolean variable to track whether or not the page change was user initiated or not and check it in your onpageselected int position method

17820877
entity-relationship	diagram
though as far as i know with sql server 2012 you can generate the entity-relationship diagram by taking a few simple steps listed below

17820888

17820984
mouse	keyboard
so i m writing a qtwidget that requires keyboard and mouse input by overriding the respective functions

17820987

17821090
fadein	fadeout
they make a nice little fadeout fadein transition when the next and previous buttons are selected

17821090
puts	gets
the second connection gets all the names of the photos and puts them in the form of submits as well

17821141
for-loop	arrays
my idea is to store each value in two dimensional arrays and run for-loop to check if values as equal but i think that solution is not efficient

17821291
post	get
if i get the unique customer name field then i can just use jquery ajax post to pass these two fields to my controller

17821294
fasta	biopython
i m fairly certain that when you use biopython to parse the fasta file it organizes the information into a dictionary of dictionaries

17821311
put	get
if you re doing it server-side then i d put it in the service that you re probably already using to get the data

17821375

see rt-20906 support setting min pref max sizes via css

17821381
hide	show
hide both links in the logged in div using and then show them on the window.onload event using

17821652
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
define a subclassing which inherited from superclass and implements a get function for a

17821666
submit	submission
if you look at the html for that login form you would see that as well as several hidden form fields that you need to submit but are not currently submission

17821666
ssl	https
also because the actual login url is using https you need to attach an ssl iohandler to tidhttp such as tidssliohandlersocketopenssl

17821695
pop-up	dialog
for instance their story-picker dialog pop-up as soon as you edit code not when you re ready to check in

so i upgrade to the latest versioning 6 ooyala module and made the changes to our local code

17821711
width	height
i haven t tested this myself on an sgs4 because i do not own one but if you want to be specific on the initial-scale of the device can try adding after user-scalable where 480px is the viewport width of the sgs4 and the 800px is the viewport height of a sgs4

17821716
gif	png
use a png gif with a transparencies that would do the trick also ensure that the container you are placing it on has no background color

17821736

17823236
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	add	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
the excuse is arguably that at the time the various multiplying instructions were added to the instruction set of the cpu 8086 vintage i think that the existing instruction didn t have any obvious places to put multiplying where it could share the general decoding scheme available to other instructions mov add xor etc that there were not a lot of available transistors to do fancy decoding schemes to enable some other way to encode general operands and that any transistors that were available were better dedicated to the multiplication division logic

17823236
multiplying	add
finally the multiplying instruction is needed rather less often than the general instructions mov add xor and so the effort to move the operands into place results from fixed places doesn t cause a lot of code bloat or impact performance much

i have a parent div whose width and height is unknown and i d like to divide this div into four parts as follows

17826484
persistent	transient	fflush	gets
second a pojo can be either persistent your hibernate session is aware of the object and will save changes to the database when your transaction gets fflush or closed or transient hibernate doesn t know anything about this object and won t save changes to the database

17826484
persistent	transient
calling save makes a transient object persistent and has no effect on a pojo that s already persistent

17826484
persistent	transient
the call to clear does the opposite it takes all persistent objects in the session and makes them non-persistent discarding all changes in the process and it has no effect on pojos that are already transient

17826484
persistent	transient
so when you call save then flush and then clear for each pojo what you re doing is making that one object persistent then forcing the database to write its data to the db and then making it transient

17826484
persistent	transient
if you really wanted to use the approach you ve got here and i ve done it occasionally such as in situations where i wanted to end up with many objects persistent but couldn t reasonably construct a new object for each so i reused the same object changing its properties while it s transient and not tracking those changes and then briefly making it persistent so it ll write the new object to the database the method you d probably want to use is the evict method which lets you remove just one hibernate object from the cache

17826500
width	height
mark the location and width and height of each shape and give them a

17826500

i have drop down select and show hide other fields within divs based on option selected in the dropdown list

17826603
hide	show
this code works fine and show hide based on selection but when i load the page all fields are visible

17826603
hide	show
other thing is for instance if i want to show fields if option 2 selected and save the option to the database and when reload the page it is not saving the show hide state based on the option selected

17826603
hide	show
so how can i write script where all fields are hidden on page load but it will keep show hide state based on selected option

one option would be to use a non-editable uitextview instead of a uilabel

17827248

i ve heard the program running decided but then the question would be what gives the program the ability to decide whether to add or subtract and how is that interpreted to the cpu and alu

17828043

also i ve learned that alu s use one circuit that switches forth between addition and subtraction

17828043
subtract	add
what makes it decide whether to add or subtract

remember you can hot-backup the content-store not the lucene index folder dir and it s not necessary to check every single file for consistency

17828200
subtraction	addition
subtraction is nothing else than addition with the second operand being a negative number

17828200
subtraction	addition
now subtraction is just addition so we can use the same circuits to carry out both functions

17828212

i haven t done it myself but you could try to configure two different executions of the maven-surefire-plugin and configure one of these executions to only run junit tests and the other to only run testng tests

17828435
junit	testng
to differentiate between junit und testng tests you should either put the tests in different directories or use a distinguishable name scheme and configure each of the executions with suitable inclusion and exclusion patterns

17828467
inherited	base-class
an alternative is to inherited but never publicly only with private inherited because stl containers destructor is public and non -virtual then use using-declarations inside the custom class to bring names of base-class functions and types into scope needing only one using base name

17828502
google-chrome	firefox
see the difference in this will work in google-chrome with a warning unsafe javascript attempt to access frame with url but in firefox it will throw error bad npobject as private data

17828539
jobs	cron
actually i think you came up with an interesting use case using a minimal workflow as a centralized locking mechanism for one-off actions in a distributed system - such as cron jobs executed from a single host in a fleet of many the hosts have to first undergo election and whichever wins the lock gets to execute an action

17828547
inherited	properties
it is doable with a bit of reflection just recursively walk all the collections and properties of the entity if they all inherited from the same base class cast them and call the istransient method

17828591
express	node.js

skip the first sub arrays by using a regular for-loop which starts at offset 1 instead of the foreach loops

you re not using loops index i at all in the for-loop

17829071
maple	mupad
the change to mupad is a problem that s been posted numerous times and there is a useful discussion of differences between maple and mupad here

17829071
maple	mupad
most of the implementation would apparently be in parsing the output from mupad and turning it into what maple would generate

17829071
maple	mupad
the input to mupad and maple is apparently equal most of the time but read the doc above

17829071
maple	mupad
to write a translator you redirect calls to maple by placing in your path the following function maple that calls mupad

17829292
rss	feed
the first .get function gets recent news from a rss feed and posts them in a

17829292
rss	feed
the second .get function gets the same things from a different rss feed and posts them in a similar way but the difference is that it also gets image sources and i m drawing these images into elements in the last part of the code

rss	feed
all these function are in the same .js file the images webpage and rss feed are on the same server as the .js file

17829670
hide	show
then add the hide or show according to the bootstraps sliding etc

17829670
hide	show
the above jquery will show and hide every .caption-btm

17829692
post	get
i ve tried setting the itemscontrol to make use of virtualizing as suggested in this post but that s made no difference - as i understand i d only get performance gains this way if i used a lot of scrolling and my control does not scroll

17829711
hash	salt
in addition you could create a random salt registration for each user to set your security level even a bit higher note hash hash hash ... lowers your security level since you lose information during a hash process

when you upgrade the versioning of struts2 you have to update the libraries requires by your application to the target versioning

17830175

the targeted versioning number i ve chosen 2.3.8 but it s possibly incompatible with the other features hibernate and spring which versioning need to upgrade separately by adding corresponding artifacts to the dependencies

17830632
implements	extends
create a new class that extends that abstract class singlebrowserlocator you will have to implements the abstract methods in it

17830632
public	protected
search for a non abstract subclass of singlebrowserlocator that makes that method public or has other public methods that calls the protected one

17830632
subclass	abstract-class
if the method is useful to you and made protected in an abstract-class probably the better or only correct choice is that you will have to implement a new subclass of it the first choice above

17830634
getter	setter
if you would define both a vanilla getter and setter i think it s just as safe to make the variable public and forget about the accessors

17830651
width	height
width of that image should be equal to screen width - circle radius 2 height should

17830653
svg	vml

17844051
public	protected
i feel like they should be protected as public is not an option other classes should nt be accessing it and private doesn t allow me to use the x and y fields from the extended player class

17844051
getter	setter
other sollutions to this other than setting the variable to protected that come into mind would be using getter and setter from the super class which in my opinion is not only a bad practice but completely redundant and unnecesary or re-declaring those attributes in the new class which let s me thinking if i m getting any reward from inheritance if i ll have to type all the field declarations twice

i was thinking maybe i could put all of the fields into a c++ class and have an init function that will return a new instance of it for the ctor of the jniwrapper and from then for each jni function that needs fields it will get this class as a parameter

17844753
width	height
if i made the circle-dimensions percentage-based the circles would turn into ellipses unless the height of the container were equal to the width of the container which is almost never the case an 80 x 80 circle in a 100px x 200px container is actually 80px by 160px

17846248
min	max	range	max	range	min

srp	principles
no one can really help you but yourself i am saying this because the only way to refactor this anti-pattern which is called constructor over-injection and which - by the way - is a symptom of violation of the srp single responsibility principles the only way is to find commonalities between those dependencies and group related ones into their own class

17858414
children	parent
i bet there are quite a few more options i can t think of quickly crux is when your button.click occurs inform the parent in your manner of choosing that it needs to change the state of it s children however it chooses to do so and give the responsibility of actioning that request to the parent view

17858444

it s actually going quite well apart from the fact that the x-axis consistently has a margin that shouldn t be there - i have put it in the css that width is 100 for most properties

17858624

my idea was to put them all in an array and draw randomly from it upon initing to get several sprites with randomly picked graphics

17858964

17859274
button	checkbox
in the inner div with id number2 there will be a checkbox and two small button inline

17859280

folder	dir
try this it reads the folder size with the dir command

17859443

17859818

for-loop	loops
first of all a quick sidebar when you re doing a for-loop it s best to put the increment in loops itself so

17860944
int	chars
it then changes int 49 to chars 49 which is the same value but takes up one byte instead of 4

17860944
int	chars
when i is 10 it now takes the int 58 and converts it to a chars again changing it from 4 bytes to 1 byte

17860944
int	chars
i put 0 as did you above instead of 0 simply because 0 reminds the programmer that we re dealing with a chars array not an int array

this will work on google-chrome and safari but not ipad

17862101

17862436
int	double
i m new to c# coming from java and i d like to check whether a certain object is a number it can be an int double float etc

17862436
int	double
however when the array is stored in a text file the parser i m using can sometimes think it s an int array or a double array

17862436
int	double
sometimes the objects in dblist would parse as int sometimes as double and only rarely as bytes but all i really care about at the end is the byte value

it specifies that the form will be send by post and not by get

17862720
google-chrome	firefox
the selenium driver should connect you up to the browser and the browser be it firefox google-chrome or simplebrowser should automatically add the host header

17862742
int	chars
you re reading an int into a chars

17862742
int	chars
you should use the i format specifier for int arguments and the c for chars arguments

17862783

this code above print 1 which means whenever we create an instance of a child class and assign value to properties inherited from its parent the properties in its parent class also has been assigned.but the code below shows different

17862814
post	put
if you think about the task as a pile of photos sitting on a desk the folder and the threads as employees running errands for you then having one employee fetch a photo from the desk put it in an envelope and bring it to the post office for each photo is going to take forever

17862857
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
brian mentioned that ios6 gives the rotation control to the rootviewcontroller - this could not only be a uinavigationcontroller as mentioned but also a uitabbarcontroller which it was for me

17862857
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so i added the methods first in a custom uitabbarcontroller then in a custom uinavigationcontroller and then lastly in the specific uiviewcontroller

17862857
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
example from the uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

17862878
ssl	https
this forum is probably not the right place to describe session negotiation and the ssl handshake again but you can be sure that you only need a server side key for the purpose you describe above take any website as an example if you go to google mail their https encryption works through them having a private key and a certified signed public key you have no client side certification but provide your username and password through the encrypted connection to them

17862905
post	get
you want to use unless ur doing some ajax stuff or submitting long urls to a separate processing form which instead of the post method below use and name the form contact.php as you specified and do some calls via ajax to get the loading spinner and everything integrated

sorting	grouping
if you want to grouping sorting by no asterisks then all with 1 then all with 2 etc and then inside each grouping sort alphabetically then you probably want something like this

17863004
width	height
one of the examples is given a quad with 4 vertices the texture coordinates are 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 on it and the texture s width and height are 640 and 480

17863006
width	text-align
i ve attempted using text-align floats absolute positioning and the css brilliance explained at fluid width with equally spaced divs .

17863084
nsstring	nsdata
i imagine it would be more efficient to encourage parsing nsdata instead of nsstring

17863084
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
if you are parsing a response from a server for example you ll get an nsdata object representing a buffer of raw bytes returned from the server note that nsjsonserialization also includes a method for parsing an nsinputstream directly

17863084
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
instead nsjsonserialization is probably parsing the bytes in the nsdata object directly and only construct nsstrings for the appropriate keys and values in the resulting data structure

17863102
superclass	subclassing
i m having some trouble finding the specifics on what happens when you return a subclassing in a method of superclass type in java

subclassing is extension of superclass

17863340
width	height
based on a label s content and its uifont you can calculate its width and height

17863350
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
you can request the nsdata from the url and then use nsjsonserialization to interpret it

17863356
superclass	subclassing
however if you take that returned value and attempt to downcast it to subclassing the cast will succeed and you will find the field methods from subclassing will work as you expect without any loss of information from having been returned as superclass

17863422
google-chrome	safari
in ie google-chrome and safari the order is onselection onblur

17863458

17863527
ubuntu	linux
i m working on a little side project on linux ubuntu where i require one to be authenticated to access a service

debian	linux
gnu screen is available as a package on debian and probably most linux distributions

17863704
superclass	subclassing
casting does not fundamentally change an object to a different type it simply tells the compiler to view the object as its superclass or subclassing when downcasting

17863704
superclass	subclassing
in your example superobj is still an instance of the subclassing type but it now appears to be a superclass

17863704
superclass	subclassing
although sisterclass is a subclassing of superclass superobj is not an instance of sisterclass

17863712
instances	transient
based on the answers in this question cyclic dependency with ninject and this questions ninject give the parent instances to a child being resolved both of these say you can use two way property injection to resolve cyclic dependencies as long as you change the scope to not be the default transient scope

17863799
folder	directory
adb should detect your device to check this open window command prompt change directory to android sdk folder by cd command then go to platform-tools then this command adb kill-server then adb devices

woocommerce	shopp
if you are looking to charge users on your wordpress site instead of using the infusionsoft shopp cart you can try payment gateway for woocommerce

17864176
free	malloc
also there is no problem in re-allocating space for a free pointer since malloc will return a pointer to the new memory block and you ll assign your previously free pointer to the one returned my malloc

17864196
for-loop	arrays
assuming you are given an arrays which contains one instance of value a and all other values are b then you can do this with a single for-loop

i have imageviews inside of a gridview i had been using an onitemclicklistener along with an onitemlongclicklistener set on the gridview to open the image on a larger page and to delete the item respectively

17864958
move	drag
now i have to implement rearranging of the imageviews in the gridview so i plan to move the deletion function to a double tap gesture please do not lecture me on android style guidelines including the possibility of contextual actionbars which i suggested as this is what my boss asks for to emulate functions inside our ios app in order to reserve long click for the drag and drop

17864958

17865265
stdout	stderr
aren t they both saying the same thing send stderr to stdout and send stdout to file

17865274
width	height
your main issue is you are searching the html source for references to height and width

17865274
width	height
in most cases when things are done well images don t have height and width specified in html in which case they are rendered at the height and width of the image file itself

17865274
width	height
to get the height and width of the image file you need to actually query for and load that file then check the height and width using image processing

17865320
cpu	processors
an instruction set exists for all processing units including graphics processing cores networking card processors as well at the cpu

17865320
cpu	processors
each digital logic process which a processors can perform has an binary instruction code which caused the cpu to execute that exact instruction

17865320
x86	64bit
for example the x86_64 instruction set for intel cpu s includes additional 64bit instructions among others for manipulating data 64bit wide inside the cpu s core which is an extension to the x86 32 bit capabilities of previous intel cpu generations

17865348

this occurs only in the webkit browsers google-chrome safari opera and not in firefox

17865529
int	double
similar to what happens when you declare an int double or other

17865549
min	max
what i need is to insert all the missing years between min year and max year and to make sure that the order is preserved

17865549
min	max
moreover if any sublist contains only a single item then the same process should be applied to it so that the original value preserves its supposed order and rest of the min to max year value items are inserted properly

17865552
hide	show
according to the documentation jquery.toggle is used to show hide elements it does not work by toggling between two functions as you seem to intend so what you were doing was toggling the visibility of the element toggle comes with a shrinking animation before it hide and that is what you were seeing

17865555
mdpi	hdpi
first i d highly recommend you get the proper size images for at least mdpi hdpi and xhdpi

17865555
mdpi	hdpi
mdpi is drawn with the standard 72 resolution and then comparatively hdpi is 1.5x mdpi and xhdpi is 2.0x mdpi

17865565
min	max
and your divide and conquer would build subsets of the min max indices

17865576
width	height
i only want to animate the height width of the object

17865576
width	height
instead of all i have tried settings width height but it doesn t smoothly animate anymore

17865581
rspec	capybara
to quote the capybara documentation for use in rspec

rspec	capybara
further in rspec describe blocks whether expressed through describe context or the capybara alias feature can be nested arbitrarily deeply

17865611
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
if memory serves me right touchesmoved will only be called when touchesbegan method reaches the end - touches will be buffered though

17865686
post	get
i am trying to use post method to post the specified data to the server and get some data message in return

17865693
try-catch	exception-handling
..the idea is that we use ftpwebrequest class and pass the folder name with a trailing slash if the folder is found then the response will be processed fine inside try-catch block if the folder could not be found we handle the exception-handling controlling with statuscode actionnottakenfileunavailable to determine if absence of folder causes exception-handling

17865698
inherited	properties
what i had to do was to create a class that inherited from system.componentmodel.displaynameattribute name it displaynameattribute to override parent class and overwrite parent class constructor displayname and displaynamevalue properties

17865712
short	base
the long and short of it is that i want to store these data in a data base for myriad reasons space efficiency and ease of access considerations among many others

17865712
mongodb	bson
as an example here s what i sketched as a potential mongodb bson structure for a subject

17865726
int	double
edit after changing the obvious error on my behalf to change the type of to a double instead of an int my new answer is now 10948824009217039033385554100376102490822180576034479094375076006115616972742335036083272081670698970658879817383936.000000 which is still not my answer any other

17865747
inherited	properties
now any route that inherited from gjkroutebuilder and has the proper values wired up through spring will have the properties injected into the properties component as if they were coming right from a properties file

17865749
int	double
if you re okay with the possibility of rounding errors which you might get with your floating-point literals anyway then you can simply use the double data type instead of int

17865762
qtreeview	qfilesystemmodel
i have a simple qtreeview with a qfilesystemmodel pointing to the root directory

17865767
dictionary	map
need for now i have been passing roman value to convert its related value but now i will have input as provided above in dictionary which map with roman number

17865768
inherited	properties
ownablespaceobject has resources ships structures as properties each of these are their own class which inherited from nothing ships and structures are icollections

17865848
rvm	chruby
while i use chruby for ruby versioning instead of rvm i only need ruby 2.0 for my project

17865853
range	minimum
a sub optimal and simple to code suffix array solution will have o llg 2 l l string length construction time and o 1 time to query longest common prefix of 2 suffixes using range minimum query

17865860
hash	md5
instance a filename can be a md5 hash of the name of file plus the

nsstring	nsdata
how much memory will be occupied when we are creating each variable like int nsstring nsdictionary nsdata etc

17865938
mouseover	mouseout
and because they are running processing.js and they can get heavy i applied a mouseover and mouseout event to both buttons in jquery like so

17865973
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the alternative is just to run your own query presumably in viewdidload or viewwillappear or similar

17865999
getter	setter
intellij informs me cannot resolve property notneededformydataservicetest apparently because there are no getter and setter for that field

17866011
many-to-many	one-to-many
every schema i ve looked at for sql databases show one-to-many or many-to-many type scenarios

17866043
int	boolean
the second param of maketext takes either a charsequence or an int but you have a boolean in there with ischecked so you need to determine what that should be before this line and use true or false or whatever you want but it needs to be a charsequence

17866075
put	get
using a jsonrest not a jsonreststore i make a put request to an end point and get the result back and gather location information from the request response like so

17866107
websphere	ibm
i believe this thread will have the information you need ibm websphere jpa configuration - how to update persistence.xml

17866112
width	height
so if you re drawing a fullscreen quad the texture you re sampling is the same size of the render target and you re using a point sampler the texture will be sampled width height times once per pixel

17866123
nsstring	nsdata
it depends of content you would like to put into this classes nsstring nsdictionary nsdata

17866142
pop-up	dialog
a custom chooser dialog pop-up will be better for you in this case

17866247
width	height
in particular i want a new variables with the height and width of the first digit written then the height and width of the second etc. as spss vars

17866253
jtextfield	jtable
my experience is that java swing jtextfield and jtable gui controls escape user-entered backslashes by prefixing a backslash

17866289
express	node.js
i don t know if this a really noob question but i have seen a lot of documentation about use express in node.js and express

17866301
width	height
a full width fixed height header

17866301
width	height
a slider that stretches full width and full height - minus the height of the header

17866307
explode	implode
you can simply implode the results of an explode

17866314
post	get
the key is the .filter for what ajax get post returns

17866561
google-chrome	firefox
however both firefox and google-chrome give me the same strange result when using calc like this

17866590
put	get
when i put a printf statement before or after assigning a computed value to an array i get correct answer

17866591
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
what i had tried among other things was setting the uiwindow in my appdelegate class to be my instance of a subclass bicyclefamilyacitivityviewcontroller of uiviewcontroller

17866633
folder	directory
what i understand is that you are having all the required images in a directory structure inside your project folder

17866633
folder	directory
first step is to drag and add resources directory to the app bundle like to the supporting files and then choose option create folder references for any added folder

17866673
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd will be asked in a normal manner no need to omit that

17866737
listview	flipview	listview	gridview
controls including listview gridview flipview listbox and

17866737
listview	gridview
these examples use the listview and gridview

17866747
min	max
i also am checking for a count of all rows beyond the last queries limit a count on distinct category id s and now i just need a min max hopefully in the same query

17866747
min	max
the problem i see is that its from a joined query so i would need to join match every connected id then check the number i want to min max

17866747
min	max
i only need one result for the min and max so i might as well add it with my count query because it must also bypass the limit portion of the main query

17866747
min	max
to extend my question slightly the max needs to be the highest returned min value but that is less important

17866751
width	height
the variables w and h will then store the table s width and height respectively

17866798
mouse	keyboard
however when i click on keyboard or mouse image the decimal place is roughly ten digits long for example 36.900000000000006

17866827
post	get
i didn t have any code to enter here when i first posted the question but i was able to get something to work so i ll post it now

17866833
addclass	removeclass
when you re using addclass removeclass and toggleclass

17866838
min	max
there fore you should order by product id and select max price min price

17866838
min	max
maybe you have to do two seperate queries if it doesn t allow you to select the min and max in the same sql satement

17866838
min	max
select name max price min price from products join

17866954
integer	unsigned
key 64-bit unsigned integer

17866975
setinterval	settimeout
you ll want to use setinterval not settimeout

17867022
folder	directory
i m making a game and that game requires a certain directory to be made in the appdata folder of the user s account

17867106
fileoutputstream	gzipoutputstream
i don t think you are properly closing both the fileoutputstream and the gzipoutputstream

17867112
google-chrome	safari
here s a javascript tool i use on safari and google-chrome though i m not sure how it works in ie

17867124
width	height
holder.js create data-src image preview when an image have src holder.js # width x# height

17867134
neo4j	titan
i think both titan and neo4j are right neo4j tries to provide a graph database for general purpose so you have multiple solutions depending on how you use it and they can t know how people will use it so they apply the more common solution replicating the entire dataset

17867134
neo4j	titan
i never used titan but a good test would be to compare its performance with neo4j depending of the depth of the queries

17867154
int	chars
-- the rank of long long int shall be greater than the rank of long int which shall be greater than the rank of int which shall be greater than the rank of short int which shall be greater than the rank of signed chars

17867154
integer	unsigned
-- the rank of any unsigned integer type shall equal the rank of the corresponding

17867154
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

17867154
int	chars
the range of chars is guaranteed to be the same range as that of signed chars or unsigned chars which are both subranges of int and unsigned int respectively as a result of their smaller int conversion rank

17867154
int	chars
for example could the following code result in implementation-defined behavior since chars could be defined as a signed int type

17867157
width	height
adding height width to the span that inhereits

17867161
implements	extends	superclass	subclassing
i have a class called subclassing for simplicity that extends superclass and implements iclass

17867161
superclass	subclassing
i would like to call subclassing implementedmethod which it gets from iclass from superclass

17867180
box-sizing	border-box
btw if you are so opposed to the default box model why not use the box-sizing border-box which would be a lot easier then calculating all the time especially if you start playing around with the css

17867190
button	checkbox
i think immediate autosave is a vastly superior interaction pattern so when you check any checkbox i send an ajax put and your change is saved immediately without a submit button or full page load

17867202
post	put
i put together a small sample app with fixtures tests based on the blog post

17867205
hide	show
of course you can still show hide the instance but attempting to actually remove it through a fragmenttransaction will simply not work

17867209
superclass	subclassing
the only way to call that method would be to create an object of type subclassing in superclass and call subclassinstance.implementedmethod

17867209
superclass	subclassing
as stated in a comment on your question you should reconsider your class designs if your superclass needs to call a subclassing method

17867213
nsurl	nsstring
however when i change to a m4a file the nsstring path returns nil like it is not able to find the path to my file and thus the nsurl is not formed

17867230
int	chars
-1 as a signed chars will be promoted to a signed int which will retain its -1 value

17867244

children	parent
having a protected variable means you are allowed to modify it into parent or children classes remember every single instance of each class has its own property values

17881627
width	height
i have probably very common question search it all over tried pretty much everything display block zoom 1 set height width nothing worked

17881635
superclass	subclassing
in general in oop it is common to override superclass methods in subclassing as well as modifying superclass instance variables as long as you know what the variable you are modifying is being used for you don t want to be randomly changing instance variables in classes that you don t completely understand or don t have access to the source of because you don t want any unfortunate side effects so when it s your own code this is absolutely fine

17881635
superclass	subclassing
as a general guideline if your options are either to copy and paste a massive hunk of code and use it unchanged or subclassing and use the superclass instance variables or functions it s better to subclassing

17881661
superclass	subclassing
changing the value in subclassing will not affect superclass variable

17881662
getter	setter
thus avoids a lot of setter getter which you else had to make at least package private and thus sharing with more than the private class

17881726
submit	submission
i had a submit button originally and it was just submission the form

17881752
folder	directory
meaning does it increase linearly polynomial exponentially depending upon number of folder file in the directory being checked against

17881758
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this solution works cross browser and has been tested in firefox v19 google-chrome v24 and safari v5.1.7 on windows

17881820
versioning	upgrade
this would be a process versioning upgrade ...

17881888
daemons	systemd
and as the spec specifies when only daemons threads are running the systemd will exit

17881923
google-chrome	firefox
the following simplified code renders as expected in ie10 and firefox 21 but in current google-chrome version 28.0.1500.72 shadows near the column sides are trimmed

17881923
google-chrome	firefox
the images present results in ie firefox on the left and google-chrome on the right

17881954
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested on firefox google-chrome and ie

17881986
spaces	delimiter
if you wanted to use spaces for delimiter instead of commas configure your csv.writer to use a different delimiter

17882035
width	margin
i want to make a view with fixed width fixed right margin and flexible left margin

17882035
width	margin
from the document i chose to use uiviewautoresizingflexibleleftmargin but it presents flex margin left proportionally meanwhile flex margin right and fixed width

17882036
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
both are very fast faster than jsonkit and nsjsonserialization support sax style parsing and can process json in chunks as nsdata objects

17882040
for-loop	loops
the first for-loop increments by 10 and there is a foreach loops inside it

17882048
rss	feed
i have a problem generating valid xml file for rss feed with php

17882066
inherited	subclassing
depending on whether these classes just share behavior interface or are actually subclassing of a common class you should use either a mixin or prototypal inherited respectively

17882071
hide	show
i have a menu that show up and hide with transition effects

17882108
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the best workaround i found for this is to create the uinavigationcontroller without a root controller add it to the window then push the uitabbarcontroller

17882116
folder	directory
i m having a directory which is having the folder with the name of date format

17882120
viewdidload	viewwillappear
instead of getting setting bounds size in viewdidload perform the codes in viewwillappear

17882203
width	height
i have a uiwebview containing some html where the containing div s width and height are set to 100

17882209
width	height
as said this should work if you add content width height and position to the pseudo elements but if i were you i would revise your css

17882241
maven	pom.xml
only with the maven pom.xml you ll have a bundle that contains a valid manifest unless you added this yourself which i didn t see in your description

17882305
fadein	hide
fadein and .fadeout does the .show and hide themselves

17882324
min	max
i need to fetch the nodes with a few user input values first and foremost max and min hours these can both have values between -1 and 40

17882324
min	max
i want to fetch all the nodes between min and max but also want to be considering that one or both of those values can be empty -1 and then i need all the nodes

17882326
int	chars
signed chars corresponds to signed int

17882326
int	chars
unsigned chars corresponds to unsigned int

17882326
int	chars
if so does that imply that an implementation could theoretically have an unsigned chars value which is not in the subrange of an int

17882338
width	height
note when using em s you should have a base em that all others including width height and other font sizes are based off of

17882396
children	parent
if the parent is in-control of both the children then the triggers or buttons for child services should be delegated to the parent

17882396
children	parent
infact in your case it seems parent should be the only interface between children and the outside world

17882441
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so when you nslog in viewdidload the view i not yet loaded so viewcontroller has not shrinked the frame yet but in viewdidappear it has done the resizing

17882452
user-controls	elementhost
i have a form of form1 class and a wpf user-controls inside it inside elementhost

17882459
serializable	deserialization
creating your own textual or binary format requires defining your own file format and therefore writing your own serializable and deserialization methods

17882460
int	chars
implementations will promote to unsigned int if not all unsigned chars values are representable in an int as ruled by 6.2.5p9 in c99

17882484
google-chrome	firefox
neither google-chrome nor firefox support such a behaviour

17882484
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox will list the drive s content in the browser instead of opening windows-explorer

17882487
width	margin
p.s.alter the margin and width values by yourself to make the boxes closer as per your requirement

17882488
viewdidload	viewdidappear
for example if you are loading the view from an ib file the frame you will get in the viewdidload is the one you have in the ib file but maybe the final size for your view is smaller bigger and then you will get another one in your viewdidappear

17882580
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox seems to be ok

17882586
stdout	stderr
when you close the standard file descriptors stdin stdout stderr those file descriptors may then be reused by the next call to open

17882634
xjc	wsdl2java
i can pass the -b parameter to xjc through the wsdl2java invocation example 7 and when i do that the enum type is generated correctly according to the bindings file but the field that uses it --- person.educationlevel in the example at --- has type string not educationleveltype as it should

17882661
width	height
i m designing user interface for an app that is gonna have versions for both android and ios i m gonna design two interfaces one for android and one for ios but i don t know what ratio should i use for my screen height and width regarding so many different devices that support android or ios

17882668
superclass	subclassing
you will get a compiler error if the superclass method s signature changes in a way that the subclassing method does in fact not override it anymore

17882682
google-chrome	safari
all webkit browsers safari google-chrome android browser etc

17882682
google-chrome	safari
for example if you are using google-chrome or safari

17882715
jsf	tapestry
but i m afraid i may waste my time learning specs that i won t need or that i m already using a replacement for i.e tapestry 5 servlets jsp jsf ioc datanucleus jdo jpa jdbc

17882795
put	get
i can put the model into the collection easily but when i try to read queried models i get the following mongodb.bson.bsonserializationexception

17882803
getter	setter
and then your response would need to have a getter and a setter for the response code somewhere to check the result

17882872
width	height
the canvas variable is a jquery object and width and height are function calls not properties

17882890
for-loop	loops
just change your parsertask input parameters and put everything inside a for-loop to loops through each json string

17882914
post	get
i searched in google and check all the post but i did not get any solution

17882972
free	malloc
i know that if you are using pointers to explicitely allocate memory using malloc then it is good practice to free that pointer using free ptr

17882976
int	chars
declare function chars int as a c function using extern c

17882976
int	chars
extern c void function chars c int i

17882976
int	chars
implement function chars int in c++ module

17882976
int	chars
void function chars c int i

17883008
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
hence it is advised to request bounds sizes in the viewwillappear viewdidappear methods

17883044
free	malloc
you only need to free memory allocated with malloc the other cases you specified are pointers to string literals or automatic variables usually allocated on the stack attempting to free them is undefined behavior

17883055
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
found a solution working in firefox chromium safari and opera ie untested

17883058
free	malloc
you should only ever call free when passing something allocated with a call to malloc

17883064
free	malloc
only ptr2 needs to be free - it s the only one you allocated with malloc

17883065
post	get
i would like to get post_ids of user s post using fql query

17883065
post	get
i would need to get user s post post_id also when fb user is offline

17883086
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
no its illegal to free memory which are not returned by malloc or calloc or realloc

17883119
ssl	https
must be over a ssl https try change the jquery-link

17883164
width	height
is a jquery wrapped element with a width and height

17883183
free	malloc
you only have to free memory yo have allocated using malloc when you declare a static array memory is free automatically at the end of the code block

17883229
subtract	add
this function can add and subtract business days regardless of the value of datefirst

17883267
width	height
one reason which i m not sure is the case here is it allows for spriting in which you have one image with about 15 important graphics on it and then use css to tell a to display a particular width height of that image at a certain x y offset

17883280
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly on firefox and google-chrome but on ie the image doesn t get stretched at all

17883291
division	multiplication
floating point multiplication usually takes fewer cycles than floating point division

17883302
office365	outlook.com
i ve been hearing a ton of bad things about office365 and the new outlook.com with anchor links

17883309
fadein	fadeout
it still sort of slides with the carousel but you do get the fadeout and fadein affect

17883322
cos	sin
it includes adding in functions for sin cos tan and abs

17883349
int	boolean
by the same token when you add an int or a boolean they re added as int and boolean not strings

17883373
width	height
the kicker is that the images are not all going to be the same height or width

17883373
width	height
although the height and width dimensions will be between 100px and 300px in almost every case

17883373
super	implements
if it were just me updating the page div s would be super easy to implements

17883414
min	max
you can then use rand min max to go into the seed and choose a number between the min and the max inclusive

17883417
int	double
this is the case of int and double one can t be used as another

17883463
exponent	addition	multiplying	addition
while there are more 0 s in the long.tobinarystring l multiplying by addition 0 s will not change the result the differing position of the 1 in the beginning is due to the 8-bit vs 11-bit biased exponent issue

17883470
backbone.js	zepto
backbone.js relies on jquery or zepto for dom manipulation

17883476
wadl	wsdl
but one major difference is in resteasy it is very difficult to generate the wadl api.especially when the customers want to check the rest api calls. the wadl will help a lot like wsdl

17883560
post	get
it looks to me like you are sending a post request to a server that is expecting a get

17883560
post	get
you can convert your post request to a get request and get rid of the basichttpparams by replacing the first few lines of getjsonfromurl like this

17883566
put	get	post	get	post	put
when in doubt make a new restful entity with get post and optionally put and delete

17883566
put	get	post	get	post	put
you have an order entity which you can get post put or delete on

17883566
post	get
the idea would be that you would be able to get a customers total orders by using get customers id orders or get the details about a specific order using orders id or customers id orders id or even create a new order by using post customers id orders

17883577
division	multiplication
multiplication is faster than division

17883577
division	multiplication
at university i was taught that division takes six times that of multiplication

17883577
division	multiplication
the actual timings are architecture dependent but in general multiplication will never be slower or even as slow as division

17883618
hide	fadeout
well change the hide to fadeout and then change the 5000 to 3000

17883620
base	fractions
a similar effect happens with base 10 decimals and the fractions 2 3

17883630
hide	show
to get solution i had to slightly modify my original implementation i ve replaced assigning nil to inputview member of my main view with creating and destroying custom invisible view to show and hide keyboard correspondingly

17883640
int	chars
for these cases int promotion may dictate that the chars to be promoted to unsigned int on some implementations

17883655
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the cropping seems to happen consistently in google-chrome 30 firefox 25 and opera 12

17883678
modifiers	sealed
code extendability no difference regarding static members at least - of course you can extend the class with none-static members if you don t use the static modifiers but with the static modifiers the class is implicitly sealed

17883688
getter	setter
they are not getter and setter

17883688
getter	setter
i m talking about how people expect getter and setter to behave .

17883689
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql are both sensible options which allow connections over a network and should make it easier for multiple machines to access the database at once although they require considerably more setup than sqlite

17883689
udp	tcp
you might also consider using udp instead of tcp if you don t need to send data more of just a wake up call

17883689
udp	tcp
bear in mind that udp makes no guarantees about reliability however and you ll probably find many more tutorials and documentation about tcp sockets than udp ones

17883705
goto	break
you can use goto once instead of multiple break which just exists the innermost loop

17883705
goto	break
nevertheless in my opinion break is not much better than goto its both not a good programming style

17883732
int	chars
for example if chars is an unsigned type with not all chars values representable in an int like in this implementation the default argument promotion is done to unsigned int

17883734
jar	manifest.mf
if you re unsure about the version because it s not mentioned in jar s filename extract it using a zip tool and look in meta-inf manifest.mf

superclass	subclassing
i want to be able to pass any subclassing of mysuperclass to setpropterties and return it after setting some properties in the superclass

17884146
src	attr
there is no src property to be set in css but a content property however it doesn t seem to accept an url fetched using attr respectively it doesn t seem to be implemented by any browser yet

17884183
superclass	subclassing
i want to be able to pass any subclassing of mysuperclass to setpropterties and return it after setting some properties in the superclass

17884202
wan	lan
but that doesn t mean it s an easy fix - what if the box has multiple ips nics wan lan etc..

17884204
onchange	onkeyup	onchange	keyup
btw as you were already binding onkeyup and onchange bound onpaste instead which should give finally quite the same behaviour as oninput used with keyup change

17884222
opera	google-chrome
you can do this without modifying your markup but support is extremely limited due to the fact that only 3 browsers support wrapping in flexbox opera google-chrome ie10

17884230
margin	font-size
you could also do negative margin on the li but i personally like the font-size 0 since you have no text anyway

17884313
uilabel	uitextview
the hello world is a different uilabel which background color as black with alpha 0.0 and the message part is a uitextview with background color as black with alpha 0.0

17884345
gif	png
i want to add width attribute to gif file in img tag containing png and jpg using jquery

this transition is smooth in google-chrome but firefox and ie change it from one to another without smooth transition

17884386
matplotlib	scipy
i need to compile from source scipy numpy and matplotlib which would work with python3

17884388
width	height
since the simplemodal dialog will enclose the modal container applying width and height to the simplemodal-container class in an across-the-board manner wasn t feasible

17884422
width	height
my friend can now upload images of different sizes again probably between 100px and 300px in height and width and the css will take care of formatting

17884470
folder	directory
you can delete data db or wherever your data directory resides and create new folder again with the same name data db

17884470
folder	directory
after that goto the directory where data folder resides and start mongo server with mongod command

17884481
filtering	grouping
my ssrs is a table with 5 grouping and i have a parameter that filtering group1 column

post	get
the post redirect get solution is valid if it works for you

17884540
csv	tsv
i have a script here that is meant to convert csv formatted data to tsv

17884552
persistent	transient
as for the retrieving of a specific entity b you could have another relationship to entity b but this time just a 1 to 1 relationship say specialrelationship for example and tick the transient box this just means that the data isn t stored in the persistent store but is determined programmatically

17884555
width	height
the problem is the thumbnail is not squared the function after set kcgimagesourcethumbnailmaxpixelsize key to 90 seems only to resize the image s height and as far as i know the kcgimagesourcethumbnailmaxpixelsize key should be responsible for setting the height and width of the thumbnail

17884597
folder	directory
if this installation was copied from a previous application delete the files folder in the tmp directory and recreated them and all the subfolders e.g cache + models persistent views and logs

17884597
777	tmp
make sure that the tmp directory is write-able chmod -r 777

17884616
google-chrome	firefox
the below code is working fine on google-chrome firefox ie9 ie10

17884618
wtl	atl
you cannot fix atl _patlmodule problem with wtl cappmodule because the two are unrelated atlthough have certain similarity between

17884618
wtl	atl
having this atl wtl issue resolved you can move on to the wtl message loop thing where you expect pretranslatemessage to be called on modal dialog message loop and it won t be called there because it is not expected to work this way cmessageloop calls message filter chain and modal dialog s loop don t

17884671
int	chars
in the very rare case that plain chars is unsigned and which implies a chars argument is promoted to unsigned int which can cause undefined behavior

17884671
int	chars
a chars constant is already of type int so printf c x is well defined even on exotic systems

17884671
integer	unsigned
different unsigned integer type designated with the keyword

17884671
integer	unsigned
of the corresponding unsigned integer type and the representation of

joomla	concrete
i ve seen and understand how to fix this issues in joomla 1.5 but no concrete answers for 3.1 that have worked

17885022
width	height
the problem that i face is while the width of the window changes the first column which includes the first block with text gets a higher height and then it becomes something like this at a different size but in this sketch i kept the same aspect in order to see it

17885047
textview	imageview
i m building a listview with either textview s or imageview s based on whether or not the item is a text item or has an image associated with it

17885047
textview	imageview
so my xml contains two elements - a textview to display the title of the text items and an imageview to display the resource file for videos i retrieve the youtube default image for the video id

17885047
textview	imageview
so the title of each item is displayed because that is always bound to the textview element but when there is no resource listed in my database null is in the record in the resource field then the imageview also disappears

17885047
textview	imageview
this is becase the view of the customviewbinder seems to always be the imageview in my xml rather than ever being the textview

17885077
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
calculate your cell height with its contents margin padding line width and return it

17885081

i m trying to run a mincut algorithm for a class and this works on smaller test cases but whenever i put a bigger test case eventually leading up to the assignment problem i get this error

17885089
hide	show
so iv gotten it working but i need the show products text to appear to hide products s when it is clicked

17885124
implements	extends
my workaround for this was to have only one class extends simpleongesturelistener and implements ontouchlistener

17885124
implements	extends
one class was extends simpleongesturelistener while the other class was implements ontouchlistener but both were handling on touch events

17885146
jtable	jprogressbar
i m trying to set a jprogressbar cell renderer on a jtable column

17885219
google-chrome	safari
it does not work in ie google-chrome and safari

17885280
post	get
if the parameter category is read from the get or post parameters it should be escaped

17885301
prepare	execute
finally now that you have the statement and the parameters use the previously created variable to prepare and execute the statement

17885326
profiling	instrumentation
the instrumentation time profiling showed that each time the action was executed a particular function was taking twice as long as the time before until quickly the app would hang if the action was performed repeatedly

capitalize	uppercase
the keywords variable is likely to always be lowercase however the word in the document may be uppercase or capitalize

17885352
json.net	jsonfx

17885357
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
and it does with google-chrome on mac google-chrome on win8 firefox on mac and safari on ios and in our app in ios too

17885445
width	height
i tried in many ways but i have many problems if the image has more height than width in those cases image should be displayed centered and the remaining space with the background color of the container div i don t want to crop the image

17885454

would it be more efficient to just add to or subtract from the score value each time that an upvote or downvote is given

17890187
post	get
that will give you direct access to the headers that come back in the response to your credential post and then you can copy whatever headers including the cookie header onto your next httpwebrequest to get what you re really after

17890197
gentoo	linux
for example when i link against boost_system on gentoo linux i don t have to link against pthread since boost_system links against pthread on its own

17890324
put	get
if i put both the dropdowns in the same and start the form in that the script will work but i can t get the rest of the table information

17890338
int	chars
in c you have nice literals for primitive types like int and chars and even string literals

17890342
jobs	cron
also i think this is somehow an abuse of a .war file - it s meant to be a deployable application unit although there s lately the ability to run it standalone with migrations java -jar my.war -s rake db migrate setting up cron jobs from a .war sounds a bit too much but if you really want it you now can using rake tasks

17890393
stdout	stderr
its only there as a convenience method if you want to read stdout stderr to completion

17890397
stdout	stderr
you re calling communicate on p2 whose stdout output is sent to f an opened file and whose stderr outputâ which is probably empty anyway no errors occur â is not being sent to a pipe

17890397
stdout	stderr
thus p2.communicate would at worst have to read and buffer-up a grand total of zero bytes of stdout plus zero bytes of stderr

17890438
getter	setter
i write my own setter and getter

17890438
getter	setter
i then call the setter on a nsmanagedobject to change its primitive value but because of the way the custom getter is written it s still returning the old value primitive value has been modified

17890449
nunit	mstest
resharper executes solution-wide static code analysis error detection on-the-fly without the need to compile provides additional features for error correction code completion navigation search syntax highlighting formatting code generation and optimization carries out 40 automated refactorings and streamlines unit testing using nunit and mstest among other features

17890490
int	chars
conceptually as like you assigns string to a chars pointer in c similarly you are assigning an array of int to p of type

17890542
post	get
what s happening is the get retrieves the wordpress hook to print the site url in this case it prints for the 1st call 2nd should print ajax-post-fold and the last call should print the post id so the entire url ends up printing as

17890542
put	get
i ve put this variable into place and called it rather than the as the get reference

17890545
children	parent
you d need to either set each individual child to hidden as well or wrap the children again in another div with visibility visible and toggle that to hidden instead of the parent

17890567
jquery	simplemodal
i m a total jquery noob and i m trying to use eric martin s simplemodal confirm override dialog box in an asp.net web page

17890586
hide	show
i need to be able to show and hide this video using the jquery show and hide but when i do the following the video no longer loads

17890612
hide	show
this would be fine except that the chart is suppose to show up as the first thing the user sees and since it s meant to be seen on a mobile device it s likely they will not see the chart because their first interaction will be clicking a button that hide the chart to show other information

17890630
free	strdup
if there s a reason why you really need to return a copy of the string instead you could return strdup snd_mixer_selem_get_name elem and remember that the caller will be responsible for calling free on the return value

17890632
google-chrome	safari
what i ve found is that it takes google-chrome safari far longer to lay out the div if it s hindi text versus the other two

17890637
maven	m2e
i recently installed plugin m2e - maven integration into eclipse

17890637
maven	pom.xml
i created a maven project a simple pom.xml and added a local repository url in it

17890637
maven	pom.xml
however when i go to dependency section of pom.xml in eclipse click on add and try to search for a library the results are from default maven repository and not from local repository

17890646
infobox	infowindow
the fact is with infowindow it worked perfectly but i want to style them and that s the reason i ve switched to infobox

17890668
rsa	dsa
remember - it must be only your public file either an rsa or dsa key is fine

17890703
jruby	mri
it could be different between mri rubinus jruby

17890717
put	get
in the specific case the short answer is so long as you only put that #define in the .i file and then only in a place where it doesn t get passed out to your generated module_wrap.c you re fine

17890740
getter	setter
i know that yii implements magic getter and setter for class properties so i would access this way

17890740
getter	setter
if the requested value is a key in the applications array then i would have to create an object so i can use the operator and another magic setter getter but i really don t know how yet

17890767
postgresql	mysql
if you connect to mysql or postgresql make sure you google it for the proper driver

17890767
postgresql	mysql
mysql-connector.jar for mysql and postgresql.jdbc4.jar or postgresql

17890783
width	height
you don t need the apply_filters just assign the width and height to integers like

17890802
google-chrome	firefox
my ajax call works fine in google-chrome but when i test it out in firefox or ie i receive a null response

17890947
post	get
post methods are ok to any domain just redirect get methods

17890982
for-loop	loops
i m going to suggest a slightly different solution - that being use a cursor for-loop instead of a standalone cursor and exit loops after a single iteration

17891021
hebrew	thai
there is a bug in qt embedded rendering engine for some reasons it uses qpf2 font engine qfontengineqpf for rendering text in broken scripts hebrew arabic thai korean in my case

description resource path location type program g++ not found in path preferences c++ build settings discovery cdt gcc builtin compiler settings options c c++ scanner discovery problem

17891104
width	height
the silent defaults for the filter region are x -10 y -10 width 120 height 120 - large blurs usually get clipped

17891104
width	height
your shadow isn t getting clipped horizontally because your width is about 2.5x your height - so that 10 results in a wider horizontal filter region

17891104
width	height
please note that if your particular shape is either zero width or zero height a horizontal or vertical line then you must specify as part of the filter declaration and explicitly specify a filter region x y width height in userspaceunits usually pixels that creates enough room to display a shadow

17891108
knitr	latex
i am just an average joe that want to learn some r and hopefully be able to report in lyx knitr therefore i don t understand much latex or coding in general

17891119
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but in ie 10 the only thing that shows up is the text not found

17891165
qevent	qwidget
the solution is to overide qwidget event qevent event

17891199
stdout	stderr
hide stdout and stderr

17891199
stdout	stderr
write stdout and stderr

17891199
stdout	stderr
in my script only stdout and stderr is missing

17891199
stdout	stderr
i could probably redirect stdout stderr to a temporary file and use cat to show it in case an error was bash trapped

17891212
put	get
when i put the libraries in separate files in the server directory i also tried placing them in the lib directory i get the error referenceerror cryptojs is not defined

17891222
portrait	landscape
this is either landscape or portrait meaning that the

17891270
textarea	textbox
conversely textarea does have the ability to have child html that s how rich textbox are implemented in html and needs a closing tag

17891317
scrypt	pbkdf2
in general using either bcrypt pbkdf2 or scrypt on the server to provide a good layer of security

17891321
margin	height
you ll probably want to add a margin to the bottom of #main that is the same height as your fixed footer

17891341
fadein	fadeout
instead of trying to force this animation on those old browser you could gracefully degrade to some other more simple effect a simple fadeout fadein

17891351
repo	egit
i am using eclipse 3.8 for linux with egit and am trying to import my java git repo from github

17891384
tolower	toupper
create a duplicate field using tolower or toupper which again is not the ideal solution in my case as my dataset is huge

17891426
fadein	fadeout
all that it involves is calling the jquery fadein fadeout functions on some element after the tap event

17891429
put	get
make the outer class extend listfragment and put all your list code there and get rid of the inner class

17891433
google-chrome	firefox
when the aforementioned image is being loaded however the browser displays the loading icon on firefox and google-chrome this is in the icon on the tab

17891434
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval executes the code after the time specified and settimeout executes the code every time it reaches the specific time

17891434
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval and settimeout

17891434
setinterval	settimeout
javascript setinterval and settimeout

17891451
listview	gridview
but none of the existing adapters listview gridview really fit what i am trying to do here

17891461
portrait	landscape
this is either landscape or portrait meaning that the screen s aspect ratio is either wide or tall respectively

17891466
portrait	landscape
what i ve done in the past for situations like this is to create separate viewcontrollers for landscape and portrait for instances i don t want the view to auto-rotate

17891541
client-side	server-side
you are mixing server-side and client-side code

17891561
hide	show
then you can simply hide or show leftwidget or rightwidget to effectively control the visibility of everything in the vertical layouts that you have without having to hide show each individual widget

17891577
opera	safari
i m having a problem playing audio in safari or opera

17891582
width	height
width 100 height 200 and this php page s content-type is image jpg

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works fine on win7 + firefox opera google-chrome safari but on mac it tries to download file.rar.html or file.zip.html instead of file.rar file.zip

17891698
ubuntu	linux
i have a retired pc 10 year old installed with ubuntu linux i am not sure what graphics card it has must be some old one

17891764
inherited	properties
the ship structure class does not have a navigation properties to ownablespaceobject because it then crate one huge table for all of my fleets asteroids planets because they all inherited from ownablespaceobject

17891768
children	parent
if your table represents id_1 is a parent of id_2 then both a parent can have many children and children can have more than one parent this is known as a many-to-many relationship

17891774
hash	md5
i am aware and know how to create a login with a database which has md5 hash and store cookies to stop un-authorised people accessing my ftp

17891779
pull	push
should i pull the github repo inside a new folder and then revert it and then push it back to github

17891821
versioning	upgrade
the problem is that the versioning of numpy installed on the dotcloud python service is too old so you need to add the following to your requirements.txt file before scipy to upgrade to a newer versioning

17891864
minimum	max
for example if your seekbar is only 500 pixels wide and the max is 2000 the absolute minimum value change you can get is

17891864
minimum	max
so assuming an average touch slop of 8 even with a rather large seekbar of 1200 pixels and your original max of 2000 you should get a minimum value change of

17891877
ubuntu	debian
but i don t think pytables works with python3 yet at least there is no debian ubuntu package for python3 yet

17891901
ubuntu	linux
the node.js installed with linux is probably installed in usr sbin at least it was for me on ubuntu 13.04

17891916
int	chars
if they really look the same but aren t equal loop through their chars and print their int values

17891948
inherited	properties
all properties of customobject will be inherited by the instances of customobject2 through the prototype chain

17891992
mouseover	mouseout
it only starts to goof when the mouseover and mouseout are in the code

17891999
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
what you want to do then is to position it absolutely 50 off the top and left of your screen and with a margin of half its height width

17891999
width	height
note that you could also use percentages for the height and width on the surrounding but for the percentage-based height to work the s parent element s height must be set known

17892023
uilabel	nsstring
uilabel by measuring the text with nsstring sizewithfont and positioning and sizing the label would also go with uitextfield considering the padding

17892046
filesystems	hfs
the hfs filesystems uses decomposed characters in the filenames so ã is stored as two unicode characters

17892058
width	height
first you need a container that will always have some width and height

17892067
int	double
use double to hold your x y pointx pointy etc and cast to int when drawing

17892089
for-loop	arrays
i d like to create a polygon from coordinates of both arrays by iterating through them as you see with the for-loop

17892094
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to eclipse kepler the non-j2ee versioning

17892139
width	height
so you need to subtract off half of the width from the margin-left and half of the height from the margin-top

17892177
calloc	malloc
i d also recommending removing all the casts on malloc and calloc return values

17892218
put	get
however when i try creating an index with a put i get back the error

17892221
pyquery	beautifulsoup
instead i would take a look at a python html parsing package like beautifulsoup or pyquery

17892241
width	height
for some flipping reason i can t control the height of width of my image

17892253
for-loop	arrays
i fill the arrays with a simple for-loop but for some reason this is producing unexpected results

17892270
post	get
i m able to like and unlike post just fine using the same code obviously with a comment id instead of the post id i m able to like the comment it works fine but when i try to unlike the comment i get back networkerror 500 ok - and the content is a json object with the properties of

17892338
post	put
i can easily debug continent post and put methods

17892360
getter	setter
i have an abstract class aunit with variables and getter setter in virtual pure like this

17892360
getter	setter
in their .cpp i write the code of the getter and setter

17892404
crypt	salt
i ve used php s crypt function with the blowfish algorithm but it takes two parameters the string to encode and a salt

17892450
namedtuple	dictionary
if the keys are from a small fixed set you re better off using namedtuple in dictionary with unique key for each object

17892478
queue	fifo
using slice 0 allows you to use an array like a fifo queue

17892485
public	protected
this way functionality can be added and the common logic can be used of course any virtual function is not public but rather private or protected

17892508
put	get
so i took the code from the mongo db cookbook for date range and put it into a simple node.js application to see if i could get that to work with no success

17892508
put	get
when i don t pass date filters i get the results but when i put in the date filters i don t get results back

17892526
superclass	subclassing
initialize the subclassing by passing a perimeter of the superclass object

17892526
superclass	subclassing
to me it reeks of smelly code but i don t see another way of passing all the data fields of a superclass object to an initialization of a subclassing without knowing every data field in the superclass

17892531
hide	show
to just hide or just show you can use

17892534
listadapter	convertview
so the case you describe happens because the listadapter reuses the convertview that was inflated for every object so if the last object for your listview has setvisibility view.gone for your second line then when you scroll up all the other childs that become visible will also have visibility view.gone

17892642
subtract	add
this i have found is the perfect approach because if you add or subtract data members to your class the save load is not dependent on the binary representation and order of your save as your class will doubtless evolve through time if you save sequentially this is a problem you will face

17892672
oncreate	setcontentview
dude call all your view initializations in oncreate after call to setcontentview

17892687
oncreate	setcontentview
are outside of any method so they would get called before anything else particularly oncreate where you call setcontentview which would make them null

17892687
oncreate	setcontentview
a more conventional way and more readable way would be to declare them as member variables then initialize them in oncreate or in an initialization method if you choose after the all to setcontentview

17892701
put	get	post	get	post	put
in type you need put get or post

17892744
oncreate	setcontentview
1 your findviews should go in the oncreate after your setcontentview

17892754
ostream	ostringstream
can it be any kind of ostream or can you constrain the type to ofstream or ostringstream

17892769
std	ostream
you can use this in place of the std ostream you already have

17892769
ostringstream	std
others are likely to suggest the use of std ostringstream

17892770
int	double
for example if a is int and b is int then return if one or both of them are double then return

17892777
sorting	filtering
rather than actually sorting i just filtering the daysofweek array based on the contents of the input array

17892782
libxml2	libxslt
you need to upgrade libxml2 and libxslt

17892794
stdout	fflush
if the prompt doesn t appear you can add a fflush stdout

17892805
children	parent
using anchorpane one can force the children nodes to take the space relative to the parent

17892806
g++	gcc
this is a linker option and must be passed from gcc or g++ to the linker so the -wl option has to be used

17892817
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work fine and when i examine the network waterfalls in google-chrome developer tools as well as on webpagetest.org running google-chrome firefox and ie the stylesheets indeed load in parallel

17892851
keydown	keyup
keydown keypress keyup

17892870
int	boolean
public boolean find int start

17892922
implements	extends
if classa indeed implements extends someinterface one or the other you used different terms then pass classa.class

17892931
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ are capable of compiling c++ code with various optimizations

17892931
g++	gcc
gcc g++ can also output assembly instructions

17892931
g++	gcc
often gcc g++ code is faster than anything i can produce in asm probably because i am new to assembler and so i don t know very many instructions

17892962
google-chrome	firefox
the only hit that i ve received after working on this for hours is from the firefox and google-chrome web consoles which like to the line

17892988
min	max
the interesting thing is that both max and min can be used this way

17892988
min	max
further min and max allow passing a key argument to turn each candidate in the iterable into a value suitable for a binary comparison

17893012
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

17893043
rss	feed
i m getting rss feed from a facebook page in my android app

17893043
rss	feed
however this rss feed returns me some html tags when it has images for instance

17893046
fadein	hide
i have chained a hide and a fadein to animate the append

17893133
width	height
the php file performs some simple arithmetic to constrain by width or height checks if the resized version is already in cache if so outputs it if not resizes the images saves it using imagejpeg and outputs it with header content-type image jpeg

17893181
for-loop	arrays
the first iteration of the for-loop causes undefined behavior in your program because the product arrays is uninitialized

17893309
width	height
it loads each file correctly reports the width and height of each image correctly

17893328
width	height
the value i get from desktop height and width is the sum of the two monitor resolution

17893370
pandas	pytables
i am trying to ptrepack a hdf file that was created with pandas hdfstore pytables interface

17893436
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i m trying to use a for-loop which loops through two arrays

17893436
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
my goal is to use a for-loop to automatically loops through both arrays at the same time and for example set

17893465
bsearch	strcmp	qsort	bsearch	qsort	strcmp
qsort bsearch and strcmp provide an easy relatively efficient sort search mechanism for anything that starts with a string eg

17893472
uiview	subviews
i am adding second uiview as a subviews to 1st view when a button is pressed

17893527
google-chrome	firefox
you must reset css because google-chrome and firefox have default margins and paddings for tags

17893541
multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	addition	subtraction	addition
in hardware as well as software where hardware multiplying instruction is not available it is usually implemented in cordic since this requires only addition subtraction bitshift and table lookup

17893551
onresume	onpause
typically a receiver or scheduled runnable will register in onresume and unregister in onpause for better lifecycle pairing

17893558
stdout	stderr
this will require some tweaking to get it to be robust short program names program names with spaces in them ... and more friendly stdout for 4 and stderr for 3 .

17893579
ecdsa	aes
unfortunately because all of the aes galois counter mode suites were also ecdsa this rules those out for the time being

17893598
folder	directory
the directory to be added to the zip file will also include other folder as well and there will be duplicates in the zip file that will need to be overwritten

17893620
hide	show
hide and show the dialog

17893628
google-chrome	firefox
when viewing in google-chrome everything looks fine but firefox is a different story

17893663
inherited	properties
for example when inheriting properties from the prototype no properties will be inherited until the base constructor is called

17893667
put	get
it might be easier just to call the zip command instead but put these together and you should be able to get to where you want

17893714
folder	dir
if dir the folder

17893737
post	get
at the very least i d rather someone improperly use post requests for everything - but not get

17893752
inherited	properties
this condition is in place because objects have many more properties especially from inherited

17893753
des	aes
you could encrypt the first time with an insecure algorithm such as des and encrypt a second time with a much better algorithm such as aes

17893773
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been struggling to adjust a block on my website to be the same on firefox as it is on google-chrome and ie

17893773
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see on google-chrome and ie its fine but on firefox its all hanging down like a saggy old lady

17893798
pop-up	dialog
when a certain list item is selected the numberpicker dialog then pop-up using this code

17893907
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is when a user clicks the link the video is shown in firefox but does not work in google-chrome

17893935
hash	md5
so md5 generates hash of size evp_max_md_size 16 + 20 16 for md5

17893996
post	get
the number of post seem to get it from posts_per_page with the default number of post set in wordpress

17894110
post	get
and well it works fine send and receive post data with json format my problem is that when i try to save the form in a different html and then retrieve it through a button or something my call is done with get params and i have no idea why

17894110
post	get
i have read the .load from jquery doc also many post from this site but i don t seem to find any information i also want to mention that i know .load is by default get i send some parameters to make it post this is how i get the form from an external archive

17894185
spaces	delimiter
separated by places a delimiter usually spaces sometimes comma or semicolon between the results in the macro variable

17894240
versioning	upgrade
i can t run my downgrade script because alembic never updated the versioning since it didn t complete the upgrade

17894282
minimum	max	min	max
just to make sure set the last two parameters to 0 min max radius and try to lower the minimum distance between centers

17894303
swt	swing
unless your program happens to use swt instead of swing or happens to have some other 32 64-bit dependency

17894330
hide	show
ios scrollbars for a uiscrollview usually hide after a brief delay but i want to the scrollbars in my app to show all the time like in this picture

17894355
inherited	properties
but i want to know why some css properties get inherited and others not

17894431
post	put
i was working on this rails tutorial and than i got to the part that you are supposed to show the title and data for an individual post 5.7 and got an error when it was supposed to show the data so i put post.inspect into app views post show.html.erb and i got nil and same with the index page where it lists all of the post but i checked and the data is in the database correctly

17894455
g++	gcc
many c++ compilers like the gcc document said but not gcc g++ produce c code output

17894488
ssl	https
for the users login with https you have to enable the ssl and use a code which fit your case to use it

17894545
children	parent
this is because a statement like saves the parent record and the children when record of user is new

for example check1.settag position then you should implement both oncheckboxchangelistener for your checkbox and onclicklistener for your delete button

17896503
post	get
because when we set condition we filter post by category and we can t get all categories

17896503
post	get

17897487
addition	multiplication
i wrote this function to underline the fact that no matter which convention you use the resulting of the vector matrix multiplication is just a multiplication and an addition between the vector s input coordinates and the coordinate system s axis coordinates ax ay and az regardless of the notation you use and regardless of the way you store them in memory

17897545
width	height
hi friends is there any possible to get a double color background like this as 100 width and height like this

17897560
rss	feed
i have an string in this format which i fetched from an rss feed

asterisk	freeswitch
comparing to asterisk i would advise to start every greenfield project with freeswitch and use asterisk only if there s already a working system and trained personnel

17897974
udp	tcp
in your case i think a better approach would be to use tcp instead of udp

17897977
cout	cin
i think you re confused between cout and cin

17897977
cout	cin
writing cin after cout and not giving it any input wouldn t take the value john

17897978
fadein	fadeout
i m working on a site that uses fadein and fadeout all the time as transitions between different sections

17897978
fadein	fadeout
the problem is that everytime i change the section i m viewing - therefor using fadeout and fadein - the plugin s jquery code stops working or works erratically

17897990
cout	cin
when you use cout it outputs something and when you use cin it is an input operator

17898001
hide	show
the new keyword should be used to explicitly show that you know you are hiding the method however your code will still compile and hide the method

17898097
opera	google-chrome
it doesn t work on google-chrome opera and ie though

17898169
ssl	https
using .htaccess i m looking to remove https and make it https on all subdomains because it s returning a browser error as i don t have an ssl certificate for the subodomains

17898203
int	double
most likely a double is eight bytes on your platform while an int is only four

17898203
int	double
so the printf function could be treating the first four bytes of your double value as an int

17898203
int	double
what is perhaps even worse is that on the next line an int is being passed where a double is expected

17898203
int	double
which means that the printf function could treat the first four bytes of your int as part of the double and then read four more bytes that weren t even part of your arguments

17898217
integer	unsigned
corresponding unsigned integer type and the value is representable

17898222
int	chars
like a chars is casted to an int

it works just fin under google-chrome and firefox but almost dies on safari

17898229
squeel	ransack
give a try to squeel and ransack gem

17898354
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
what you can do is to allocate the structure in the heap via malloc calloc and then you can free that memory area via the free function

17898364
floating-point	integer
in all cases the result is an integer that when given to the intbitstofloat int method will produce a floating-point value the same as the argument to floattointbits except all nan values are collapsed to a single canonical nan value

17898369
free	malloc
malloc returns null if there s no more free memory and the code checks that

17898381
rss	feed
i would to get rss feed on my application so i pot this url in my code in order to get the xml file then making parsing ..

17898381
rss	feed
rss feed

17898429
udp	tcp
tcp also improved but not as much as udp

17898436
getter	setter
to enforce this try to avoid using synthesize at all which is only needed if you provide both custom getter and setter but not one or the other

17898436
getter	setter
the compiler automatically allows you to use _propertyname in the getter setter which is necessary to prevent recursive calls of the function

17898447
post	get
and then you can get a post and filter votes with something like

17898458
int	chars
you should also be careful because getchar actually returns an int and not a chars

17898468
fgets	getchar
you may want to use fgets instead of relying on character input and ignoring newlines with 2 getchar calls everytime

17898483
wordpress	joomla
your site uses neither wordpress nor joomla or this multilanguage plugin changes default login url

17898506
gif	png
i m trying to convert a pdf to an image file png jpg gif does not matter

getter	setter
in the interested classes override the non- static method returning the value of a private static class getvalueprovider implementing setter and getter for the wanted value

17898540
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

17898550
button	checkbox
also if you like it you could change the appearance of the checkbox changing the property appearance from normal to button

17898550
button	checkbox
now you have a checkbox with the same ui design of a button

17898550
button	checkbox
when you click on that button you could change the text of the checkbox to yes no based on the checked value

17898579
width	height
but all that divs are 100 width and height even when the user change the size of the window

17898604
post	get
in your post action if you want to retrieve the collection all you have to do is exactly the same you did in your get action to retrieve it in the first place

17898626
zoo	xts
it s also easier to use read.zoo instead of read.csv because merging time-series is a lot easier with xts zoo objects

17898703
unsigned	short
i was initializing array unsigned short int of size 100000000 in c 4.3.2 and other two int array of size 1000000

17898708
joptionpane	jdialog
you can create a jdialog out of a joptionpane and then display the dialog any location that you desire

17898722
memset	malloc
or you can also use memset explicitly to initialize memory allocated by malloc call

17898749
for-loop	loops
i have loops statement with cursor and fetch and that works but i wanna for-loop

17898767
hide	scrolltop	hide	show
i tried using jquery functions like slidedown hide show scrolltop scrollleft

17898780
width	height
instead try setting the width and height to titanium.ui.size titanium.ui.fill a pixel value or a percentage of the parent view

17898841
width	height
just remember to give html and body a width and height property

17898850
stdout	stderr
its doing something weird to write text to the console to where powershell and cmd can t capture it through the stdout stderr streams

17898850
stdout	stderr
i m guessing instead of using the stdout stderr api it may be manipulating characters on the console directly or something

17898850
stdout	stderr
i tried redirecting stderr to stdout but that didn t work either

17898862
qstring	qobject
qstring not inherits from qobject but could be used in signal slot system without registration

17898885
bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
given images may be in any format like jpg png bmp tiff

17898956
neo4j	datomic
both neo4j and datomic can model arbitrary relationships

17898956
neo4j	datomic
both neo4j and datomic provide traversal apis and query languages

17898956
neo4j	datomic
both neo4j and datomic provide declarative query languages cypher and datalog respectively that support recursive queries except datomic s datalog provides far superior querying capabilities by allowing custom filtering and aggregate functions to be implemented as arbitrary jvm code

17898956
neo4j	datomic
traversal apis are always driven by application code which means both neo4j and datomic are able to walk a graph using arbitrary traversal filtering and data transformation code except neo4j requires a running transaction which in practice means it s time-bounded

17898956
neo4j	datomic
both neo4j and datomic are transactional acid systems but because neo4j uses traditional interactive transactions -using optimistic concurrency controls- queries need to happen inside transactions need to be coordinated which imposes timeout constraints to your queries

17899000
hide	show	ng-show	ng-hide
i m aware of ng-hide and ng-show and i could do a simple true false statement in the template to show or hide the imgs smallimgs

mvp	presenter
your view console wpf web has dependency on a layer in between view and model either a presenter mvp controller mvc or viewmodel mvvm

folder	directory
i am trying to create a batch file or other script to take the contents of one folder to a folder containing its name in another directory

17899201
int	chars
forgive me if there is any confusion the above methods are only for converting from chars to int and int to chars

17899201
int	chars
going back to the original string is a little trickier but that does not seem to be what you are asking nonetheless if you know that an int cooresponds to a chars that was converted you can use inttocharcustomconversion

17899234
dlsym	dlopen
one way to call functions from other native libraries aside from java reflection on their corresponding java class is to load the library from c c++ and wrap its functions via dlopen dlsym etc.

17899237
inherited	properties
im using a own class rect because i need some extra properties which i removed from the shown code and i cant inherited from rectangle

17899304
loops	if-statement
means that the array contains all name oxtitles even outside the while loops so that i can work with if-statement

17899305
folder	directory
as you already retrieve the directoryinfo for the folder being moved you can use its name property to get the name of the directory you are moving which you can then append to the destination path

17899335
children	parent
i have a html form where i want to check all children after clicking on parent

17899373
width	height
in the oncreateview of my fragment class i am creating and returning a view whose contents need to be dynamically created based on the actual screen width and height of the fragment

17899373
width	height
it would be most ideal if i were able to determine the width and height within oncreateview

17899373
width	height	children	parent
this is because when the view is constructed within oncreateview many child view s are added to it and how the parent layout view organises those children into columns depending on available width and height to create a kind of fluid column container

17899373
width	height	layoutparams	viewgroup
i tried seeing what layoutparams are contained in the viewgroup passed to oncreateview but the width and height seem to be constants as opposed to specific widths and height

17899373
width	height
if that is the case then what i suspect i need to do is build my container view in two phases 1 add the children to it initially and then 2 actually organise those child view s into columns within an override of a method that s called at a point when the width and height are known

17899381
implicit	shapeless
but we can fix that with some implicit evidence provided by the new support for tuples in shapeless 2.0.0-snapshot

17899392
uiview	subviews
i am trying to create a uiview as a subviews of a subclassed uitableviewcell

17899433

if i put back the model functions code back to the controller everything will work but i will get a code duplication in all my controller actions

17899469
disk	ram
make sure you have enough ram so that your data set fits with ram atleast your index should fit inside the ram coz each time a data fetched from disk is 10 times slower than ram

17899517
hash	md5
i include the last one because you will see people use hash functions for other reasons like to guarantee the output is 16bytes 128bits for md5

17899539
hash	md5
for what you re trying to achieve preventing a 3rd party from determining your user identifier a straight md5 or sha1 hash is insufficient

17899558
mediarecorder	audiorecord
i m trying to record sound into an array short or bytes using audiorecord mediarecorder worked like a charm but it only records to files and not to arrays

17899600
youtube	vimeo
for large media files like video and music you should host the files yourself or using a service like vimeo or youtube

17899610
filewriter	bufferedwriter
filewriter is not buffered you have to use a bufferedwriter as a wrapper

17899611

17899641
integer	unsigned
the other integer literals are unsigned or signed

17899641
integer	unsigned
the signed result is converted to unsigned through the rules of c integer conversion

17899655
toolbar	tabs
you could either create a custom tab on the ribbon using xml you seem to be familiar with that or create a floating toolbar that lives at the bottom of the sheet - close to where the old tabs used to be

17899703

devise	bcrypt-ruby
i get a missing bcrypt-ruby a dependency of devise error when i try to start the rails server or input db commands

17899777
devise	bcrypt-ruby
how can i force devise to use the newer version of bcrypt-ruby that is in the gemfile 3.1.1 and not the auto installed dependency 3.0.1 because adding bcrypt-ruby 3.1.1 to gemfile and running bundle update install does does not seem to solve the problem

17899793
post	put
while i put link_to post user_posts user_post is showing in rake routes in any users view file rails says undefined local variable or method user_posts

17899804
udp	tcp
in order to overcome this issue you need to break the nat using tcp udp hole punching

17899823
16-bit	64bit
the 16-bit real mode assembly code you write and put in that rom can then change the processor mode to 32-bit and 64bit mode as you d like

17899874
udp	tcp
according to the following article udp hole punching supports 82 and tcp hole punching only support 64

17899889
gif	png
yes the prettygifs plugin offers excellent octree quantization for both png and gif images

17899889
gif	png
hand-optimizing png gif css sprites and site-wide icons is usually going to give you a smaller file size that imageresizer can although it s nearly impossible to beat for photographic data

17899900
width	height
if you re doing this in an app with auto layout turned on which it is by default then i would not use a transform but just resize the width and height of the image view by adjusting its height and width constraints

17899900
width	height
so in this method you should make iboutlets to height and width constraints you make in ib then change their constant values in an animation block

17900001
setcontentview	findviewbyid
4 - before call findviewbyid with any view in hombre or mujer call setcontentview with the corresponding layout hombre or mujer

17900029

17900236
listener	eventhandler
the eventhandler class provides support for dynamically generating event listener whose methods execute a simple statement involving an incoming event object and a target object

17900236
listener	eventhandler
the reason that listener created with eventhandler have such a small footprint is that the proxy class on which the eventhandler relies shares implementations of identical interfaces

17900236
listener	eventhandler
for example if you use the eventhandler create methods to make all the actionlisteners in an application all the action listener will be instances of a single class one created by the proxy class

17900236
listener	eventhandler
instead you use one of the eventhandler create methods to create an object that implements a given listener interface

17900236
listener	eventhandler
this listener object uses an eventhandler object behind the scenes to encapsulate information about the event the object to be sent a message when the event occurs the message method to be sent and any argument to the method

17900237
listener	eventhandler
the eventhandler class provides support for dynamically generating event listener whose methods execute a simple statement involving an incoming event object and a target object

this would have worked at least in firefox and google-chrome

17900610
implements	extends
in my case i want to do this with image - but that doesn t seem to be possible when i add extends image i have to implements required methods and that means i have to program a new image class

17900638
implements	extends
if you extends a non-abstract class the methods are implements therefore you may choose to override them as long as they re not final - or the class itself is not final

17900674
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml

17900730
implements	extends
you could extends arraylist and only implements what you wanted to add

17900730
implements	extends
you would have to implements more to extends abstractlist

17900734
min	max
these convex hulls can be turned into rectangles by finding the min and max x an y coordinates of their vertices

17900762
implements	extends
so if you extends it you would have to implements all of its abstract methods which is like reinventing the whole wheel

17900762
implements	extends
however you can extends the class which already implements the image class and has all the methods already implements in it

17900763
tostring	string.format
or for the whole block using direct tostring formatting instead of using string.format

17900790

switching	screens
i did discover at the bottom of the screens there are tabs to switching between code design and history which does at least give a mouse-based workaround to toggling between the views without having to expand the file view and click the right pas dfm file

17901161
post	get
i ll post back here when i get around to implementing it

17901404
public	protected
a key thing to understand with protected members is that the reason a toyotacar should not alter the semantics of public members of car is that a reference to a toyotacar might be given to code which is expecting a car rather than a toyotacar

17901404
public	protected
on the other hand if toyotacar alters the behavior of a protected method of car in a fashion which isn t exposed by any public members the only code which could notice such alteration is code which is within either toyotacar or a derivative thereof and such code is going to know that it has a toyotacar

there is also a folder with dependencies included in the top level polled mks project directory

17901572
g++	gcc
i m not real experienced when it comes to modifying a build process other than setting include paths libraries etc. especially when an ide like eclipse is driving it but my assumption is that the compiler and linker gcc g++ isn t configured for c++11 though i ve tried various recommendations from so and the eclipse forums like adding -std c++11 but i just keep seeing output saying that they re unrecognized arguments

17901846
width	height
in fragment s oncreateview width and height are not available yet both are 0

17901846

without custom view you can use viewtreeobserver in fragment to determine when width and height are calculated then calculate size for child views and add them

17901846
width	height
in ondraw method is width and height already calculated

17901866
lisp	smalltalk
obviously none of this is quite what you re looking for but python unlike smalltalk or lisp isn t necessarily programmed in itself and guarantees to expose its own underlying execution and parsing mechanisms at runtime

17901868
libstdc++	libc++
the above links to libc++ which is the preferred c++ standard library for mac os x with clang and a lot more complete than libstdc++ even when considering the newest gcc

17901868
g++	gcc
as for the reason why this happens my magic fortune telling ball tells me the g++ you are calling is an ancient gcc 4.2.1 apple thingie with that gcc s libstdc++ which has little to no c++11 support

17901869
keydown	keyup
so you can make an action the first time the keydown event is handled and not doing it again until the keyup event was fired

17902762
strcpy	strcmp
there s a quick way to get the answer without tracing all the calls both arguments to the strcat are returned from strcpy s with the first arg str3 and since strcpy returns its first arg that means the final call is strcmp str3 str3 which of course will be 0 no matter what weird manipulations have been done on it

i ve just built a structure for this sort of thing - i generate a heap structure min or max doesn t matter

17903061
getter	setter
auto-generated getter and setter do not really improve the code or anything

17903061
getter	setter
the generated properties are probably made public - you are free to change them when you add logic to the getter or setter

17903063

sequence	permutation
we know that every swap leaves the scoring function unchanged and a permutation is just a sequence of swaps so every permutation also leaves the scoring function unchanged

17903286
sequence	permutation
as before it s easy to see that any permutation of these central elements corresponds to a sequence of swaps and that any such swap will leave the overall score unchanged in fact it s even simpler than before since swapping two central elements does not even change the score contribution of either of these elements

17903328
min	max
the last link shows a way to calculate the min and max value should be nearly the same in java

17903359

17903419
implements	extends
on a side note if you ever were to implements your own tablemodel extends abstracttablemodel when the memory structure created and handled by yourself that contains the table data changes you have to update the table with the new values or new column rows changes using an assortment of methods in the abstracttablemodel class to notify the jtable firetabledatachanged firerowsinserted firetablestructurechanged .

17903466
ienumerable	iqueryable
resharper is indicating that the method might as well be defined to return ienumerable even if all implementations return iqueryable if a call needed an iqueryable instead of an ienumerable they can just call asqueryable too msdn

17903513
int	boolean
in systems like android it often makes sense to compress many different boolean properties into a single int value

17903514
integer	fractions
this is because numbers of different magnitudes generally have different numbers of bits available for the fractions part because some of the bits are used for the integer part

17903516
setinterval	settimeout
either way use requestanimationframe in browsers that support it instead of settimeout or setinterval

17903555
apk	dex
i m 90 sure they get the pathclassloader that you re given getsystemclassloader get the dexpathlist and override the dexelements private field to have an extra element with the other dex file apk in your case

17903555

portrait	landscape
so in the end you have one fragment for orientation landscape and one for portrait

the problem is that jquery uses multithreading for commands which affect the graphic display so your fadein and fadeout calls are being run in the background in their own thread while the main execution thread carries on to the next instruction immediately

17909208
fadein	fadeout
what you need is the callback feature of commands like fadein and fadeout

17909208

however if the file contains spaces instead of newlines as delimiter

17917816
post	get
to get the post id use get_the_id

17917816
post	get
second if you are outside the loop then neither simply the_id nor get_the_id is going to work you have to provide the post id manually or by receiving it using get or post method

17917837
google-chrome	firefox
in fact i have tested and reproduced this issue on firefox 20 and control-tested on google-chrome 28 by manipulating this fiddle removing and re-adding the argument

17917852
post	get
request.post.get will work anyway post is always initialized as a querydict and the get returns none if the key is not found so you won t get any errors - and it might be easier for you to see what s going on.ï

17917899
crossover	mutation
do you want to use mutation crossover or both

i would like to explode a string separated based on a delimiter and placed into an array using both a spaces and a newline n as a delimiter

17918387
innodb	myisam
difference between innodb and myisam

17918387
innodb	myisam
first major difference i see is that innodb implements row-level lock while myisam can do only a table-level lock

17918387
innodb	myisam
innodb also implements transactions foreign keys and relationship constraints while myisam does not

17918387
innodb	myisam
innodb has row-level locking myisam can only do full table-level locking

17918387
innodb	myisam
myisam has fulltext search indexes innodb doesn t

17918387
innodb	myisam
innodb implements transactions foreign keys and relationship constraints myisam does not

17918392
cos	sin
because sin pi sin -pi and cos pi cos -pi cgaffinetransformmakerotation m_pi equals cgaffinetransformmakerotation -m_pi

17918407
folder	directory
the correct location for these settings is in the packages folder for your installation which can be opened using inside the theme - default directory in a file named default.sublime-theme

17918435
post	get
the getjson as the name say will send get request if you want to use json-rpc you need to use post like

17918511
getter	setter
and create variables inside that and also write setter and getter method for that variable in singleton class

17918543
rss	feed
just came to know that sax parser don t fetch tags like content encoded from rss feed

17918562
maven	pom.xml
point your pom.xml file to the maven repository

17918568

if i understand correctly when deleting a parent you want to delete all it s children so that they are not orphaned

17918671
width	height
ui elements in windows phone 7 have a maximum renderable height and width of 2048 pixels

17918686
int	double
i need to put in values like 30.0 27 54.002 and they need to be double s and int s

inherited	properties
you may bind the text properties in both textboxes to a properties of the same viewmodel object which is set to the datacontext of mainwindow and inherited to the usercontrols

17918827
hide	show
implement an event handler for the loadcompleted event on the webbrowser and when it is triggered swap the visibility states to hide the progress wait message and show the web browser

17918875

hi i m new to javascript and i would like you to help me figure out why i can t get the result of the random number generator to appear in the span tag after the user clicks a calculate button using the min and max number they entered

17919069
superclass	subclassing
by doing that you can have common code in superclass and just implement the differences in the subclassing

17919089

my goal is to reduce the size of image width and height

17919128
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
collectionviewsource is a layer between ui and actual collection which provides some additional control over how the collection is displayed sorting filtering grouping etc.

17919157
instances	transient
that class might simply be registeres as transient and because you resolve it at each pulse of the timer each thread gets its own instances or the lifetime is scoped in that case the class lifetime will probably end when the timed operation ends

17919169
gridview	sqldatasource
since you are using sqldatasource as the datasourceid for your gridview this sqldatasource control will take care of delete functionality

17919169
gridview	sqldatasource
this is because when we click delete button the gridview will accordingly pass on this to sqldatasource with correct parameters

17919169
gridview	sqldatasource
with datasourceid as sqldatasource control you need to set the delete command of this datasource control.when we click delete button the gridview will accordingly pass on this to sqldatasource with correct parameters

17919193
mediarecorder	audiorecord
if you are processing the audio data then use audiorecord class instead of mediarecorder class

17919215
profiler	yourkit
i am new to yourkit profiler and after reading some good reviews wanted to give it a try

17919271
folder	directory
i need to save a uploaded file in sub directory of document media folder in liferay from web-form portlet

17919276
dbcontext	objectcontext
it seems that now dbcontext is supported so no objectcontext generators nor casting will be needed to use telerik reporting with ef 5 and probably ef 6 beta though i haven t tested it yet

17919358
width	height
if you just want to edit width and height without any complications and changing the actual size

17919358
width	height
just put height and width values accordingly

17919390
sudo	passwd
and it works fine that i could run commands with sudo but without asking passwd

17919440
inotifycollectionchanged	icollectionview	filtering	grouping
icollectionview will give you the ability to filtering sort or grouping the collection along with propagating inotifycollectionchanged events if the underlying collection implements it

17919486
ubuntu	linux
i would like to know one thing about linux ubuntu permission commands

17919487

i have the below function which loads a url into my dialog when that url is opened a function is run on document ready that function show or hide divs depending on a value

17919487
hide	show
url document ready show hide divs

17919506
public	protected
using a struct we can achieve all the functionality of a class constructors that can be modified overloaded destructors that can be modified overloaded operator overloading instance methods static methods public private protected fields methods

17919539
folder	directory
you can clone it into a vendor directory and then symlink it s app folder into your project but i d recommend against that

17919557
prepare	execute
since watchexpression can execute multiple times per digest cycle when a change is detected be prepare for multiple calls to your listener.

17919560
build.gradle	gradlew
build.gradle excerpt gradlew task and dependencies

17919605
post	get
i have been doing some research and all i find are redirect with the post method but nothing really explained with get

17919656
portrait	landscape
there are some pages when i m changing from portrait to landscape and then from landscape to portrait the page takes only half of the webview

17919683
box-sizing	border-box
another simple solution would be to set box-sizing border-box

17919712
public	protected
note you should make your base classes explicitly public private or protected rather than relying on the defaults

17919751
post	get
there is a js library that i have built that has a few functions which do ajax post and get requests

17919816
ubuntu	centos
on ubuntu centos 6 systems you can use upstart which has a great deal of advantages compared to the old sysvinit aggressive parallelisation respawning simple init config syntax etc

17919816
daemons	systemd
this way you offload process management from your provisioner to the systemd upstart daemons

17919864
put	get	post	get	post	put
so this appears to have made the first form a post and the second one a get but has put the second form inside of the first one

17919881
inherited	properties
i have inherited the propertydescriptor class to provide kind of dynamic properties

17919898
children	parent
the parent class has the protected method setchildactionmethod callable by the children

17919898
children	parent
when the children are instantiated they tell the parent the name of the method they would like it to call on save

17919966
google-chrome	firefox
or in firefox and google-chrome

17919980
hide	show
i also need an â addâ button which then hide the table and show the input fields to enter the values for the new mastertype

17920021
filtering	grouping
do all the filtering grouping sorts etc

17920061
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
what i ve done works in safari and google-chrome but for some reason it doesn t work in firefox the scrollable div in the cell on the right doesn t scroll but instead pushes the table bigger.

17920064
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have this uinavigationcontroller whose root view controller contains a uitableview which pushes a uiviewcontroller open cell selection

17920138
children	parent
however at your case you got 5 forms open parent + 4 children

17920138
children	parent
thus i would suggest you write the handler in the parent form but register all children s keypress event to it some pseudocode

17920157
getter	setter
what s even more confusing is that i ve verified that i m on the same thread thread 3 when the getter is accessed and when the setter raises the propertychanged event - regardless of the code version

17920293
hash	md5
try do_hash permits you to create sha1 or md5 one way hash suitable for encrypting passwords

17920319
folder	directory
try to copy the .shh folder into your jenkins home directory

17920345
google-chrome	firefox
both methods works great in firefox and ie10 not with google-chrome but that doesn t work in ie9 it simply ignores the css directives

17920394
ienumerable	iqueryable
i m looking to get a better understanding on when we should look to use ienumerable over iqueryable with linq to entities

17920419
put	get
note some user also put security to do not share email address to any other then also it might be case that you will not get email address

17920432
getter	setter
and the getter and setter

17920468
width	height
my problem is that when i use percentage values in height and width css values on all img tags they scale properly but their aspect ratio remains static resulting in something like this demo

17920483
min	max
each time this is called iterate through all elements and get the min max

17920483
min	max
each time a value is added or removed iterate over all elements and set global variables min max which you can then return on calls to findsmallest and findbiggest

17920549
width	height
for example if the image original size is 1000 by 1000 px if you resize in age the width and height will scale according to the square as both width and height are equal

17920551
filtering	grouping
then i could give the hard work of filtering grouping etc to the data source a database

17920551
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
another aspect of iqueryable that it s worth being aware of although this is really just a generic caveat about passing processing off to another system that may make different assumptions about the world is that you may find things like string comparison work in the manner they are supported in the source system not in the manner they are implemented by the consumer if your source database is case-insensitive but your default comparison in .net is case-sensitive

17920575
ienumerable	iqueryable
what you can do instead is to get the correct data from the database and convert the iqueryable to an ienumerable which is basically just a way to iterate through collections in-memory to do the rest of the operation in local memory as in

17920575
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable from the side of ef is that you should always try to filter the data using an iqueryable to get as little data as possible to convert to an ienumerable

17920584
children	parent
in other words it s not enough to set the parent container as display table and children as display table-cell

17920584
children	parent
if you set your css ignoring display table-row like i did opera sets the children elements after display table-cell as table-row and not as table-cell thus the width of each child extends to 100 of the parent and behaves like a row

17920602
min	max
for finding max and min without sorting

17920613
for-loop	loops
because the list of s and s is infinitely long a do while loops or for-loop would be the preferred method obtaining the information in

17920632
mouse	keyboard
these are events like mouse click keyboard events etc

17920638
width	height
i only want to scale it down by its width is fixed like 100px and the height scale down and maintain it s aspect ratio

17920692
calabash-android	calabash-ios
first time i am working on mac os x in this i need to install any sample ipa file and test using calabash-ios as like calabash-android.usually in calabash-android we will download apk file and signed it then install apk file in android device.then we will start create scenario using cucumber

17920820
google-chrome	safari
i think the prefix -webkit- consider only scroll bars on safari and google-chrome

17920827
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it works very well on google-chrome firefox but it did not work on safari

noexcept	throw
while this does make sense to me i don t understand why throw was checked dynamically in the first place or why noexcept does not provide exception guarantee other than calling std terminate instead of normal stack unwinding which is not really a solid guarantee imo

17922603
noexcept	throw
the only difficulty i see is that a function may or may not throw depending on runtime states - but that function should not be allowed to call itself noexcept anyway in my opinion

17922714

however this behaviour is a great problem for me since a smartbanner with a height of 90px on a 1200x800px mdpi screens takes up a lot more screens real estate than a smart banner with a height of 64px on an hdpi screens see screenshots below

17924551

while it s possible to restrict mpi to only use one machine and have shared memory see the rma chapter especially in mpi-3 if you re only ever going to use one machine it s easier to use some other paradigm

17924630
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

17924639
versioning	upgrade	google-chrome	firefox
by the way just as georg mentioned you don t need to restart google-chrome and firefox after checking the versioning of the plugin which means you have the routine to upgrade plugin and use the new one immediately

17924648
integer	fractions
html canvas supports fractions floating point coordinates so using an algorithm for integer coordinate based pixel canvas is not necessary and could be considered even counter-productive

17924649
width	height
i used a binary matrix with width n where n is the number of different costs and the height will be 2 n giving us all possible combinations

17924665
getter	setter
i tried to develop a very simple java webservice with jdeveloper 12 a single string variable with getter and setter

17924774
getter	setter
when using getter and setter there is no way to change class state without class knowing about it

17924784
width	height
also you have to set width and height to your last td

17924835
getter	setter
getter and setter are called correctly

17924835
getter	setter
but i need to set and get value of this dynamic property from objective c runtime so if i use functions like objc_getivar objc_setivar getter and setter aren t called at all and i m getting null pointer as result

17924966
mouse	keyboard
i am developing a software which needs to read from the mouse and keyboard device file

17924991
stdout	fflush
this is because there is no automatic fflush of stdout when redis-cli displays the messages associated to the subscription

17924997
post	get
if so i ended up using post method to simulate get method that had an object required to send over as a parameter

17925023
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
because it has support on ios safari and google-chrome opera on desktop

17925042
getter	setter
and get rid of most of your getter setter and access the variable values statically and it will be faster

17925075
put	get
the following code works without a problem but when the comments are put in i get the error mentioned above

17925095
keydown	keyup
the handler also detaches the keydown listener itself and attaches a keyup listener that sets up the event listeners back to their original states once the ctrl key is released

17925120
macports	homebrew
if that makes any difference i ve moved from macports to homebrew following these instructions

17925177

ps if there is something special you have to do to get anyone to answer respond to your post please feel free to share it in your response

17925181
mktime	strftime
look up mktime and strftime in the gnu awk manual

17925188
getter	setter
when you use dependency properties your getter and setter should only contain the usual things

17925194
for-loop	loops
it would be clearer to use the i++ as the iteration expression in the for-loop and not the printf and i does not need to exist outside of loops body

17925229
for-loop	loops
this is called a blank loops it is similar to empty for-loop

17925243
unix	bsd
this extension module is designed to match the api of ncurses an open-source curses library hosted on linux and the bsd variants of unix

17925323
postgresql	mysql
i m transferring over some queries from mysql to postgresql and i m stumped on how to rewrite the following query to work in postgresql

17925327
post	get
this will send the data through as a post variable instead of as a get variable as is the case in your code

17925403
put	get
suppose you want to get 50 data randomly than put your_limit_here 50

17925465
put	get
i ve noticed that you managed to get this working by using a method called put

17925542
submit	submission
when the a submit input is clicked submission is suppressed somehow

17925562
pop-up	dialog
for this i created a pop-up within the pagetemplate then inserted a dialogbox and within the dialog box i dragged and dropped my vo from the datacontrol panel and inserted it as an adf form

17925590
google-chrome	firefox
some browsers firefox google-chrome by design doesn t clean session cookies when you close them if you set some kind of remember me switch for example in firefox go to options- general- when firefox starts- show my windows and tabs from last time

17925623
google-chrome	firefox
especially for the ie browser frequently i found it is ok in other browsers like google-chrome and firefox

17925644
cpu	hyperthreading
but the xen hypervisor is reporting 1 cpu and 0 cores and hyperthreading enabled which makes no sense without any cpu core

17925647
ng-show	ng-hide
ng-show and ng-hide will only set a css display style and will still process the bindings

17925647
ng-switch	ng-show
do not rewrite your ng-show s as ng-switch es because of this

17925653
getter	setter
you can call the setter and getter methods indirectly by using the nsobject methods

17925653
getter	setter
also you can call the property setter and getter the same way you call other methods so you can use all of the dynamic method invocation features you can use with regular methods thought you probable have already worked that out

17925677
versioning	upgrade
so if possible upgrade your subclipse versioning to latest which is currently 1.8.22

17925707
min	max
boundary query lets you specify an optimized query to get the max min

17925707
min	max
else it will attempt to do min a.id max a.id on your --query statement

17925707
min	max
the results will be if min 0 max 30 is 3 queries that get run in parallel

17925821
pop-up	dialog
pop-up could be another situation where we could probably use a service but unlike a dialog a pop-up is attached to a dom node

17926012
min	max
then creates two new arrays of min and max using the first three and last three elements

17926038
processors	hyperthreading
i m running on a rather old pentium 4 2.8ghz with hyperthreading turned on which shows up as two processors in proc cpuinfo

17926038
cpu	hyperthreading
update 3 if i turn off hyperthreading in the bios this strange behavior goes away and the run always takes around 11 seconds of cpu time

17926099
put	get
so i have tried to put a variety of things in the parameter field but they always get returned as just strings saying for example document.hiddenfield.value not what is stored

17926123
google-chrome	safari
i know input type time is not supported across all browsers but for now google-chrome safari are our main focus which both support it

17926123
google-chrome	safari
i thought about maybe using .keyup to only calculate the duration once the user has finished typing in a time but google-chrome safari both provide the option of clicking arrows to increase decrease time so you can input data in a few ways

17926129
int	chars
i actually don t see the chars you need here but in debug mode you can find their value by placing a watch int myval

17926136
fflush	gets
i am aware that close automatically fflush the buffer but i am also aware that once the buffer is full and it receives more input it fflush it and then gets more input

if you want to use groovy code and grails plugins within the css you can use the gsp resources plugin

17926224

int	double
i tried using long long int and long double but these both outputted the same value

17926268

onfling	gestures
i have a gestures detector for onfling and have bound this listener to both textview as well scrollview

17926335

17926405
devise	cancan
i use devise for authentication and cancan for authorization

17926414
uielement	adorner
one of the uses for an adorner is to apply a visual overlay to uielement which sounds like your goal here

17926526
goto	break
since i ve used my first goto to break out of nested loops in...well...ever today i ll weigh in on this

17926526
goto	break
a goto or break means that you cannot guarantee that a code block will generate a valid postcondition for the next block as precondition you cannot prove your code correct since the break goto may skip essential parts of the code block

17926603
folder	dir
1 move the offending folder to my home dir delete it from svn and commit

17926612
int	double
but of course casting an to a is just going to produce gibberish for e since we d be reinterpreting the internal bits for an int as if they were in double format

17926612
int	double
i m working with a method that must return a double by dereferencing what used to be a void pointer to a double in shared memory but now may point to an int too

17926612
int	double
there is a hook that s invoked when the pointer is set to point to another location at which point it s known whether it s going to point to a double or an int

17926621

textview	imageview
better add a weight to your layout that contains your listviews and a weight to your textview and your imageview make sure your weighs are less than 1 and they all sum 1

17926844
textview	imageview
i don t know if this will work for you but i would change the parent layout to relativelayout then attach the imageview to the bottom and put the textview above that and place the two listviews above those using relativelayout properties

17926850
firefox	safari
as you can see here the colors between the allover-menue-background comming from the left and the right-part-background do not fit like they should for unknown reasons only in bottom part i have tested it with firefox 22 safari 6 and ie 10 - all with the same result

17926944
xlsx	xlsm
i can import xls xlsx and xlsm

17926945
mongodb	bson
mongodb stores data in a binary format called bson which supports these numeric data types

17926945
mongodb	bson	floating-point	integer
it s worth mentioning that the mongodb shell - being a javascript shell - doesn t recognise the distinction between integer and floating-point values it treats all numbers the same because javascript represents all numbers as 64-bit floating point regardless of their underlying bson type

17926966
centos	linux

ibatis	mybatis
a simple design approach that worked for me for a not very big webapp with ibatis mybatis is to use two layers for persistence

17927410
ibatis	mybatis
this layer is easy to create and maintain with tools like ibatis + ibator or mybatis + mybatisgenerator

17927446
getter	setter
getter and setter are called correctly

17927446
getter	setter
but i need to set and get value of this dynamic property from objective c runtime so if i use functions like objc_getivar objc_setivar getter and setter aren t called at all and i m getting null pointer as result

int	chars
what actually happens is that foo b 0 completely ignores foo int and instantiates foo chars instead

17930127
int	chars
but by the normal rules of overload resolution foo 0 is clearly an exact match for foo int and the only thing that makes foo chars a more viable match is the return type which should not be considered

17930133

the quickest but kinda hacky way is to append the rowindex to each choosethemetypedropdown id on the gridview s rowdatabound event

17933455
for-loop	loops
get past this problem quickly by using a while loops instead of the for-loop a bit like this

17933542
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
one last thing if you are just reading the arrays value you enhanced for-loop for-each loops syntax because it looks even cleaner and you can t make mistakes with the index variable or length

17933544
put	get
if you already have text in it then you just get that text and after opening up your sharedpreference put it all in with the original text last

min and max are unused the first time around

17933789
udp	tcp
the true way to get reliable udp is to use tcp

17933790
for-loop	loops
in this situation you normally can t use a for-loop for your inner loops

17933839

17934266
int	chars
there is a difference between reading the binary data as a chars vs reading the data as an int

17934266
int	chars
but if the chars is a letter like a which does not correspond to a valid int will fail silently it won t crash but it will return false

17934281
public	protected
here gettimezone is a protected or public method that should be declared in code behind class and return the necessary time zone

cobertura	jenkins
there is some problem due to overlapping sequences between jenkins cobertura plugin report publish and play framework cobertura module

17934325
cobertura	jenkins
removed jenkins cobertura report publish action from the main build job

17934325
cobertura	jenkins
we created a new jenkins job that is setup with publish cobertura coverage report action

17934325

17934395
post	get
in rails to secure possibly destructible requests post get and delete we use authenticity token

17934474
hide	show
if i had to guess at what you re trying to accomplish you might want to take a look at the ngif directive that was introduced in 1.1.5 to conditionally add a piece of dom not just show hide it

17934481
mouseup	mousedown
i m getting the .jsppane left position whenever i hover and in sequence mouseup the #super_feature its like dragging that s the only way i got it to work mousedown wasn t working

17934512
width	height
this code does the trick however i am trying to select the smallest thumbnail that equal 130 and above width 130 x height 130

17934512
width	height
meaning the width or height has to be 130 and above not the sum of width and height

17934512
portrait	landscape
so if it is a portrait or landscape dimension it would scale in dimension accordingly

17934512
width	height
so from the print_r below you can see the in the first array item 2 fits that description but the other arrays would be numbers 2 and 1 since this is the smallest above 130 width height

17934525
elasticsearch	kibana
i am trying to make logstash work with elasticsearch and kibana

17934550

after i run application and click in icon the window is show correct but after be hide set_visible false and re-shown i get a blank window

17934550
hide	show
trayicon on_button_release is where window is show and hide through set_visible

17934582

width	height
here is some code for you we are first setting up a picture array to compare against that has very large dimensions we are then looping though your arrays arrays to find an image that has both the width and height that is greater then 130 but the area is less then the selected image

17934777
width	height
you wouldn t be storing the whole thumbnail but i guess you could just do that by adding url width and height indexes to it

17934777
width	height
like mark said in his comment it s unclear if you want the total pixel size to be the smallest one or the width height

17934837
width	height
hint2 make the rows and columns for the top area the same width and height before you begin

17934837
width	height
hint3 holding alt as you drag row or column height width will display the width in pixels

17934854

in order to get only a few items of interest out of the nested json file i would suggest using the afnetworking library s afjsonrequestoperation to parse the json file and put the results into a nsdictionary

17934879
factors	matrix
since the matrix a is always constant lu factorization should be performed once and the factors are used subsequently in all threads

17934915
box-sizing	border-box
for consistency with form fields across browsers we use box-sizing border-box

17934988
put	get
put another way no matter if i click checkbox_3 or checkbox_6 i will get the value for that checkbox

17935019
accessor	properties
if you have control over the context and you probably do you can implement this with properties accessor

17935121
put	get	post	get	post	put
using the net http i want a way to get the current request string and the method get post put etc

17935171
ember.js	backbone.js
i know backbone.js can do everything with the right plugins and by respecting the best practices but what i m looking for is something more strong as is and from the start like angularjs canjs or ember.js maybe canjs is the best compromise between flexibility and conventions althought all of this can be mostly subjective

17935172
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
you are using getelementsbytagname oth1 instead of getelementbyid oth1

17935346
superclass	subclassing
if so having your superclass know all subclassing implementations smells bad - it violates the open closed principle

17935363
int	chars
both the chars literal a and the int literal 0x41 have type int

17935363
int	chars
the c standard does guarantee that whatever their actual values might be the chars literals 0 through 9 will be consecutive and in increasing numerical order if i is an int between 0 and 9 inclusive 0 + i will be the chars for the decimal representation of that int

17935374
min	max	min	rank	rank	max
so in this situation the rank is updated and i need to make sure it is between the min and max in the rangea on another datagrid

17935398
pbkdf2	hash
the password was hash in django with a pbkdf2 hasher with the hashing algorithm as sha256

hash	salt
as i understand it django passwords are stored so that the hash style is the first component the number of replications comes next then then the salt then the hash

17935406
awk	ksh
looks like you re trying to compare two arrays together and find the differences which can be accomplished by associative arrays in awk or ksh

17935435
width	margin
using margin auto only works for centering if the block-element to which you apply the style has a defined width given in pixel

17935435
background-position	background-size
that way you can center the image by using background-position center and make it span the whole width by using background-size cover

17935445
folder	directory
essentially my working directory contained contains a folder called www which contains all my static resources in subfolders css js etc

17935461

17935473
dictionary	map
i ve tried using a foreach loop foreach java.util.map.entry in map or foreach string key in map.keyset to add to the dictionary element-by-element but it seems that java maps and sets are not enumerable

17935530
post	get
i also test the request type post versus get to ensure that the download file isn t bookmarkable

i have a gridview and a detailsview in a asp.net webpage i will need to extract either one or the other for its information and i ve made a function for this

17935683
gridview	detailsview
both gridview and detailsview have a property named rows which is what i need to use in my function

17935683
gridview	detailsview	inherited	properties
i tried creating two classes that inherited from detailsview and gridview and simply use their parent s row properties both implement an interface which i then use in my main code but that doesn t seem to be working

17935683
gridview	detailsview	inherited	properties
reason being the return type of rows for detailsview and gridview differ both return types inherited from ienumerable but any class that implements the interface will need to have its row properties also return an ienumerable using generics bypasses this limitation but then fails in my calling code which complains that my object which implements gridview and detailsview can not be converted to the interface type

17935694
qmainwindow	qwidget
apparently assigning one widget to qmainwindow using setcentralwidget and then assigning another widget with setcentralwidget will cause the underlying c++ qwidget to be deleted even though i have an object that maintains reference to it

17935748
folder	directory
i have now realised that changing the directory tree so that the top level directory is testproject and so different to its child folder doesn t result in an empty source tarball and does only remove the files listed in cpack_source_ignore_files

17935749
width	height
updating images i m using get x y width height to get a snapsshot pimage of the rendered scene at the end of the draw render loop

gif	png
sometimes the files are jpg gif png etc

17935852
post	get
if you fix that and the code in your form is as i think it is with a submit button without an onclick or anything specified you first send a post request to the server with the right data and then when the request is finished and the json is loaded into your iframe as raw text you send another json request to the same url this time through a get request without containing any data and somehow expect to get the same response as you get in your iframe

17935852
submit	submission
if you use a submit button you need to prevent the default action and the view attached to your action url should handle default form submission

17935857

17936186
hive	hdfs
create hive tables with partitions and locations pointing to hdfs locations

folder	directory
i created a user to login via ssh without a password whose user s directory is the var www html folder so i have the ssh authorized_keys in the same folder

17936397
x86	64bit
since you need to load large amount of data in memory 1m rows 1kb per row 1gb your only reasonably option is to use build 64bit x64 application as address space restriction on x86 application 2gb on normal x86 system up to 4gb on x64 system will not allow to allocate enough memory

17936416
daemons	launchd
sql server fulltext search service and sql full-text filter daemons launchd

17936419
int	double
but it will only succeed because 100.0 has an exact representation as a double and the int value 100 will be converted to the same 100.0 double value via a widening primitive conversion

17936570
width	height
you can do this with js but you actually need to specify height and width when you re using a background

17941947
portrait	landscape
my idea of a solution is to put all of the ui elements inside a uiscrollview and set constraints on the scroll view so that it fills the screen in either portrait of landscape mode

17941947
portrait	landscape
after doing this the portrait view is as before in the simulator but in landscape view nothing scrolls and none of my ui elements respect their constraints stretch horizontally etc

17941959
width	height
if you mean the resolution of the image that can be used as a wallpaper without scaling and the resulting degradation in image quality its width should be 2 times the screen width with height equal to the screen height

also you can get post data values by

17942067
min	max
reason to use sometimes the primary key doesn t have an even distribution of values between the min and max values which is used to create the splits if --split-by is not available

17942067
min	max
--boundary-query by default sqoop will use query select min max from to find out boundaries for creating splits

17942114
portrait	landscape
if you want elements to completely change position when rotated however you re likely to need more than just constraints and would need to throw in some code to handle the transition between portrait and landscape

width	height
well only solution i can think of here is to get width and height of image and then asign those values to the div u want to resize

17942580
getter	setter
i m a bit confused about the use of getter setter and constructors see the below code for an example

17942580
getter	setter
all i ve learned is that we need getter setter for security and that they can also be used to change or edit values later on

17942580
getter	setter
wouldn t using the getter and setter provide security as well being able to easily change values at any stage

17942611
uiview	subviews
i ve several uiview s that act as subviews in my view controller vc and i have set outlet for those uiview in xcode

17942796
cos	sin
so if your desired axis of rotation is tilted 30 degrees from the z axis on the zx plane your axis of rotation is cos pi 6 0 sin pi 6 increment the rotation angle plug that into the rotation matrix to get matrix r the new camera position vector will be r x y z

17942802
width	height
you can try to make another div with 100 width and height inside your resizable div to hold the content

17942821
getter	setter
if you think about an object transitioning into different states then it makes sense to have a parameterized constructor alongwith setter and getter

17942821
getter	setter
once you get more details about the employee you use getter and setter to update the attributes

17942855
getter	setter
in several cases setter wouldn t be exposed but getter

17942855
getter	setter
in a nutshell getter and setter do have their own importance rather than initializing the object

17942902
min	max
i tried to project the points on the vectors in order to get the min max and mean values

17942902
min	max
i would like to get a box like centroid and min max in two directions

pop-up	dialog
you must split the code in 2 different parts one that executes and after is done pop-up a confirmation dialog and a second part where you submit the form to execute the remaining piece

17943040
pop-up	dialog
you can t do this in one shot because you can t have server-side code execute pop-up a confirm dialog on the client side and then continue on the server side

17943044

but i typically get much more consistent results using the native google-chrome now also in firefox and safari devtool methods console.time console.timeend

17943568
free	malloc
if you however don t really need dynamic memory allocation as in your case because you use the array only within the function then drop the call to malloc and free and use the compound literal only

17943575
int	double
expects a double as argument but yu pass an int

17943576
rtsp	rtmp
you better check rtsp or rtmp protocol and livu blog

17943615

should it always be calculated on the fly such as graphs and charts or should cron jobs be run every hour

instances	transient
if a decorator is transient then it should not call dispose on the decorated instances

17943884
margin	height
also using margin will not affect your element s dimensions whereas padding will make your elements dimensions set height + padding so for example if you have a 100x100px div with a 5px padding your div will actually be 105x105px

17943891
width	height
i have an anchor a that has height 40 and width 20px

17943893
integer	unsigned
the problem seems to lie inside a for-loop that goes where size is the size of a file stored in a memory buffer and i is an unsigned integer

17943900
hide	show
i think it would be better to apply the selectedemployee observable to the #panelwrapper so you can show hide it depending on the value of selectedemployee

17943934
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer is always

17943966
for-loop	loops
after that price has a length in any case so you can loops over it with your for-loop in the same way as if it was a nodelist

17943972
width	margin
margin padding and border values should be deducted from the width before assigning the width value in css

17943972
width	margin
for example width 100px padding 10px margin 10px border 5px means width of the total container is 150px 100px+20px left and right padding each 10px + 10px left and right border 5px each + 20px left and right margin

17944050
super	extends

17944213

many of these properties could be grouped reducing the overall number of attributes on the entity - i could possibly change groups of boolean into a series of int and do a logical and to check the factors i want

17944845
folder	directory
before doing all thing you need to set the ndkroot environment variable in environment settings to the root folder to your ndk directory in my case it is c adt-bundle-windows-x86-20130522 android-ndk-r8e

just make sure that the listbox height and width is set to the screen size or smaller

17948143

17948351
versioning	upgrade
so unless you can upgrade to a later versioning your solution seems like it may be the right one

17948352
for-loop	arrays
it depends a lot on the size of the arrays for-loop is very efficient but with very large arrays you can see improvement with array.copy or buffer.blockcopy

17948382
width	height
but in my case it scales either height wise or width wise

17948384

17948420
min	max
i need to reorder this list first according to the second items inside each list from max to min and then according to the first items from min to max

more specifically it enforces a programming style where superclass provide empty hooks that can be implemented by subclassing

17948785
superclass	subclassing
rationale this api design style protects superclass against beeing broken by subclassing

17948785
superclass	subclassing
the downside is that subclassing are limited in their flexibility in particular they cannot prevent execution of code in the superclass but that also means that subclassing cannot corrupt the state of the superclass by forgetting to call the super method

17948830
udp	tcp
i would use my own protocol on top of udp or tcp

17948901

17949551
comparator	comparable
then either create a comparator or implement comparable and override equals and hashcode

17949583
inherited	properties
the two virtual methods are where you can alter the dom which is populated in the doc properties of the csquerypage object - the intent of leaving them unimplemented here is that each aspx page that inherited csquerypage can optionally override them and make changes to the dom

17949590
google-chrome	firefox
i suspect you d see pretty significant performance improvements in both google-chrome and firefox since this is exactly the kind of thing asm is really good at

17949615
equals	tostring
i rarely use the method equals or hashcode in my production code and i only use tostring in debugging process but not in production so my question is

17949620

17949657
d3.js	raphael
the only place where raphael defeats d3.js is fallback

d3.js	raphael
raphael supports older versions of ie whereas d3.js is based on current web standards

google-chrome	firefox
but when i run this code on firefox google-chrome and ie are oke icon-arrow-right and 2-level dropdown aren t same a line

17950022
folder	directory
one thing that i found - if you remove a view model or use a folder or directory as a purgatory about to be deleted those files may not be used in your app but if they are in the file structure they will still be evaluated by the optimizer

17950083
maven	pom.xml
there you have a kind of default binding which is defined in the maven super pom.xml which defines the goals and their execution in the life-cyclce

17950136
for-loop	loops
if prices grows more or less with prices_distincts then if you multiply the size of prices_distincts by 10 your original 10 seconds will be multiply by 10 then again by 10 second for-loop and then by 2 because of the list prices that by the way should definitively be done out of loops

i imagined the process would be to override the load and save functions of a preferenceactivity to pull push the values from a pojo provided oncreate via an intent - and the return this pojo as an activity result to the caller

17950491
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
the point is that since you add salt to the hash some user can t simply use md5 on a changed id because he s missing the salt you used

17950520

now we use a lot of jquery to load up different sections of our dashboard we fadeout previous screens and fadein new screens

17950617
trac	bugzilla
bugzilla or trac integration

17950617
trac	bugzilla
taskcompiler found on the bugzilla wiki site seemed like a candidate because it talks to both bugzilla trac but their sales page is offline and the site hasn t been updated since 2012 and i m unsure as to their viability

17950617
trac	bugzilla
another thought that occurs to me is a gas script to push our current google forms based bug reports into trac or bugzilla

trac	bugzilla
edit the decision between bugzilla trac seems to have been made for us

cos and sin can be expensive operations

17954296

first with box-sizing border-box it s possible to make the label subtract the 1em gap from its own width leaving the input with exactly 80 of the width

17954296

it s also necessary to add an extra empty tag between the label and the input to hold the 1em margin since table cells can t have margin and include their padding in their width

17954302
post	get
please find below my code. even i get the id for that particular post

17954426
heroku	engineyard
my company uses engineyard for running andromo app maker for android and we use heroku for running airbop push messaging service for android

17954426
heroku	engineyard
while heroku limits you to a couple hundred small 512k instances or now double smalls engineyard will let you use extra large with tons of cpu and memory but in the real world it s all about the same in the end

17954426
heroku	engineyard
with heroku you might need to spawn a swarm of cheap little servers to handle your load or with engineyard you d use a handful of more expensive larger servers

17954426
heroku	engineyard
in my experience heroku s free included support is next to useless whereas engineyard is very good

17954437
put	get
if you put that into your routes.rb file and then in a console run rake routes you ll get the output

17954452
inject	interceptor

the option bitmaptype falls back to xlib if the test of cairo fails thus giving you a cryptic error message about x11

17955093

daemons work in the background and usually... don t belong to a tty that s why you can t use stdout stderr in the way you probably want

17955185
addition	multiplication
since the probability of actually observing 0 probability is very small and checking if a number is equal to 0 is least expensive as compared to addition or multiplication i would regenerate the random number repeatedly until it is not equal to 0

17955206
int	double
doing search and compare numbers are ok like in the example the trim double quotes sometimes would not be necesary as if you json_encode an int var it will be stored as number 99

17959613
submit	submission
i suspect behind the scenes the mixpanel api inspects the dom element looking for a child of type submit then hooks on a click listener in order to intercept the form submission so that the mixpanel tracking can be attempted before actually submission the form

17959618
sudo	passwd
sudo ssh sftp are all designed to know if there is a tty attached so they ask for a passwd

17959685
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
but google-chrome gives you err_file_not_found and firefox also fails with not found strangely opera seems to work try adding

17959706
sudo	passwd
edit it s probably better to wrap the particular command you want in a script and then allow them sudo access to the script w o a passwd

17959715
cassini	iis
turns out the issue was fixed by changing the project config to use local iis web server instead of visual studio developer server cassini

17959739
children	parent
furthermore if you attempt to delete the parent record without fixing the children then the parent cannot be deleted

17959753

17959808
hide	show
i m have a little trouble with this jquery show slow and hide slow

17959846

textbox textwrapping nowrap fontsize 38 text inputscope number height 60 width 103 margin 100 10 0 10

17959889
sudoers	passwd
keeping passwd in your script is always a bad idea and allowing access via modification to sudoers especially for something like make is a security hole

17959892
width	height
if you don t want the li s to move around when text is added to them or more specifically when the span is toggled try using display inline-block and setting a width and height

17959911

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
there seems to be a rendering difference between webkit browsers i see the boxes pushed down in google-chrome safari and opera 15 and others firefox and opera 12 have the boxes aligned to the top when vertical-align baseline and overflow hidden are applied

17960017
google-chrome	firefox
removing the overflow-y css gives me the same results boxes pushed down in both firefox google-chrome

17960017
webkit	gecko
so it seems like gecko is rendering according to the specification in this case whereas webkit is not

17960022
fadein	fadeout
if someone is looking for this answer i found the solution using the fadein and fadeout that alienhoboken said and calling the jquery animation

17960051
hide	show
instead and assuming you aren t after some css-only hack you would define a client-side js function to hide show the related area and attach it to an appropriate event on your h1 tags

17960054
width	height
the .show method animates the width height and opacity of the matched elements simultaneously

17960054
fadein	fadeout
i suppose you are looking for a fadein fadeout effect which has its own function in jquery

17960079
put	get
you could approximate that by including a final page in the extract that talks about where to get the full version or about the author or anything else and put something like and so on on that page

17960082
atoi	atof
the functions atoi atof and atol are standard c library functions specifically designed to convert strings into numerical values

17960282
stdout	stderr
i don t know the answer on the ruby end -- i d guess it is going to the ruby process stdout or stderr -- but gdb recently got a new feature that is designed to help with this scenario

17960318
fflush	gets
the result of that interaction will be communicated to your app via onactivityresult which itself needs to use a fully set-up iabhelper object and so if your app gets fflush from memory while the user is interacting with the billing service to make or cancel a purchase then onactivityresult will have to wait for the iabhelper instance to get set up again after it is re-created in oncreate before it can use it

17960323
width	height
it seems like it rotate the whole 3d context since 3d context has it own width and height so the picture looks like being stretched ha i got the answer when i write to here so set context3d to a square size solved the problem

17960356

17960609
strsplit	substr
joe duffy s blog implies using substr is more efficient than strsplit

17960670
int	double
i assume it returns double as its more versatile for example if your xml contains product prices and it only returned int you would never get a correct sum of price

17960670
int	double
and since you can simply cast double to int it makes perfect sense to use double for count

17960689
maven	pom.xml

17973610
rss	feed
its very important that this top rated nodes have his own rss feed so people can subscribe just to the x bests posts

17973610
rss	feed
reading other related questions i guess showing the top rated questions is possible using a view but i don t know how to translate or export this view into a rss feed

17973634
width	height
hides the url width and height variables and the init function within the anonmyous function

17973634
width	height
however i do not like this approach much because the init and run functions have to work with variables like url width and height

17973706
google-chrome	firefox
as well as in certain web-based email clients firefox google-chrome explorer

17973797
for-loop	loops
next time round the do...while loops we skip the for-loop because kor is 1 thereby printing 5

i m using internationalization and entity translation modules to translation contents and blocks in the page

17973932
children	parent
i m trying to figure out the best way to create a sql statement in sql server to duplicate a parent record and all the children records

17973972
put	get
one alternative approach would be to put the contents into a hidden div and just get your click function to unhide it

17973989
folder	directory
the hosting provider uses websitepanel through which i was able to create a virtual directory for the folder containing the mvc application

17973998

i d like to be able to show or hide content in a sidebar based on the height of the adjoining content div but i m not exactly sure if how it can be done

17974157
post	get
for example on the blog page of my current project i have two widgets in the sidebar one for latest tweets and one for latest music news however as you can see on this page the content of the blog post all test posts... are much longer than the height of the two widgets and would of course get larger as more post are added

17974166
post	get
if that post failed to meet your answer please get back to me with what you had try

17974178
textview	imageview
simply what i am attempting to do is have the imageview take up 1 3rd of the screen across the width while having the layout of textview take up the remainder of the 2 3rds of the screen across the width

17974207
int	boolean
casting boolean true to int will give 1 you can not add boolean values directly

17974229
width	height
edit so i just looked a little more at your xml and realized it s probably more because of the width and height you are using

17974253
google-chrome	firefox
please check the jsfiddle here for a working example i have tested it with google-chrome firefox and ie i know d

17974262
for-loop	loops
in your case may be you can append the for-loop counter i to the marker variable such as marker_+i and then fire the click event on those variables inside the same loops

17974282
width	height
i am able to adjust the width of the column however i cannot figure out how to adjust the height or amount of lines that get displayed

17974285
oncreate	ondestroy
register them in oncreate de-register in ondestroy and send data through intents .

sin and cos take radians as input not degrees

17974391
cos	sin
you ll need to convert your angles to radians before passing them into sin and cos

17974393
children	parent
for your example it would be far more efficient to simply have the children touch the parent

17974393
post	get
you may need to actually access the child records in a more complicated example but for ordering by the date of the child post this saves you having to get the extra records out of the database when you don t actually need information from that table

17974411
hash	salt
when using hash functions with passwords or sensitive data developers generally append salt strings to it to help prevent easy break of these hashs

17974411
salt	md5
i see that in your code you just use md5 on the password without any kind of salt

17974411
hash	salt
and maybe on the other point of the script in the function that adds user to the database for example you are hashing the password with some salt and obviously the hash won t match

17974427
submit	submission
now for your problem you always prevent the form from submission because you always do event.preventdefault you need to prevent the submit only if something is invalid in your form try like this instead

implements	extends
a possible fix for this would be to make your serialreader extends thread rather than implements runnable and then assigning reader to be a new instance of the serialreader directly

17974659

press save run a python validation code if code returns false continue with the original save functionality else pop-up a dialog box dialog box ok save the entity cancel stay on the change_form page

17975043
x86	64bit
as for pushing a 64bit value onto a 32-bit stack you ll need to push the two halves separately - since x86 is little-endian with a push-down stack you ll need to push the upper-32 bits first followed by the lower-32 bits

17975095
children	parent
that positions the children relative to the parent borders

17975098
width	height
also make sure you use inline styling for your tds height and width sometimes the regular html value won t do

17975108

17975280
floating-point	integer
floating-point instructions typically have longer latencies than integer instructions but they are pipelined so that throughput may be comparable

17975280
floating-point	integer
e.g. a floating-point unit might have four stages to do the work so an instruction takes four cycles to work through all the stages but you can push a new instruction into the first stage in each cycle. whether the pipelining is sufficient to provide performance on a par with an integer implementation depends greatly on the target processor the algorithm being used and the skill of the implementor

17975514
put	get
the reason you get no error when you don t put datatype json is because the json parser is not attempting to read your malformed json

17975577
stdout	stderr
you re first redirecting stderr to stdout which by default goes to tty terminal

17975577
stdout	stderr
and then you re redirecting stdout to a file files.lst however remember that stderr doesn t redirected to file since you have stderr to stdout redirection before stdout to file redirection

17975577
stdout	stderr
however in 2nd case you change the order of redirections first stdout to file and then stderr to stdout and that rightly redirects stderr to a file which is also being used by stdout

17975626
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

17979519
awt	swing
before i go on discussing the basic query i would first like to state that i am fully aware of my question being against the standards of the awt swing framework

17979519
awt	swing
the awt swing framework is built upon a event based model which uses a single thread to dispatch events

17979519
invokelater	invokeandwait	awt	swing
all awt swing related events events must be processed on the event dispatcher thread edt and any custom events that the programmer has programmed must be queued through the functions invokeandwait and invokelater

17979519
awt	swing
years ago before i got more familiar with the awt swing model and the edt i used to write code that violates many many java standards code that ll make any reasonable programmer recoil in horror

17979519
awt	swing
of course i know from one tiny example one cannot simply determine the awt swing standards are over-protective or unnecessary

17979519
awt	swing
nb i have never seen nor analyzed the source code of the awt swing framework and all my knowledge is based on internet research and personal experience

17979525

17979713
udp	tcp
if the choices are craft some reliability into udp or go with a proven option like tcp i would definitely go the tcp route

17979713
udp	tcp
there is a similar thread on this that mentions a number of options aside from udp tcp you might consider using before implementing something custom

17979715
qtwidgets	qtgui
note that you don t need qapplication or linking to qtwidgets to just draw upon a qimage using qguiapplication and linking to qtgui is sufficient

17979719
udp	tcp
for a simple installation tcp will be faster and simpler than trying to implement your own reliable udp

17979721
express	node.js
i m currently using node.js latest build with express web framework

17979763
button	checkbox
the problem it was written for a radio button form element not checkbox

ubuntu	linux
the code was originally written on a windows system but when i ran it on a linux system ubuntu the crypt function was then using the sha-512 algorithm which needed a longer column length

17979792
post	get
i found that your code is actually designed for get method.and in this case is not important to use post instead of get. because no parameter is passed and also its not a form.. and also agrees to jackson

17979797
udp	tcp
udp might be viable if you re looking ahead into a huge project but simple tcp design might likely be up to even a large task

17979798

in the code behind i set the datacontext of the control to an observablecollection which holds an object that inherited from ilist which you could use any object that does so and that object holds the object that contains the properties x and y properties

17979963
children	parent
all children of a parent record parent uid 42 can then be retrieved from your controller like that

17979966
sorting	filtering
this will involve creating custom sorting custom filtering and custom paging but it will dramatically increase the performance of your code as you ll be retrieving only a pages-worth of data at a time from the db instead of all 17 000 rows at a time

17979973
mongodb	bson
you can also consider bson which is used by mongodb

17979973

17980157

for the client s data you also don t want a separate database per client because it doesn t scale well and would be a maintenance mess if you need to upgrade your application and databases to a newer versioning

17980158
versioning	upgrade
it depends on castle windsor 3.0 or greater so you can t reference it via nuget unless you upgrade cw to that minimum versioning

17981080
uiview	subviews
the yellow-blue squares are actually subviews of a rectangular parent uiview and the transform was applied to the parent view

17981089
move	drag

17981315
hash	hmac
if you insist on using two hash functions then i would submit that instead of concatenating two hash the better approach would be to instead use a hmac using two different hash functions algorithms

17981336
hash	md5
the problem with finding md4 and md5 hash collisions is that it s possible to make a chain of devices that would allow attacker to linearly scale number of attack attempts and given large enough budget this sounds plausible

17981352
stringstream	ifstream
i m not much of a c++ person so i would write the data to a file the c way with fwrite but if you want to do it the c++ way i think you re looking for ifstream rather than stringstream

the problem is both main.c and windowinitialize.c depends on the glew and glfw libraries

17981565
glfw	glew
the main.c source though still uses both glew and glfw for main loop purposes referring to functions and such from both

17981565

both files need to make use if the glew and glfw libraries as well as stdio actually for printing debugging messages and such

textview	imageview
each item would be shown as a relativelayout with 2 imageview one below the other and a textview on the right of the upper one

17981761
textview	imageview
the upper imageview would have the large dot filled or not with optional dots above it and the imageview below would stretch its size according to the textview align to its bottom plus add some more for extra small-dots and have tiled dots as its background

17981761
textview	imageview
another approach would be to have a listview of textview and an imageview on its left and you draw the circles according to what the listview is currently showing even while scrolling

17981781

if that is exactly what you want to do all javascript objects in firefox google-chrome some others have the __definegetter__ property that you can use to define lazy-calculated values

17997533
google-chrome	firefox
currently i tested only in ie firefox and google-chrome and google-chrome is not showing it at all

public	protected
the main disadvantage to this was that the types and members being protected had public visibility and the verification only happened at runtime

17997754
post	get
the static constructor will only get called once and not per post back as you ve also seen i don t believe you should expect any different behavior based on the browser or iis

put	get
in my get routes i can access the session but in my route with put method its always undefined

17997918

the other respondents have clearly laid out the case against doing arithmetic on factors but if such coercion were meaningful say by having some ordinal interpretation then this code which coerces to a matrix would be reasonably compact

17997965
oncreate	setcontentview
move your view initialization inside oncreate after setcontentview

17997973
nfa	dfa
there are various algorithms that could help you to convert nfa to dfa

17997973
nfa	dfa
for any nfa there is a corresponding dfa whose states correspond to sets of states in the nfa.

17997973
nfa	dfa
so for we would need to build nfa for ab then nfa for bc then join the two nfas and build the dfa of the entire big nfa

17997973
nfa	dfa
once you have nfa you can convert it to dfa where each state will contain whether it is a subsequence of abc or acd or maybe both

17997973
nfa	dfa
if you convert above nfa to dfa you get

17998020
firefox	safari
this solved the problem on safari android s default browser but not on firefox

17998057
width	height
if you can tolerate hard-setting the height and width that is

17998057
width	height
you need inline-block to get the browser to obey height and width on a span element

17998057
width	height
as long as the square height width are bigger than the text and the container height is bigger than the square height you should be good

17998065
libxml2	libxslt
also the necessary dependencies i have installed libxml libxml2-devel libxml2 libxslt libxslt-devel.

17998095
getter	setter
and getter setter of forcex and forcey was not there earlier but i just made it inside the class which looks like this now

17998119
post	get
whether or not to register the egpcs environment get post cookie server variables as global variables

17998161
post	get
for example a get request with no custom headers is similar to a jsonp request while a post request with no custom headers is similar to a javascript form.submit

17998177

an int constant expression shall have int type and shall only have operands that are int constants enumeration constants chars constants sizeof expressions whose results are int constants and floating constants that are the immediate operands of casts

17998184
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
edit slightly modified approach since you want to mix multiple views on the same page which generally should mean within a single parent uiviewcontroller you do not want a uipageviewcontroller and a uitableviewcontroller since each of these wants to own the entire screen

17998184
uitableview	uipageviewcontroller	uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller	uipagecontrol	uitableview	uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
instead you want a uiscrollview + uipagecontrol to simulate the uipageviewcontroller and a uitableview all within a single uiviewcontroller

17998184
uipagecontrol	uitableview
you then hook up the delegate methods of the uiscrollview uipagecontrol and uitableview datasource and delegate to methods within your uiviewcontroller class implementation

17998189
subtract	add
you can add or subtract months from a given date by using datetime.addmonths

17998224

wildfly	jboss
and finally jboss 7.x line is nowadays superseded by wildfly and eap 6.x line by eap 7

17998319
bitwise-or	bitwise-and
thus if it were a cas operation for byte where the comparison is done not by just checking the equality but doing some bitwise operation like bitwise-and or bitwise-or then it would be possible to do cas for bits

17998361
width	height
also it seems you are creating a view with 0 width and 0 height with that layout params

17998378
hex	binary
however if i use a hex editor and open up any of the library object files produced or the final application binary i find a whole bunch of plain text references inside the output binary to the file paths of the c files that were compiled

17998428
for-loop	loops
if you only want to enter one number don t use a loops and a vector is not required if you want to enter a certain number of numbers you will need a for-loop which executes a set number of times

17998440
spaces	linefeed
strings that are being compared might have white spaces linefeed newline characters

17998452
width	height
if you want your textview to take up the remaining width of the screen i would leave the weight as 1 the width as 0 but you need to set the height to a constant like wrap_content

17998457
post	get
use a form and a get or post method to get the value on next page

17998459
gtk	cairo
install gtk and cairo with homebrew

17998459
macports	homebrew
i never managed to make this work with macports but eventually i ve been successful with homebrew after many fruitless attempts

17998459
gtk	cairo
then i basically uninstalled x11 gtk cairo and all their dependencies

17998459
gtk	cairo
most people may found this bizarre i did but installing yarp installed sequentially all the needed dependencies to make gtk work obviously i tried just to install gtk and cairo but it never worked or eventually rgtk2 failed to compile

17998488
int	double
int unix epochs are implicitly cast to double precision.

17998497
google-chrome	firefox
neither google-chrome firefox ie wget nor curl complain about it

17998544
pull	push
basically you ave two extra schemas shadow and fake create identical copies of your tables in the shadow schema and then perform an operation like this probably best to have this run on the 2005 server and pull rather than push form 2012 so you don t have to worry about distributed transactions etc

17998546
filtering	grouping
i understand why companies are using service-now how it is used but i would like to learn how to configure it configure workflows for service catalog requests create grouping to filtering tickets between different it teams and create ui policies and scripts

17998611
put	get
to get a better control over what you are doing you can find the files first using the command you already posted with -print insted of the gzip command put them into a file and use this file filelist.txt to uinstruct tar with what to archive

17998614
idictionary	ilist
jsonpath doesn t come with its own parser so as per rick sladkey s advice i m using json.net to parse my json string into a collection of nested idictionary objects ilist arrays and primitives

17998654
hide	show
the approach i am using to do this is to have an extra textview in my list_item.xml that i dynamically hide or show based on whether a new divider is needed for the next letter

17998671
cuda-gdb	jcuda
you should be able to use regular cuda debugger nsight or cuda-gdb to debug the gpu code in your jcuda application

17998723
button	checkbox
for clarity let s say that i have a checkbox that i want to check and uncheck using two button

17998744
accessor	superclass
we will override the accessor methods from the superclass

17998744
superclass	subclassing
in the mapping document we will tell moxy that the real superclass of subclassing is java.lang.object

17998745
put	get
i have the duplicate function working fine in theory ie it works in jsfiddle but as soon as i take it and put it into place i cannot get it to work on the site itself running in chrome running the same spec jquery as the fiddle

17998749
put	get
i ve tried googling this message but get 0 results if i put it in quotes and nothing relevant if i don t

17998811

17998893
int	boolean
used a converter to convert boolean to an int

17998896
button	checkbox
the radio button command fires on every click not just when it is checked but we get away with this because unlike checkbox it is not possible to un-check a radio button so double-clicking the radio button will only confirm the seleceditem

17998906
hide	show
i would suggest if you want to show an hide divs that you use client side javascript

17998922
apache	nginx
a good solution is to continue to run nginx on port 80 while adding proxy directives to nginx to serve as a proxy for specific domains that are running on apache

17998973
overwrite	preserve
on a startup of the subsystem again based on my processing those 1-bit values will either be preserve or overwrite by new values

17999004
profiling	instrumentation
the best way to check it is analysing your code product analyze also run the instrumentation product profiling and check the memory leaks

17999027
actionmethod	html.beginform
i have seen something with html.beginform but since i believe that in order for a order to pass through the inputs must be passed to an actioncontroller and to the actionmethod responsible for the buttonclick

17999050
folder	directory
for organizational purposes i want to group a type of page into a folder to keep it out of the main source directory

17999083
post	put
i must use a map since a library that i am using to make multipart post requests requires that i put the file in a map

17999101
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this works just fine but these urls will be clicked from a variety of browsers and devices

17999192
width	height
this is a little javacript that checks the width and height then sets the document location if it isnt wht you specified but it is being echoed from php

17999203
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i faced the same problem but finally figured out that the uiview hasn t been created at the point in the code where you re trying to set background gradient which i guess in your case might be one of the following - viewdidload or - viewwillappear because of which

17999261
spaces	delimiter
scan separates the string into words by a delimiter by default spaces and returns the word you ask for 1 here

17999277
post	put
i am not sure what is going wrong as i am asking for the put action and the pair object is trying to do a post

17999282
superclass	subclassing
any other example of naming a member the same as a member of a superclass is not called overriding but hiding and is a completely different concept the subclassing member is in no way related to the superclass member it just happens to have the same name

17999282
inherited	subclassing
the subclassing may even inherited the same-named member and thus have two same-named members which can still both be accessed by qualifying the member name with the class name

17999324
post	get
or you could get the raw post data and try it with that string

17999342
strlen	substr
if you know the special ids will always end in xd you can easily use strlen and substr to write yourself an endswith function

17999409
int	double
a year is an int which is a number a percentage is a double which is a number etc

17999462
apktool	proguard
when i try to run proguard via the build- generate signed apktool in android studio i get hundreds of errors of the form

17999482
multiplying	subtract
those multiply-accumulate subtract instructions are issued back-to-back with the previous multiplying instruction without any latency

17999524
folder	dir
i managed to change my entire code to use dir instead of looping each cell in spreadsheet and looping each file in my folder

17999564
short	base
i can make both step classes have a base step class and create a short method to get browser instance or any shared instance created in setup just to hide scenario.context.current

17999905
post	put
can someone tell me how to post a tile notification and where we should put the images

17999933
tostring	getter
you have set the getter method to tostring so

17999945

if your values are simple int then the query will go fast but chars and strings will take longer because it needs to compare more

17999949
background-color	transparency
what you could do instead is to use the background-color style to only override the transparency part but as i pointed out earlier the v-tree-node element contains both the caption and children elements so your background color will be visible behind any child nodes and slightly to the left even if you style the background-color of the child node

18000745
addition	modulo
edit_add i have take a little time to look into the soa modulo optimizations and see that in addition to the above squarefree optimizations which probably won t make much difference that the quadratic sequences have a modulo pattern over each 15 elements that would allow many of the passed toggled composite test values to be pre-screened and would eliminate the need for the specific modulo 12 operations for every composite number

18000745
range	minimum
this means that the call return sequences aren t kept to a minimum depth as for soe but that this depth increases beyond being proportional to number range

18000769
width	height
my solution animates both width and height of the .item elements when toggling an additional .hidden class on them

so after each ajax call value of hidden field will be updated and ready to be post with form which your composite component lays in

18000888
sorting	filtering
for multiple sorting with kendo ui you can find it in the documentation and jqgrid is in the same link under searching filtering multiple fields for the example click on the search icon and with it should give you an option to search by multiple columns

18001043

in google-chrome and firefox the body of the response to gapi.client.request is a string of characters that partially changes when the content of the document is changed with the realtime api

18001043
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
in safari the gapi.client.request response body contains the same string of characters as on google-chrome and firefox eyjh... but the correct contents of the exported document are shown in the console log the same as when i use a browser window with the googleapis.com url

ant	maven
and i would use ant over maven for any new or existing project

18001133
ant	maven
for me it turned surprised when the experienced programming talk about the difficulties of maven when i saw ant in some project maven showed me a miracle

18001133
ant	maven
imo to understand maven you first have to understand ant and what maven tried or tries to solve

18001133
ant	maven
there are practical as well as stupid reasons to prefer ant over maven and vice versa

18001133
ant	maven
it just so happen that the split happen to be around 1 3 favoring maven and 2 3 favoring ant

18001133
ant	maven
with that said i would use gradle for a new system or rewrite an ant or maven build system into it if i had the authority and the developers around me were half-competent at the least.

18001133
ant	maven
it is simply a superior build system compared to ant and maven

18001192

18001239
mouse	keyboard
what s worse is that one can transition from some of these classes to others plugs in a mouse connects to keyboard or a user may appear to be on a normal laptop until they reach out and touch the screen

18001239
mouse	keyboard
an aside the browser does know when a user plugs in a mouse connects to a keyboard but doesn t expose it to javascript

18001243

it s also worth noting that if you are debugging running in visual studio the config file will get overwrite each time you perform a new build - so updated settings won t be preserve between runs of the application

parent will always be fed to the function before their children

18001520
children	parent

18001551
oncreate	setcontentview
on activity fragment oncreate based on current hour i could setcontentview

18004836
apache	nginx
apache settings are fairly standard but the nginx settings were customized considerably

width	height
i have a very similar question to the one asked at css width height of img and td

18005120
width	height
inspecting them using development tools shows there is both height and width added but checking all the style elements including inherited elements we cannot see any padding margins or borders

18005120
width	height
even if we explicitly define the td to the same width and height as the image it contains we still get the extra space

18005124
for-loop	arrays
arrays#fill can only work on a one-dimensional arrays so you ll have to iterate over the rest of the dimensions in a for-loop yourself.

one thing the accepted answer did not cover is you are supposed to override equals object and gethashcode for to work correctly

18005175
disk	ram
we are using vs2012 with plenty of ram disk etc

18005178
put	get
you can then put this in a subquery to get the values you want

18005281

this custom view simply change the position of an icon picture on the screen randomly when is invoked updateposition and in my intention should move the image on drag scale on pinch.

18006015
folder	directory
if the directory and files were named like folder 001 file 001.jpg you could just use a for-loop

gunicorn	uwsgi
uwsgi or gunicorn the latter being simpler which is most ofter set up as single threaded multi-process workers

jpql	hql
it s simpler to use sql directly - being close to sql like hql jpql is not the same especially if you talk to your db performance tuner

the image you were talking about has a specific width and height set as html attributes which gives it the same width of its parent thus it s taking the whole space

18006149
post	get
to get a better answer please post the code of the featured image css and html

18006212
minimum	diagonal
and now for the more complicated part if there s another point on the segment which is closer to x3 y3 - if we connect these points - we ll have a new segment that will be diagonal to the original segment - we have to use that together with a first degree equation for a line to find that third point and see if it s on the segment or outside if it s outside of the segment then we ll take the minimum distance between x3 y3 to the other two points

18006247
margin	text-align
ditch the inline-block text-align center stuff and just float your list elements and put margin 0 auto on the list container

18006247

18006637
super	self
when we type super ab self it means find then next class after ab in __mro__ chain of self

18006637
super	self
then we should invoke super in b looking for the next class in the chain after b super b self

18006637
super	self
it s important to use super and not call manually a.__init__ self ... etc. as it may lead to problems later

18006651

i have the following code that works well in google-chrome and firefox but not ie8 or i m assuming versions lower than 8

18006739
directx	direct2d
there are samples for directx xaml integration and i think there might even be a vs project template for integrating these that includes direct2d code though possibly in a single project natice c++ app whereas you would need to create a native winrt component that exposes a c++ cx api to your application to put in either a swapchainpanel best option but requires windows 8.1 swapchainbackgroundpanel good option but full-screen only or a surfaceimagesource

18006750
minimum	max

2 declare the field in the parent as private and then create getter and setter to access the field

18006810
getter	setter
create a private field and have setter and getter which can be protected to make them accessible only to subclasses

18006810
getter	setter
other options if you don t need a setter just a getter

you can use tmpfs or a ram disk

18007957
draggable	droppable
the main issue is caused by making the td draggable and droppable

18007957
move	drag
when you drag a td and drop it on another td then you physically move the td out of the table so the drop point changes

18008350
width	height
now if we rotate the blue box 90deg our height will become width and the width will be become height

18008350
width	height
now lets see if our height become width as you can see when we increase the height to 200px its become wider so it means our height is already a width

18008411
google-chrome	firefox
however i see larger rendered text on firefox than on google-chrome on os x

stateless	stateful
the following requirements apply to stateless and stateful session beans

18008827
stateless	stateful
the container serializes calls to each stateful and stateless session bean instance

18008827
stateless	stateful
therefore a stateful or stateless session bean does not have to be coded as reentrant

18008830
getter	setter
make sure you have a getter and setter for every bean property you reference in your code

18008830
getter	setter
primefaces will fail ungracefully on the wizard step in exactly this manner if it is unable to find both a getter and a setter - even for properties which you are only reading

18008830
getter	setter
addendum also the getter and setter should only do a get and a set of a local value

18008830
getter	setter
primefaces doesn t handle other getter and setter well i cannot explain why this doesn t work but i ve certainly observed it

18008833

18009687
width	height
width wise the popup is center aligned but height wise the popup is moving up

18009731
stdout	stderr
ok so if it did reliably solve the problem then that most likely means that you have to read the external processes stdout and stderr streams in parallel

18009731
stdout	stderr
the external problem is most likely alternating between writing stuff to stdout and stderr

18009736
calloc	malloc
according to this when sizeof is applied to the name of a static array identifier not allocated through malloc calloc the result is the size in bytes of the whole array rather then just address

18009739
boost	allocator
once you implement that block+vector approach a better performance comparison at that point would be to compare boost s pool_allocator vs std allocator

18010425
margin	height
.outerheight - returns the height of the div including border but excludes margin

18010500
pow	math.h
for power you need the pow function in math.h

18010548
int	double
later when summing or performing other calculations - the int cent and quantity values are first converted to double precision floating-point

18010548
int	double
the double precision format allows expressing int values assuming int cents precisiely in the range - 2 53-2 0 to 2 53-2 0 which probably you need to check covers your needs

18010548
int	double
keep in mind though that you will still have int cents in the double which need to be converted to dollars and cents

18010580
postgresql	mysql
hibernate supports relational databases like mysql postgresql oracle db2 and sql server

18010651

18011267
width	height
it works however i have to specify width height for this border control explicitly as the predefined tiles are enlarging the grid

18011312
children	parent
but what we re finding is that it still somehow evicts the parent when the children are still in the cache

18011312
children	parent
this is a problem for us because the children maintain a reference to the parent and the removallistener closes the parent which closes file handles required to continue using its descendants

it will resize fluidly as the element changes size it will modify the font-size not just on document ready or load allows for min and max font sizes and has some other options to allow you to tweak its behavior

18020326
getter	setter
note that object.create can t be perfectly shimmed though because amongst other things it can create non-enumerable properties or properties with getter and setter which you can t do on all pre-es5 browsers

18020326
getter	setter
you can do getter and setter on some pre-es5 browsers using proprietary syntax but not on ie8 i don t believe. it can only be pseudo-shimmed

18020346

i did this initially by putting a bit of code like this in the rowdatabound event of the gridview

18020393

18020669
inherited	subclassing
now i want subclassing to inherited the getprivatevar method

18020725
int	chars
i was trying to read from a file of int each line separately and to terminate my loop when finding a n but the problem with the lines was that in the end of each line first was a space chars and then a newline one so i couldn t use the scanf and then fgetc to terminate my loop

inherited	subclassing
it cannot be inherited or changed by the subclassing

18020805

18020995
filesystems	ntfs
the problem that you are facing is that windows filesystems ntfs is case insensitive so in windows billview.php and billview.php are the same file

18020995
filesystems	xfs
on linux as you might be guessing now the typical filesystems ext2 3 4 xfs reiserfs... are case sensitive and for that reason billview.php and billview.php are or may be different files

18021000
stateless	stateful
three files index.php navigation.php and footer.php combined together using esi where first two files are stateful but only index.php is cachable while footer.php is completley stateless

18021002
for-loop	arrays
but since you never appended a null terminator the above for-loop will iterate past the bounds of the arrays until it sees a null somewhere on the stack or it segfaults

18021013
pop-up	dialog
if what you want is more of a non-modal dialog which sounds like you may want...you can use as jerry suggested create your own based on pop-up or using a 3rd party toolkit like callisto which provides the flyout base for you

18021021
pivot-table	crosstab
of course i don t want two rows if a source and target exists so this would be rolled up via crosstab pivot-table query so the final row would be

18021057
button	checkbox
as brian already said radio button seem like a more organic way to achieve this result but you still could do this with checkbox if you wanted

18021083
zfcuser	bjyauthorize

for example neither tcsh or zsh have this issue

18021169
int	boolean
each item of the array may be of one of the following types boolean int string or date

18021172
intersect	contains
if you break up the rod into n equally spaced pieces where n is the number of original irregularly spaced segments you have in your rod and then record for each of the n equal-sized pieces which of the original irregular segment s it overlaps then to do a query you first just take the query point and do simple round-off to find out which equally spaced piece it lies in then use that index to look up which of your original segments intersect the equally spaced piece and then check each intersecting original segment to see if the segment contains your point and you can use binary search if you want to make sure the worst-case performance is still logarithmic

18021172
intersect	contains
when you have a uniform query point and compute the expected number of irregular segments that intersect the regular segment that contains the query point each regular segment has probability 1 n of being chosen by the query point so the expected number of intersect irregular segments that need to be checked is 2 n+1 n o 1

18025931
udp	tcp
tcp are connection oriented while udp are connectionless

18025931
udp	tcp
so the api s that specify tcp and udp use sockets to create those connections

18025938
hide	show
do it in your cell subclass and make the view publicly visible or add a method to show and hide it

18025947
noexcept	throw
btw what is noexcept not throw

of course that doesn t work because the subclassing doesn t have the method it s on the superclass

18028846
superclass	subclassing
that works like a charm haha except for the tiny detail that it works by taking the method off the superclass the first time a subclassing is loaded

18028846

subclass	abstract-class
abstract-class encapsulate general features that are common to a range of data types - features which are too general to be meaningful in the abstract-class but which can be overridden in a subclass

18030001
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing of an abstract-class overrides provides an implementation of every abstract method in its superclass the subclassing is called a concrete class and objects of the subclassing can be created

18030001
inherited	subclassing
if a subclassing of an abstract-class does not override implement all of the abstract methods it inherited that subclassing itself is also abstract and must be declared as such

now time increments are fifteen minutes and you get 15 post and 180 gets

18030181
post	get
the new api provides granularity to the level of each api access point - instead of just a bucket of 350 tokens it looks like every conceivable post type action is limited by type to 15 per each quarter hour and get type actions are limited to 180 per quarter hour

check it with localhost or 127.0.0.01 or a lan ip of your choice

18030968
google-chrome	firefox
i ve just checked your code in google-chrome 28 and firefox 22 and it worked fine

18031049
distance	pdist
the first input does not appear to be a distance matrix because its size is not compatible with the output of the pdist function

18031076
post	put
well basically you need to put your loader on top of ajax post element using some kind of absolute positioning or w e else you can do

18031076
hide	show
what you do on ajax request is hide control element and show loader in success and of course error function handlers you show control element and hide loader

18031094
tiff	png
the same for another image formats like png tiff wmf and so on libpng-devel libtiff-devel libwmf-devel ghostscript-devel etc

18031097

18031191
hide	show
bsic idea literally show only one block and just hide all other rows

18031221
multiplying	multiplication
the question why does this happen only when multiplying with 100 even though there is a precise representation for 110.0 is still unanswered but i suppose there is no simple answer other than fully stepping through a floating-point multiplication thanks to dax fohl for stressing that 10 is nothing special in binary

18031231
hide	show
the issue is if i switch the focus from uitextview to uiwebview the keyboard window flicker hide and then show

18031243

data getting was performed via get or post method from paypal site with array default

18031244

now not only can you print the parts you can pass the struct to other functions like strftime mktime etc

18031337
put	get
example i wanted get a specific customerid and put it into a string variable call custid

18031349
jobs	cron
if i have five cron jobs five items are processed in 30 seconds

18031357
std	ostream
this is even stranger if you consider that after the creation i can just use this buffer and share a common buffer with other buffers with copyfmt so there is no real need for my std ostream to be initialized to something right from the creation of the object to be useful

18031371
box-sizing	border-box
your savior is called box-sizing border-box

18031375
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
firefox 29 google-chrome 10 safari 5.1 and internet explorer 8 onwards all support box-sizing unprefixed however there are a few known issues from particular versions

18031375
height	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
ie8 ignores box-sizing border-box if min max-width height is used

18031375
box-sizing	border-box
ie8 the min-width property applies to content-box even if box-sizing is set to border-box

18031376
versioning	upgrade
you should probably upgrade your versioning of android annotations

18031406
std	ostream
std ostream is conceptually abstract - you re not supposed to create them but see other answers for more detail on that

18031406
std	ostream
std stringstream gives you everything std ostream does because it derives from it

18031468
int	chars
javascript sort an array a certain way with int and chars

18031480
hash	md5
i m using to hash a password using md5 programatically but when i compared md5 hash created in c# and md5 hash created by an sql server hashbytes md5 admin the result is not same

18031485
std	ostream
the std ostream is a generalized stream class

18031485
std	ostream
create the buffer of your wanted type first and then create the a generalized std ostream with the buffer as a parameter

18031487
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this does not happen on windows firefox ie google-chrome and mostly happens on os x firefox safari google-chrome

18031526
folder	directory
if you get this exception even when you are sure that you have included all the jars then create a libs folder in the project root directory and copy all jars in libs folder

18031549
cydia	tweak
exactly like this cydia lockscreen tweak

18031569
folder	directory
if you get this exception even when you are sure that you have included all the jars then create a libs folder in the project root directory and copy all jars in libs folder

18031574
super	abstract
you can define an abstract super class client with 3 properties shared among all of them

18031586
google-chrome	firefox
always remember when you encounter problems related to width check dimensions of element through box model from firefox developer tool or from google-chrome s metrix box

18031586
width	margin
if a element is made display inline it won t take width margin padding values and if it is displayed as inline-block it take width margin padding

18031593
children	parent
this should leave the related_task_ids in the parent task but not store the nil_ids on the children

18031626
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade the spring versioning to 3.2.0.release

18031629
width	height
my preference is to give the image a large width and height say double of the width and height i want it to appear on screen and then save the image at a fairly low quality

18031648
hide	show
so click event hide then mouseenter show again

18031648
google-chrome	firefox
but if you disable mouseenter event of img in a short duration the problem will be solved in google-chrome and firefox

18031649
google-chrome	firefox
if you use pixels in google-chrome or firefox it works fine even if you use all percentages but set the parent div width using pixels it will work

18031649
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
fiddle example view this in safari and firefox google-chrome to see that safari renders #pixels just the same as #percents is and should be rendered in both

18031649
width	height
my workaround fiddle uses a wrapper to avoid having to compute the top+margins the inner div that uses 80 width height

18031663
sudo	passwd
sudo is most likely prompting for the passwd of the administrator

18031663
pop-up	dialog
i can remember a gksudo instead that would pop-up a dialog and lets you enter the password

18031665
post	get
am able to edit the data but how to get that data inorder to post it and update database in codeigniter

18031703
std	ostream	ostream	istream
std istream and std ostream i would expect only the most

18031703
std	ostream
streambuf to the constructor of std ostream but if you can t it s

18031735
std	ostream
if you really need an std ostream which isn t set up to do anything yet you can use that constructor

18031735
std	ostream
this std ostream will have the std ios_base badbit set until a stream buffer is set up using std ios rdbuf

18031735
std	ostream
the underlying reason for std ostream s default constructor being protected is that it actually deliberately doesn t do anything useful

18031735
std	ostream	ostream	istream
the reason for this odd behavior is that constructing an object of the further derived class std iostream would initialized the std ios object twice once through std ostream and once through std istream

18031735
std	ostream
unlike some of the other answers suggest std ostream isn t abstract at all

18031821
listview	gridview
if you have to show some extra information along with your pictures than you may consider using listview gridview

18031847
picturebox	datarepeater
i think easiest way to dynamically create picturebox is datarepeater which you can find under visual basic powerpacks node in toolbox

18031847
picturebox	datarepeater
then place picturebox and label on datarepeater which you just added

18031848
ant	maven
also i think it could be done using ant task and call weblogic.deployer anyway maven plugin and wlst call weblogic deployer application - it s just are wrappers

18031863
maven	pom.xml
jedis is available from maven central so try adding the following to your pom.xml

18031867
hash	md5
client takes the string appends it to the username and then appends a secret string hard coded in the app and uses md5 to hash the entire string

18031867
hash	md5
server generates the same md5 hash string and if they match marks this user as authenticated in the database and all api requests from this user will be handled from now on

18031896
folder	directory
here you core name is collection1 and directory pointing to collection1 folder

18031947
put	get
get your db data in a list or a map and put the list in reverse order in your listview adapter

18032002
pull	push
adding a remote tracking branch means that git then knows what you want to do when you git fetch git pull or git push in future

18032014
pull	push
this sets the upstream association for any future push pull attempts automatically

18032054
post	get
you may try the follow to get the post date

18032111
superclass	subclassing
one x belongs to the superclass and the other to the subclassing

18032248
expander	grid
i used expander to show few items in devexpress dockpanel but as i clicked it it showed half part of a grid

18032252
free	realloc
all in short you manage dynamic memory with other tools that the language provides sizeof realloc free etc

18032277
superclass	subclassing
according to this tutorial in section what you can do in a subclassing when you declare a field in the subclassing with the same name as the one in the superclass in this case x the one in the superclass will be hidden which means that there re actually two x s in the subclassing one for itself the other for its superclass only baring the same name x

18032320
qplaintextedit	qtextedit
you just need to reimplement qplaintextedit or qtextedit with your own class that inherits from it and override the keypressevent

18032326
src	attr
we are using the attr short for attribute to change the src attribute

18032354
post	get
i recommend you get familiar with your browsers development tools as they will quite probably help you find out all of this for yourself without you needing to post your code on the internet

18032366
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in google-chrome 28 and firefox 22

18032372
multiplying	add
then i am creating radio group having four radio buttons add sub multiplying divide

18032430
post	get
i m trying to post xml to my tomcat server from an android device but i get zero bytes in the stream

18032438
width	height
i have tried chaging the height and width in the #slider1 .viewport class but no luck

18032440
width	height
what you could do is cheat a little bit by setting width and height to 0 to hide the actual image and apply some css to do what you want

18032441
post	get
as long it gets a class type in action parameter it would try to map the post body content or get querystring parameters to your custom class properties

18032499
hash	md5
this will use md5 hash password transfer and is perfectly secure

18032530
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
uppercase urls are problematic because cookie paths are case-sensitive most of the internet is actually case-sensitive while microsoft technologies treats urls as case-insensitive

18032622
division	subtraction
this approach will also work for finding the sum of a range of numbers or any operation for which an inverse operation also exists for sum the inverse is subtraction for products the inverse is division

18032622
min	max
it wouldn t work for operations like max or min

18032673
width	height
this is not helpful and there s little that can be done about this unless the containing block has a known and fixed aspect ratio in which case you could calculate the percentage value of the height needed from the width and the aspect ratio

18032789
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i checked in firefox google-chrome ie9 safari

18032789
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
see this image getting same in google-chrome firefox ie9 and safari

18032801
versioning	upgrade
but if you re just getting started i recommend you simply upgrade your ruby versioning rather than rewriting your code

18032811
int	chars
the first is variable for point it means p is a point which points to a chars so int p is a point which points to a int value this is variable for point

18032814
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your graphics driver to the latest versioning and hope that the manufacturer has developed that extensions

18032844
inherited	properties
this properties is inherited from the displayobject class

18032844
getter	setter
the property is a string and you set or retrieve it from its setter getter implementations in displayobject

18032853
pull	push
if your developers only need to clone the repo once and then they push pull changes the bandwidth concern is mitigated

18032865
rss	feed
first put an id or class to your div in which you are putting or showing your rss feed like

18032888
getter	setter
note that there are different getter and setter for different types of variables

18032894
ready	each
the good stuff is happening in the jquery block of code because you can see that when the document is ready we are going through all the galleries by selecting them with div.gallery and then we are looping through each of them to find the .attachment-thumbnail class which is given to the thumb for the wordpress gallery and we are targeting the s parent which happens to be the tag and adding that class you wanted called .view

18032923
mouseleave	mouseenter
notice that in 1.4.2 the hover sets mouseleave to same as mouseenter when not specified

18032955
packets	pcap
i am working with pcap in an os x application to understand packets analysis

here is my mousedown mouseup mousemove and paint methods

18033154
put	get

18033212
width	height
what i have done is add a div for each body peace and give them the same width height position etc

18033229
rss	feed
it seems that firefox is unaware of the rss extension content encoded in firefox rss feed using full text displays as excerpt apparently unreported in bugzilla

18033239
cos	sin
the time isn t spent in loops it ll be spent in the math functions sin and cos

18033248
bluetooth	usb
the far more common scenario today is a bluetooth or usb driver that emulates a serial port

18033323
integer	unsigned
now if that computer is standard you get a lot of information like maximum ram capacity maximum unsigned signed integer value and so on.

18033378
integer	unsigned
the typedef name uint n _t designates an unsigned integer type with

18033378
integer	unsigned
thus uint24_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width

18033404
button	checkbox
in my app the style of button and checkbox changed

18033411
unsigned	short
you have this value stored in a unsigned short ushortvar in your program

18033446
pecl	pear
i discovered that the problem was that mamp really hadn t been set up to add extensions in general and during the compilation of the mongo php drivers it wasn t installing it in the right place -- so i followed the following tutorial on preparing mamp for additional pecl and pear extensions

18033454
put	get
i am trying to find out how to send data from any source and have that data get put into its respective columns - address date etc

18033499
width	height
i am thinking of making it work like colorbox when the content of the modal changes it changes its width and height depending on the contents dimensions

18033500
width	height
this will ensure that the height and width are available to the js in order that the margins can be calculated correctly

18033503
tablet	galaxy
works on galaxy s3 xperia s nexus 4 phones and nexus 7 tablet

18033505
int	chars
for instance joins are very fast if int is used and can be fast enough if using numeric but i wouldn t recommend it for varchar chars varying

18033516
opus	speex
i had heard about the opus silk g.722 speex but don t know which one should i use to get the better quality and less file size

18033532
glibc	newlib	libc	newlib
on linux libc like glibc eglibc or newlib implement ptmalloc or a variant of ptmalloc

18033534
onmouseover	onclick
i know onmouseover works because i have tested using the same jquery i use to scroll to the top of the page onclick

i would want that the user would be alerted after clicking the submit button if the user leaves a textbox empty and prevent the button from submission and entering the action from form so that the user can enter their inputs before entering to the php code

18033763

post	get
it s really easy to get images out of post with already created function get_item_tags which allows you to browse simplepie s parsed output

18034408
put	get
if you want to get more images just put in foreach and get out the links

18034447
getter	setter
depending on the context the use of getter and setter is actually a bigger violation of encapsulation than using member variables in constructors

18034447
superclass	subclassing
one warning is that the use of setname within the constructor might call an overrided method in a subclassing which may not be what you want since it may leave name undefined in the superclass

18034457
int	chars
may be you can store a digit of your int by chars .initialized them like

18034480

you ll notice the getter setter is final in the above example

18034494
devise	cancan
i m using rails 4 with devise cancan and rollify

18034497
imagemagick	mogrify
using imagemagick you need only two mogrify passes one to enlarge the ones smaller than your required minimum and one to shrink the ones that are larger than the maximum

18034497

folder	directory
but if i check the tmp -folder there is no such directory and all subsequent write or read operations on the folder fail because the folder does not exist

18034797
777	tmp
the permissions for tmp are correct root root with 777 and i can do sudo -u http mkdir -p tmp test without problems

18034797
folder	directory
if i use tmp test for example the code will run fine and create a folder within the directory of the php-skript which lies in a folder which belongs to me not the http-user .

18034817

i m successfully displaying a photo in firefox version 22 -- in two different img tags -- one of the img tags has no css width or height set and so the image appears in its original size

18034949
punctuation	words
here punctuation are also read as words is separated by spaces you need to remove them from vector

18034952
trie	tree
the idea is that at each node of your trie you store all the words that have the corresponding prefix along with their priorities in a self-balancing binary search tree ordered according to priority

18034952
trie	tree
when a word gets priority +1 you have to go up through the trie and update the balanced binary search tree for the corresponding trie node for the word and all its parent nodes which takes o l log n time

18034952
trie	tree
a word of length l is stored in l binary tree the tree at the trie node for your word and also the tree for all its l-1 parent nodes

18034952
trie	tree
so if you add up the total storage for all tree at all nodes in the trie by counting in terms of how many times each word occurs in your tree the total tree storage is linear in the total length of all your words which is o n l_avg

18034958
int	double
to solve your question for now cast either value to a float or double and cast result back to int

18034987

developers are encouraged to start using either the mysqli or pdo extension now so that when that happens you don t find yourself unable to upgrade php versioning without rewriting all your code

18035016
width	height
text width 2 height 2 square

18035035

i can t see why it would need one and even if i put one still get a compile error

18035123
switching	screens
i need to dispose of everything on the screens before switching

18035142
qmainwindow	qdialog
i think because the designer in qt creator created a qmainwindow not a qdialog

however i do feel like there has to be something important about that url generated right after the get post delete box in the graph api explorer

18035197
post	get
in the result of analysis by developer tools post and get works at the same time

18035218
move	drag	mousemove	mousedown
if i got you right this will draw an ellipse with center as the point where mousedown caught while you drag the mouse in mouse move event to expand or not the ellipse it will be centered at the point caught by mousedown location.about the radious it will be in the picturebox in the code inside mousemove event i placed the 2 variables xdiff and ydiff to get the job done and also it shows their values in the form caption always updating as you move and their values are the radious of x and y because note you might draw an oval ellipse

18035296
listview	gridview
the listview and adapter work fine and the gridview expands fine when added but i cannot get it to display more than a single row in the grid

18035303
superclass	subclassing
usually if the superclass implements serializable it s subclassing are serializable as well.this is the only situation when you can make fields transient and the class does t implements serializable directly but apart of this if the class is not serializable it makes no sense to make them transient

18035305
hash	md5
this indicates that it is an md5 hash

18035305
hash	salt
after that is the hash password which was hash using the salt - in this case puhl00ks5uy3cmvaic0 g0

18035305
hash	salt
now you can use openssl to hash the given password using the same salt like so

18035305
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
enter the given password when prompted the openssl command should compute the md5 hash using the salt provided and it should be exactly the same as the above from the shadow file

18035334
mouseleave	mouseenter
it adds event listeners for mouseenter and mouseleave to the rows following a row with the rowspan attribute set

18035339

18035568
width	height
i just want to add 20px more on the width if the height of the image is higher than the maxheight value

18035614
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
since you are using viewcontroller by adding it subview of scrollview by adding viewcontroller this way viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear will be called only once i mean there is no use of viewwillappear here as such rather if you want to update anything in the added viewcontroller you should create a public class in viewcontroller and call it when you need an update

18035623
width	height
which is another method i used for a client s website and using a 1800px wide image which renders nicely for large as well as small iphone screens and will automatically adjust to screen width without worrying about height attribute

18035632
daemons	systemd
this section says that user instance of systemd daemons is run

18035634

18035639
int	double
variables with variable types int double string array

18035641
for-loop	loops
you could either loops over the object with a for-loop or turn the result into a list by calling list on it

18035713
mouseover	mouseout
but in this code below javascript only the mouseover and mouseout work fine

18035747
for-loop	loops
your problem is that the variable i from the outer for-loop isn t captured properly by the event because by time the event is evaluated loops already finished and the variable is at it s last value

18035775
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
this is because observablecollection implements the inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged interfaces by default and so when something in the collection changes it s fires an event that tells the ui control to update

18035789
g++	gcc
the equivalents of gcc and g++ are clang and clang++ accordingly

18035808

18035890
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
usercontrol contains dropdownlistfor s textbox and checkbox

18035910
hide	show
if you notice the navigation auto hide itself when you scroll down however when you scroll up it would show it self again

18035950
metaclass	subclassing
most metaclass subclassing type

18035950
metaclass	subclassing
which should have been what you would have expected since this is how defining attributes of classes works in python. you can also override __mro__ when you are subclassing type to create a metaclass

18035950
inherited	subclassing	metaclass	subclassing
if you are creating a metaclass that isn t a subclassing of type and that isn t a function that returns an instance of type presumably you already know exactly what you are doing well enough that you aren t worrying about this but __mro__ would not be inherited since your not subclassing type

18035974
express	node.js

18036303
express	node.js
i have this app.get in my node.js express server

18036308
multiplying	multiplication
the question why does this happen only when multiplying with 100 even though there is a precise representation for 110.0 is still unanswered but i suppose there is no simple answer other than fully stepping through a floating-point multiplication

18036308
multiplying	multiplication
when you multiplying it by 10 100 1000 and a few more powers of ten you multiplying by a number n that is exactly representable as a double with the additional property that the result of the real multiplication 1.1 n is exactly representable as a double too

18036579
ubuntu	linux
based on your lack of experience with gnu linux i would suggest you use desktop ubuntu

18036603
int	double
if it s an array values inside then you have to save in nsarray if it s a dictionary values inside then save as nsdictionary and if you have single values like string int double then you have to save them using appropriate objective-c data types

the value of i when not defined is usually very random but it can have the integer max value so incrementing it once actually makes it turn to the initger minimum value

18036814
width	margin
you need to have a the input be box padding + input margin + button margin + button width

18036859
int	chars
you can take the input as chars and use atoi to convert them to int

18036875
int	chars
if the value p being boxed is true false a byte or a chars in the range u0000 to u007f or an int or short number between -128 and 127 inclusive then let r 1 and r 2 be the results of any two boxing conversions of p

18036875
int	chars
less memory-limited implementations might for example cache all chars and short values as well as int and long values in the range of -32k to +32k

18036908
fflush	gets
what you can do is output the page and fflush it so all data gets sent to the user

q_object is not a properties it is a macro so it is cannot be inherited

18037496
dictionary	map
the syntax error the method newframework map in the type frameworkfactory is not applicable for the arguments dictionary

18037523
int	boolean
a call to the function is a boolean expression just like a call to a function that returns an int is an int expression

18037523
division	addition
like any other operator + for addition for division etc. it takes one or more operands of some type s and yields a result of some type

18037523
int	boolean
any scalar int floating-point or pointer expression can be used in a boolean context if while etc. treated as false if it s equal to 0 and true otherwise

18037523
int	boolean
when was added to the language along with the type _bool and the macros false and true it was done in a way that makes it convenient to write code that uses the new built-in boolean type without breaking existing code that uses int or other scalar types for boolean values and operations.

18037564
post	put
i have the following code it is to post a message into the chatbox but when i put return false

18037618
hide	show
when the logic actually does work the dialog is show hide properly

18037618
hide	show
if the logic does nothing and the signals are just emitted sequentially the dialog doesn t always show hide properly

18037618
hide	show
i tried using a member qmutex in the dialog logic whenever i called either show or hide but this didn t work

18037637
oncreate	recreate
i think the issue is that the adapter variable that the download uses to bind to to show updates is recreate in the oncreate method of the activity and the adapter variable that the download originally bound to is not in the activity anymore

18037665
hide	show
my guess is that the problem occurs because show and hide calls interlace

18037665
hide	show
to verify this use a semaphore - lock the object until show have finished and wait on it in hide

because the navigation menu takes up 211px of the screen width the container when centered using margin 0 auto overlaps with the menu

18038472
margin	height
then make them move them up 1 4th the height of container to bring them in center vertically by giving them negative margin

18038479

because in this case the width height of our body is always 100 of the window width height if you want your code to be easily adaptable to modals etc. you can always use position absolute as without any context this will be relative to the body

18044832
width	height
criteria 2 - the layout should support a multitude of ways to describe width and height

18044832
box-sizing	border-box
the first thing to note is that the only change i ve had to do is add a box-sizing border-box to each of our elements

google-chrome	firefox
since we re making a web erp system for a specific company they decided to force their employees to use google-chrome or firefox

18045952
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
this works because bsxfun will automatically perform the operation add on every dimension where one arrays has a singleton dimension while the other arrays has a non-singleton dimension - in effect performing the for loops without needing a for-loop

18045958

first make sure the inner function is running at all so try setting the function to onreadystatechange instead of onload

18046071
getter	setter
i know i can write bunch of getter and setter but say i had 10+ properties it feels like a lot of boilerplate

18046088
mutators	getter
then you create getter and mutators

18046095
getter	setter
you should write getter and setter

18046095
getter	setter
another advantage of using a getter or setter can be doing some checks or preprocessing before returning or setting the field

18046102
getter	setter
you should do getter and setter for each

18046131
inherited	subclassing
you can now create an iterator over any subclassing of positivenumber but since that class inherited from positivenumber it must also inherited the interface

18046166
getter	setter
it s better to have getter setter to return the fields so that you can encapsulate the way the fields are calculated

18046166
getter	setter
and the only way in java to change field behavior without potentially changing tons of code or worse requiring your api users to change bunches of code is to use getter and setter

18046185
inherited	subclassing
it seems it is due to these attributes not being declared as inherited and i was using them with a subclassing of nestedtree hence the issue

18046211
width	height
it takes a command get or set and a parameter to access width height etc.

18046232

i thought of using fminsearch to solve this minimization problem but from mathworks i get that functions which are suitable inputs for fminsearch are defined like this an example

18046543
multiplying	multiplication
thus due to multiplication distributivity multiplying by is the same as shifting to the left by u1 u2 .

18046543

18049953
nfa	dfa
in theory regular expression nfa and dfa are equivalent which means they have exactly the same ability to describe languages sequences of characters

18049970
getter	setter
i often use both approaches having getter and setter and not

18049970
getter	setter
i always use private fields which force the use of getter and setter in my model

18049970
getter	setter
then for my dtos which are normally used for things like restful services i use mostly public fields with no getter and setter

18049970
getter	setter
these dtos have no logic and get marshaled out to json or created from json that s being set from a client so i find no need for the getter and setter

18049970

18060771
ubuntu	linux
they are both located on the same machine running ubuntu linux 12.04 lts

18060829
maven	pom.xml
the other alternative is that your project inherits from a maven pom.xml which configures surefire to use forkmode always which will spawn a new jvm for each test class

18060842

18061073
int	chars
build a union with long int and an array of 8 unsigned chars and see for yourself

18061107
folder	directory
code posts.php is an absolute path so unless you have a folder called code in your base directory it can t find the file

18061123
min	max
there might be a simpler way but this generates four buckets of ids and you could plug the min and max values into your parametrized filter condition

18061123
min	max
and then pass each min max to a sql script from a shell script calling sql plus

18061129
mouseleave	mouseenter
hover hover actually works with mouseenter and mouseleave without firing for children

pbkdf2	salt
you treat that as a password salt it with mygreatservice and run it through pbkdf2

18061432
post	get
the issue with configuring the module database is probably a different issue and you would have to post your module database configuration to get help there

18061436
inherited	properties
apparently the inherited properties comes from the microsoft.cpp

18061436
inherited	properties
follow the instructions in that link for finding the properties sheets inherited by your project and you can modify them to get rid of the -zi flag

18061436
inherited	properties
third idea try to change the default location of the inherited properties sheets to somewhere i can control

18061436
inherited	properties
the windows environment variable userrootdir specifies the location of the inherited properties sheets

18061439
hash	salt
i m comfortable with the way the application passwords are stored and verified salt and hash with many iterations the issue is that the authentication process is slow and cpu hungry which it is supposed to be

18061439
hash	salt
username + hash salt + password

18061445
uiview	subviews
i ve got a uiview superview that has a couple of uilabels as subviews set up in interface builder

18061453
plot	errorbar
it also occurs if the errorbar are hitting the limits of the plot

18061494
maven	m2e
another way is to try right click maven maven update if you use m2e and check force updating release

18061517
put	get
when i put in my codefusion code in wwwwroot folder and go to localhost to test my website i get unable to load library null

18061521
put	get	datediff	difference
the simplest way assuming sql server is probably to use datediff to get the difference in seconds and put the calculations inside a common table expression

18061526
int	chars
the routine is doing a combination of reading in chars values and converting them to an int value in the same operation to be fast apparently

18061547
multiplying	multiplication
the code is written like this in the belief that a shifts and adds are significantly faster than multiplication and b the compiler doesn t know the best way to multiplying by ten

18061599
put	get
now when i try to put an element in said cache outside of a transaction i get

18061605
width	height
the edittext backgrounds are now drawing to the full height width of the screen

18061643

you can then get a file folder list for that directory

18061995
submit	submission
submission of the form loads the next one this will go on for about 10 pages before finally sending the user to a generic data capture form where they will submit their credentials for inclusion in a prize draw

min	max
i also include sample emails in the final results the min and max which allow you to see samples for each group

18062070
qmainwindow	qwidget
and for qwidget the parent should also be a qwidget so in your case you d want to make w as the parent of all your qmainwindow s

18062070
qmainwindow	qdialog
ps the child windows are shown as toplevel windows and not inside the w window because qmainwindow and qdialog has the qt window flag set by default

18062078
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian it is located in directory usr lib jvm java-xxxxx lib tools.jar

18062103
getter	setter
the error means that correct getter and setter could not be located for your property

18062103
getter	setter
the correct syntax for your getter and setter should be

18062103
getter	setter
if you are not sure- always use code generation for your getter and setter

18062103
getter	setter
if you are interested in the specific convention your getter and setter will relate to tid not tid

18062106
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
however this solution works with relative sizes and seems to work in latest google-chrome ie firefox and safari

18062107
dynatree	fancytree
as the existing data does not have the correct fieldnames i need to be able to create a new array with correct fieldnames that the dynatree fancytree plugin can use

18062107
dynatree	fancytree
dynatree fancytree requires among other things an id and a name

18062130
ienumerable	iqueryable
convert list to ienumerable or iqueryable add using system.linq.dynamic namespace then u can mention the property names in comma seperated string to orderby method which comes by default from system.linq.dynamic

18062137
post	get
this allows you to do a get to that page instead of having to post a complete object

18062256
min	max
it even works better with random sleep between min and max

18062275
submit	submission
so a high priority client system for sales will submit all messages with 5 delivery attempts retries and 15 minutes between each attempt whereas a low priority client system back-end mail shot system will allow users to update their marketing preferences submission messages with 3 retries and an hour between each attempt

18062301
hide	show
tap the editor again the keyboard will hide and an alert view will show

18062364
dumpsys	adb
i tried to understand the numbers given by adb shell dumpsys meminfo but i don t know if that would be a great start.

18062380
opera	google-chrome
i just ran some random tests on my code and was shocked to discover that get_browser read opera as google-chrome

18062380
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
a few months ago get_browser gave me correct results on all 5 browsers google-chrome ie firefox opera safari

18062380
opera	google-chrome
today opera displayed the same values with google-chrome

18062380
opera	google-chrome
i saw this javascript alternative which works but like get_browser it also detected opera as google-chrome

18062458
slideup	slidedown
an alternative using slidedown and slideup methods

18062500
hide	show
show collections hide some collections from view

18062516
post	get
like jeff mentioned in that post you can use the self module to get a url to your images in the data directory

18062573
hash	md5
you have to create an index on your md5 table - no matter if the hash are not unique - not having an index means a linear access throw all the records at each access

18062591
division	multiplication
please note that i dont want to use multiplication or division operators to do this

18062638
bower	npm
while the idea of using npm for both backend and frontend may sound temptingâ it certainly did to meâ try bower or ender.js instead for frontend dependencies

18062658
free	malloc
2 you need to free a malloc ed array a vla is an automatic variable and will not exist outside of the scope it is declared in

18062677
portrait	landscape
you can try to change several times between portrait landscape this restarts the activity

18062688
accessor	properties
an instance is identified by its attributes so you could write a method that checks for certain properties and then use it to determine if a certain object could access that properties accessor

18062726
vbscript	jscript
you could use powershell vbscript or jscript to easily do what you want

18062727
keydown	keyup
so you need to catch it in keydown or keyup events and set suppresskeypress property is true to prevent backspace key change your text in textbox

18062744
centos	linux
however when i run this on my linux centos 6.4 x64 box i get a org.hibernate.exception.constraintviolationexception because of the user1 value

18062748
button	checkbox
i know i can add button checkbox etc from designer

18062769
rss	feed
navigate to the blog site which is the source for the rss feed webpart

18062769
rss	feed
you may need to restart the outlook client accessing the rss feed to see the view change

18062778
hide	show
now i want to hide this from the user and instead show

18062783
hide	show
a simpler approach to this would be to use jquery and set a css class name on the cells of the column you want to show hide

18062788
put	get
line i put the cin.ignore function to get rid of the enter key pressed after inputing the sentence

18062799
min	max
assuming you set the min and max values to 0 and 32 respectively and the progress values using the setvalue method your progress bar will now show integers from 0 to 32

18062871
stdout	stderr
or you can redirect both stdout and stderr

18062886
mdpi	hdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi
android have a categorization of phone screens according to the dpi of the screens namely ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi tvdpi low med high xtra high tv respectively

18062940
armadillo	lapack
i m using the armadillo package for linear algebra with c++ which needs a couple of lapack and blas .dll s to function properly

18062963
opera	google-chrome
however differentiation of opera and google-chrome is still possible as opera appends its version to the user-agent as you can see above

18062996
bower	npm
if you install front-end dependencies through npm you can use a package bundling tool like bower to bundle all dependencies into one file

18063025
hide	show
i do want to say that it would be a muchhhhhhh better practice to just show and hide a div containing all those inputs rather than manipulating the dom to create destroy them constantly

18063035
uu-parsinglib	parsec
uu-parsinglib is definitely worth the time to explore but i would suggest that getting familiar with parsec first is the better course for these reasons

18063040
inherited	subclassing
for instance i ve made subclassing for uiviewcontroller of which all my other viewcontrollers inherited so i could use my code more optimal

18063080
.htaccess	httpd.conf
make sure mod_rewrite and .htaccess are enabled through httpd.conf and then above code is placed in your .htaccess under document_root directory

18063088
google-chrome	firefox
this also fixes the authentication problems that happen if you connect from google-chrome or firefox

18063105
put	get
in addition gordonlinoff makes an excellent suggestion - get comfortable with using the ansi join syntax which is both more expressive and more comprehensible than the old-style put all the conditions in the where clause and then try to puzzle it out style

18063120
switching	screens
when one long presses anywhere on the viewgroup which takes over the whole screens more specific a linearlayout it will trigger mode switching

18063122
width	height
the point is that as in ib the font is set to the default when i set my custom font programmatically it is not centered i guess because the font i can see in ib for the button has another height and width and this is the size considered to center the title

18063204
sorting	filtering
if you re doing something interactive sorting or filtering in the browser then you might still be able to get away with that strategy provided that

18063251
width	height
i got code from here and just changed it to height objectanimator animate linearlayout width

18063258
redhat	fedora
for centos fedora redhat systems

18063309
equals	icomparable
a run-time exception occurs as sql cannot work with anything but primitive types even if i implement icomparable and designate my own equals that compares a single field

18063313
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

18063397
post	get
you would get an ipn post for each transaction

18063397
post	get
if three of ten fail you would get ten ipn post

18063405
gson	jackson
it looks like jackson json has a configuration in which only maps will have their null values serialized but gson only appears to have serialization of all null values or none at all

18063417
decoder	encoder
you can use an html encoder decoder there are many available online

18063439
width	height
because document.width and document.height are undefined so your canvas width and height are 0 and 0

18063442
mocha	sinon
i could test the implementation of my callback function pretty much like this mocha + sinon

18063456
gridview	sqldatasource
since i m new to vb and asp i m using the sqldatasource to fill the gridview without vb code behind please note this everything is being shown in the aspx code

18063522
gruntjs	uglifyjs
i m trying to make sourcemaps to play nice while i m using gruntjs and uglifyjs gruntjs task

18063552
for-loop	arrays
i am using a for-loop to set source and destination indexes to copy items in an arrays

18063554
post	get
the comment should get credit for the answer but they did not post an answer

18063588
hide	show
basically you show the loading dialogue just before the ajax request then hide it after it has completed

18063593
put	get	post	get	post	put
otherwise if the name of the controller method starts with get post put delete head options or patch then by convention the action supports that http method

18063649
textarea	textbox
when it s displayed in a textbox or textarea it s automatically encoded to html entities

18063686
hide	show
i have a xsl form that i would like to toggle or show hide a section when a specific value is selected or present on the form

18063697
stdout	stderr
debugging shows the java app hangs reading the stderr inputstream which in turn causes the script process attempting to write more to stdout to become blocked

18063697
stdout	stderr
i think stderr is being written to second after stdout so it just waits until it sees input and it can t receive input because write is stuck on stdout

18063720
stdout	stderr
usually output goes either to file descriptor 1 stdout or 2 stderr

18063720
stdout	stderr
redirects stdout and stderr to a file named - hyphen which is not what what you want to do

18063720
stdout	stderr
it s easy to remember redirects stdout to descriptor 2 stderr redirects stdout to descriptor 3 and redirects stdout to a dead end it closes stdout

18063720
stdout	stderr
for output redirection to a file you can direct both stdout and stderr to the same place very concisely but only in bash

18063724
client-side	server-side
you re confusing server-side and client-side code

18063730
inherited	properties
but if you want to work like simple binding without relativesource first of all you need to get rid of explicitly setting datacontext and move all commands and properties in mainwindowsviewmodel so that your usercontrol inherited its datacontext from mainwindow

18063746
put	get	post	get	post	put
the difference is that the first action will only accept a request with the delete method while the second will accept a request with any method get post put delete head options or patch

18063761
sidekiq	celluloid
guess you should define a separate class including celluloid here s an example based on one of those from sidekiq repo

18063767
put	get
i can get the images to display and rotate by selecting the array manually like or but i don t know where to start with a click even reading the id of the link clicked and creating a variable that i can put in

18063771
width	height
i want to show some image thumbnails images are square in a gridview with these constraints that each row shows exactly two image and images fit the screen width except padding and margins but have a max width and height for example 1 inch

18063771
screens	tablet
first picture 4 inches cell phone is exactly what i want but as screens width grows tablet or landscape orientation like image 2 i want to enlarge the image items

18063814
width	height
edit btw i don t want to use width height 100 because i have an image inside the square that is fit like that so i really need to zoom

18063836
inherited	properties
because if someone decided to extend a class where i abuse constructors w o adding new properties and with single inherited it s a nightmare

18063836
inherited	properties
i also wonder why for c++11 they did not figure out that when i m extending a single class and not adding new properties it should inherited the parent s default behavior constructors assignment operators etc.

18063842
gif	png
i only want the user to see common image files like jpeg gif png

18063853
multiplying	add
you could multiplying a by 100.0 and perhaps add 0.5 for rounding and then take the int value of the result

18063865
pull	push
i have a repository on github.com that i git pull down to my workstation edit commit then git push the changes back to github

18063870
getter	setter
you don t need a getter setter for postdata the postdata items are being individually sent as request params so itemid is in the requestmap as itemid

18063870
getter	setter
add getter setter in your action class for all the items you are sending in your postdata

18063898
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
to me this says that internally the uinavigationcontroller repositions the uinavigationbar inside an animation block regardless of whether animating was specified in the call to setnavigationbarhidden animated

18063959
folder	directory
in my public folder i have a directory called admin where i put all the styles and scripts corresponding to the admin panel

the problem is that since i have that admin folder in my public directory laravel is ignoring the admin route i defined so i can t access the proper controller

18063991
ant	maven
alternatively you can use a build tool like ant or maven to generate the javadoc for you which have nice wrapped functions

18064027
folder	directory
i solved it copying the full folder in the new workspace using resource explorer then i started eclipse and create a new project with file general create project from existing source then i browsed to the new directory and selected the folder project

18064032
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it works correctly but in firefox after the object is set it shows as undefined in the directive

18064041
range	max
you ll note that the x3 will either be max value causing an outof range exception or the y range will start with a higher value ie y3 y4 and doesn t work in reverse or when i decrement it

18064049
getter	setter
you need to have getter and setter for viewmodel in order to retrieve the values from posted form

18064067
mouse	keyboard
well i dont think there is any other way and i see a bug feature request here reported specifically asking for this so i wouldnt think another way exists other than either using the mouse or using the keyboard to highlight the particular item of interest and using ctrl + shift + r to get the menu and pressing enter but like you mention this wouldnt work for something like r.id.foo

18064070
hide	show
i ran into this same exception when attempting to hide show a dynamicform or a vlayout that contained some plain gwt widgets.

18064070
hide	show
the page loaded fine but i ran into trouble when i tried to add some hide show interaction functionality.

18064125
public	protected
this should be public or protected so that it is accessible in the derived classes

18064162
hide	show
you assign a handler that checks if the option is checked and if it is show or hide the div

18064176
dlsym	dlopen

however if for example you run tcpdump or tshark or dumpcap or a capture-from-the-command-line wireshark and specify a small value with the -s n flag or specify a small value in the limit each packet to n bytes option in the wireshark gui then libpcap winpcap will be passed that value and will only supply the first n bytes of each packet to the program and the entire packet won t be saved

18065642
firefox	safari
safari does not share data with firefox even if both are installed on the same os x machine

18065642
firefox	safari
now there could be bugs in one or the other that might allow js to have unfettered access to the os filesystem and therefore allow a web site in safari to access firefox s data or vice versa but this is not really related to a csrf.c

18065642
firefox	safari
not really any more than safari having cookies and firefox having cookies are somehow tied

18065993
daemons	systemd
print screen itself is definitely not a syscall but the kernel daemons which gets key presses definitely causes a routine to execute that uses what you would call a syscall. i put that in quotes because printscreen probably causes a program to run which is already in kernel space which means there won t be any systemd calls to the kernel since you re already there unless the window manager actually runs at user space which isn t true for mac osx or windows and i m assuming for linux as well

18067103
stdout	stderr
â that the stderr data from the child process should be captured into the same file handle as for stdout

18067103
stdout	stderr
in other words if you want to log stdout and stderr together then yes you do need to do this

18067103
stdout	stderr
if you want to log just stdout or just stderr or to log them each separately then no you should not do this

18067103
stdout	stderr
from your batch line it sounds like you do want to mix stdout and stderr together in which case you re doing the right thing

18067103
stdout	stderr
if you just want it to append stdout and stderr to the same file the logger is using you can get the logger s file object and pass that

18067154
stdout	stderr
assuming that all you really want is the python equivalent of piping stdout and stderr to a file you can do

18067154
stdout	stderr

i have attempted doing this through setter getter and prototypes but the intricacies of these methods are not apparent and seem limited

18067418
post	get
method not allowed normally means that the service you re sending the request to is configured to forbid a certain request type post get options

18067418
post	get
since you re trying as far as i can tell to use the get method i d suggest trying using post

18067418
post	get
if you could post the entire error response you get using fiddler or whatever it would be helpful in case using post doesn t do the job

18067469
int	chars
rather than indexof or a this uses the int value of a chars less 65 to index into an array which contains the ordering data

18067478
post	put
obviously you would want to put this into some sort of post check such as

18067552
backtracking	greedy

unsigned short const

18067878
super	self
so both super and self are defined in +methods

18067878
super	self
3. again super calls the superclass version of allocwithzone but the self value passed to the method still points to a mygizmoclass and since allocwithzone returns an object of the receiver s class you get a mygizmoclass back

18067878
super	self
4. you can easily verify super is different to self

18067879
google-chrome	firefox
you should test this as i ve only tested it in one version of firefox and google-chrome but it seems to correctly detect whether disabled inputs support events dispatchevent throws an exception on a disabled input

18067893
backtracking	greedy
as the other answers point out is a possessive quantifier it matches the previous element as many times as possible just like a greedy quantifier but never backtracking

about the audio quality we give it a 8 5 for google-chrome but only a 5 5 to 6 for firefox

18075245
getter	setter	accessor	properties
because most accessor methods are implemented in similar ways properties eliminate the need to implement a getter and setter method for each properties exposed in the class

udp	tcp
maybe separating the service logic from the tcp and udp logic different classes and therefore different units would lead to more elegant design

18087716
portrait	landscape
when the screen is in portrait orientation the textview can display a different length of text to when running in landscape mode

18087716
portrait	landscape
the problem is the textview can potentially contain a different number of lines depending on whether it is landscape portrait small screen large screen etc

18087759
for-loop	loops
to start again and be sure you have seven instead of 6 or less you could replace your big first foreach loops with a for-loop that depends of the count of the array_result and the array_result would be array_result i instead of possible

18087770
children	parent
i was able to add features as children to initiatives by updating the parent field of the feature to point to the initiative add features to initiative as children php api

18087786
ienumerable	ilist
the albums property should be an ilist album rather than ienumerable album

18087867
translation	localization
i am not sure if the tool exists also for sql server 2012 but in 2008 r2 you have a menu entry in the program group for sql server called data import export 32bit translation from my localization hope to be near at the exact thing that could be used to port an ms access database to a sql server

18087867
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
for the code part connection string you could continue to use oledb changing only the connection string see here at www.connectionstrings.com but your best option is to change everything and use the classes in the namespace system.data.sqlclient like sqlconnection instead of oledbconnection sqlcommand instead of oledbcommand and so on..

18087891

18087983
put	get
if you need to grab values from the web page and put them into the iframe and are worried about cross-domain issues you can get values from the webpage and pass them through the chrome extension into your iframe

18087983
ng-app	ng-controller
if you don t want to use an iframe you can also check if the page has the ng-app directive and if so the code you insert the div has an ng-controller along with the angular code so it can piggy-back off of the main angular app

18088098
put	get	apache	nginx	post	get	post	put
i would try to put php into an http server like apache or nginx than use some python web client like requests to send an http get or http post to the php server that could get the data via _get or _post variables

18088216
waitpid	fork
i strongly suggest reading advanced linux programming or some other good books explaining a lot more than we can do in a few minutes about various syscalls 2 involved notably fork 2 pipe 2 dup2 2 execve 2 waitpid 2 and several others perhaps poll 2 for multiplexing to avoid deadlocks in circular pipes

mp4	webm
currently i am using vlc to stream but i can only get a flash stream to work but i would like to do flv mp4 and webm

this will increase lines of code to get the assocciated object post - postimage - image instead of post - image but keeps it easy to maintain and understand

18088375
int	chars
java has no unsigned numbers chars is 16bit unsigned but it s not a number and math with chars will always result in implicit casts to int

18088375
unsigned	short
if you read 2 bytes of unsigned data into a short and want to see values in range from 0-65535 instead of -32768 - 32767 you ll have to use a type that can have values in that range

18088375
int	chars
since you happen to have 16bit values you can use chars and simply cast it to int

18088398
puts	gets
i m using the system.net.http.httpclient to send this request which i ve successfully used to send various other web requests gets posts and puts

18088833
draggable	droppable
i ve been experimenting with the jquery ui draggable droppable interaction to allow a user to set ships for a game of battleship

18088833

18088857
portrait	landscape
and it keeps displaying it on top of the window in portrait and in the left-bottom corner in landscape

18088907
ivar	subclassing
your class superviewcontroller does have an ivar _tableview but it is private so your subclassing can t use it

18088907
ivar	subclassing
if you need an ivar that subclassing can use you ll need to declare that ivar explicitly and make it something other than private

18089162
min	max
i have used min and max functions for getting random

18089228
apache	nginx
when i view the urls that git requests over http in firefox i notice that the communication is nothing else but text so i m pretty sure you could catch git requests per php in apache or nginx and run a authorization system like that that relays these git requests to the git backend

18089257
public	protected
if you forget this line the framework will search a next line and it will match the line that says by default all the url are public so the esi will be displayed even if it should be only included by a protected admin page for example .

18089296
apache	nginx
this might be better handled by nginx or apache

18089296
apache	nginx
for example requests for static assets are often handled by nginx apache directly

18089296
apache	nginx
this might be obvious but an additional advantage of handling rate limits in nginx apache is that requests over the limit don t even go into your rails processes

18089296
apache	nginx
nginx apache will cut them off immediately potentially saving some cpu.

18089319

18096673
rspec	capybara	post	get
in case you weren t i had the same problem as you today and was able to get the tests to pass by making two changes to the tests - passing a user hash when posting and using the no_capybara option on the sign_in method since get and post are not capybara methods and i think rspec doesn t behave as we might expect if we switch from capybara to non-capybara methods within the same test

18096693
innodb	myisam
it also depends on whether you re using myisam or innodb

18096714
serializable	deserialization
but the nullpointerexception you get during deserialization seems suspicious to me jackson should ideally be able to handle null values in the serializable output

18096741
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
had some problem embedding the content view uiviewcontroller correctly to the uinavigationcontroller because i tried to add the navigation bar items buttons each time directly to the uinavigationcontroller s navigationitem property

18096763
hide	show
i think it is a common sense that providing a simple way to hide show and enable disable a button but i cannot find any document that describe dojo has done such thing

18096786
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
you can create a proxy class using wsdl utility or svcutil.exe in visualstudiocommand prompt enter command wsdl.exe out path and name of the file language cs

tostring	gethashcode
just to auto implement things for them so for example provide a default implementation of gethashcode or maybe tostring

18097062
inherited	properties
abstract classes at all are more of a logic class to inherited from rather than use it as basic for inherited you can use abstract class to tell all who inherited from it to have a certain properties or a specific method to do

18097062
inherited	properties
lets say i have a mammal class but a mammal class is just an abstract class there is no real animal that is of a kind of a mammal although there are many animals including humans that inherited properties from it

for-loop	arrays
when i enter data i take these attributes for attribute entity in two different arrays and save them in go on clicking save button using a for-loop

18097468
width	height
as you can see it takes the video width and height of the video it calculates the ratio then it takes the displays height and makes a ratio to see how much bigger or smaller the video is than the screen then it creates the params for the video with that ratio and sets this parameters on the textureview

18097468
width	height
now if i keep it like this the video is stretched and even though it looks like its a rectangle a part from the top and bottom of the video disappear being 1 1 the width and height are the same and the height is bigger that the screen

18097468
width	height
now if i don t use the ratio and create the parameters with the width and height of the video 640 x 480 it will be a small square

18097523
apache	nginx
basically middleman compiles your static assets which you can then send to a cdn or basic web server such as apache or nginx

18097608
postgresql	mysql
i don t think it s a problem to do a daily comparison of 2 3-4m indexed tables in any rdbms oracle sql server mysql postgresql for that matter and it wouldn t take too long too

18097617
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i ve got a nested for-loop in the inner loops i ve got an arrays that will change size and value in each iteration e.g

18097660
goto	break
for the longest time goto has been frowned upon when you use goto in break the structure creates multiple exit points in code which from a theoretical point is really bad

18097670
libc	tcmalloc
redis support 3 memory allocator libc jemalloc tcmalloc

18097680
folder	directory
now i need to get the simulation folder and all the files in it recursively at the time of commit 022f5fb to the current working directory

hibernate will handle generating the sql for you fyi it uses cross joins by default for one-to-many and many-to-one relationships although you can set it to generate serial selects instead if you want

18098143
getter	setter
more importantly setter and getter for any field should also be present otherwise you will get a run time exception until and unless you are using custom getter and setter method approach same is missing in your class a

18098179
children	parent
reading into this the qgraphicsitem uses the itemignoretransformations flag based on its parent which in your case is the qgraphicsgroup but this class ignores the flag on its children which is likely to be causing the issue you re seeing

18098179
children	parent
therefore do not set the flag on the parent group but on its children

18098258
ubuntu	linux
i am running a 64bit ubuntu linux server on which i installed lamp stack and had problem with libcurl not having ssl support while the os binary does have ssl support

18098376
int	chars
it s because in c when you are reading chars as int scanf d choice

18098376
subtract	add
it takes the ascii code of the characters for example a 97 b 98 c 99 d 100 if you want to read a as 1 b as 2 etc you will have to add some extra code that tells the programme if the number is equal to the ascii code of a b c d or e subtract it with 96 so you get 1 2 3

18098416
capitalize	substr
regular expression here catches substr from the begining of the previous word to the first letter of the new one which should be capitalize

18098416
for-loop	arrays
the difference is that my version uses arrays operations instead of for-loop and uses filter to handle strings with bad character at the beginning or at the and of it

18098421
strstr	strcmp	strstr	strtok	strtok	strcmp
i am mapping text files with a lot of data in them and i have to use the pointer pbuf in a strstr strcmp strtok and other functions but the pbuf doesn t have a null terminating character at the end of it and it gives me access violation every time i use it in a function

18098424
spaces	delimiter
i have a string which gets exploded into an array using the spaces as a delimiter

18098436
disk	ram
the space is managed automatically by couchbase that removes after data has been persisted on disk data from the ram when necessary

18098441
silverstripe	modx
i have never heard of modx but can say for certain that silverstripe is the most user friendly cms i have seen so far

18098460
getter	setter
note that you should check for the presence of a setter in dest and for a getter in source but it s probably better to do it in the sourcemembers.select .

18098552
getter	setter
as time passes and i come to understand this issue better it appears the only issue is with the getter and setter generated by doctrine s cli tool as they break the type hinting contracts as mentioned below

18098552
getter	setter
generating getter and setter

18098552
getter	setter
next i generate the getter and setter by executing

18098552
getter	setter
ideally i d love to be able to execute the doctrine console commands to generate entity stubs and getter and setter without manual intervention to fix up type hints in sub-classes

18098566
profiling	instrumentation
after profiling it with instrumentation it shows that cost 93 time

18098585
nunit	moq
i am new to moq but am using it with nunit for unit testing

a similar restriction on shadowing of members by local variables was judged impractical because the addition of a member in a superclass could cause subclassing to have to rename local variables

18098636
soaplib	suds
after some reading i decided to use suds client and soaplib server

18098636
soaplib	suds
i m using python2.7 and i ve installed suds and soaplib by using easy_install so it s rather default combination of programs

suppose that you have a query and you know exactly how many results it will return and length of every column 1m records int id chars 100 uid

18098925
clearance	devise
when you have your user authenticated with devise or clearance the signed in user is available through the current_user method

18098933
libc	tcmalloc
generally you will have less fragmentation with jemalloc or tcmalloc than with libc malloc

18098933
libc	tcmalloc
with jemalloc and tcmalloc or with the bsd libc malloc there is no such

18098933
glibc	tcmalloc
jemalloc and tcmalloc with some setting changes can be more aggressive than glibc to release memory to the os - but again it depends on the allocation patterns

18098933
libc	tcmalloc
now if more memory is allocated with libc compared to jemalloc tcmalloc or if more memory is used by some other processes on your system during your benchmarks redis memory may be swapped out by the os

18098962
width	height
you can bind width and height to the video resolution like this

18099090
getter	setter
for that you need create variable of list.the setter getter methods for this list variable are as below

18099128
width	height
so for the actual expansion you would have to animate change the left top position together with width and height of the box

18099136
accessor	properties
you can also use an accessor properties to return the instance

18099145
width	height
i have a list of thumbnail images which when you resize the browser screen they all adapt nicely and keep the same height and width

18099147
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that contains and not a bunch of filenames delimiter by spaces

18099205
folder	directory
you need a js folder in the same directory as your web-inf folder and that is where you place them

18099215
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
can you confirm that no unchecked-exception such as a runtimeexception nullpointer etc. is thrown in any of your underlying methods - might even come from some custom validator

18099224
x86	64bit
this compiles and works as expected under linux 32 and 64bit on both arm and x86 architectures

18099224
realloc	malloc
on the first invocation the malloc call returns a full 64 bit pointer and writes to the memory don t trigger invalid memory access but subsequent calls to realloc to try and extend the size of the buffer exhibit the same problem as before

18099240
post	get
i want to capture decoded get and post data using that software

18099244

width	height
width and height without the browser worrying about funny shapes

18099355
width	height
if you need that your modal pop-up have width and height in

18099355
width	height
of course with js you can make the height or width depend of the window resolution by changing css attributes after page load or after resize

18099378
getter	setter
persitence frameworks often use reflection and more specifically to instantiate your objects then call getter setter by introspection to set the fields

18099378
getter	setter
that is why you need an empty constructor and getter setter

18099399
portrait	landscape
can change from portrait to landscape this works inside tabs fragments

18099421
post	get
the difference is that when autoexpandhorizontalscroll is true i get the autoscroll problem described in the original post but when i set it to false my body stops this annoying autoscrolling

18099426
hide	show
in one of my charts a basic column chart i have multiple series which i can click on the name displayed on the bottom to show hide

18099430
children	parent
my goal is to display a family tree where a root node would have both multiple parent and children

18099434
children	parent
there seem to be some issues in the windows phone framework and in the windows store framework in fact related to elements that are children of other elements and how when the parent element has been destroyed the framework thinks the child element still belongs to it elements can t have more than one parent

18099537
width	height
your image changes proportions because you set both the width and height in respect with the window size

18099537

18099586
implements	extends
i am sure the product will extends more and there will be more complex graphical interactions to implements in the future

18099600
width	height
i m trying to display two divs with the height set to a 3rd of the body width and match these height if the divs require more space to match one aother

18099600
width	height
this gets the width and sets as height perfectly i ve tried using equal height snippets with this but nothing yet has worked

18099616
liferay	web-inf
i added a liferay-plugin-package.xml to my application s web-inf to have liferay believe it s a portlet but i still don t know how if i can have liferay tell my other application s servlets if requests are coming from a user that has signed on or not

18099674
google-chrome	firefox
usually the issue isn t there or is minimal in firefox or google-chrome though and ie is mostly not playing ball and my guess is that this has to do with memory and dom manipulation

18099753
hide	show
then hide show specific series using series.hide series.show

18099766
jar	manifest.mf
a basic osgi bundle what you refer as plugin is nothing else than a jar file with a special plain text file in there the manifest.mf file

18099766

18099914
google-chrome	firefox
this disables the selection of a div like the one below in google-chrome but not in firefox

image support jpeg png and gif

18099966
gridview	objectdatasource
i got simple problem but i got no idea about where is problem so in my gridview i am using objectdatasource with custom paging like in this tutorial

18099994
google-chrome	safari
i created a jsfiddle that sortof recreates my issue look at it in google-chrome or safari

18100012
children	parent
also if you can help clean up the code in such a way that i don t need to write separate js to make inner nested toggles work independently of its parent or children toggles it would great

18100034
bower	npm
generally speaking npm modules are exposed as commonjs modules and can t be used in the browser unless you use something like bower

now my problem is when i start calendarview.java and ads appears activity goes in onpause state now when i cancel those ads and comes back on calendarview.java activity comes in onresume state

18100224
int	chars
you could use std transform using your own function object or lambda function making the reverse cast chars int

18100227
realloc	malloc
the problem was failing to include to get the correct prototypes for realloc malloc etc

18100239
puts	gets
alternatively you can also use the gets and puts method

18100246
decoder	encoder
and as many other things the encoder decoder does most of the job meaning a bad encoder will produce worse results even if the standard itself can produce much better

18100246
decoder	encoder
i am currently limited to the inbuilt jpeg encoder decoder as i have not fully grasped how to p invoke from other encoders decoders libjpeg etc but thatâ s off topic to this

18100249
folder	directory
you need to edit the manifest.xml which is located in the root directory of your project not the one located in the bin folder

18100257
getter	setter
and my bean has getter and setter for

18100261
put	get
if you put a single quote php don t parse the content of what is about to print it just print it as text so what you have should print name in the html...but since i don t see any name text in the black screenshot i think you might even not get into that loop.

18100301
mouseleave	mouseenter
you dont really want to unbind the events what you want to do is make mouseenter and mouseleave events conditional give the .attachment element some property like status clicked when it has been clicked see example

18100306
int	chars
it does beg the question why your vector contains long long int when it should only be storing chars though

18100360
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
uiscrollview prevents touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended on view controller

18100498
qapplication	qcoreapplication
design pattern is totally wrong qapplication as well as qcoreapplication are not supposed to be multiplied inside one application

18100500

width	height
i don t mean the width and height of the whole chart but only of the plot area that excludes the x and y axes labels and borders

18100670
addition	multiplication
this probably explains the usage of this specific mlcg without addition without xoring just one multiplication

18100680
int	chars
the problem is that you read a chars and interpret it as an int

18100690
ant	maven
so i have a project that runs jenkins which calls maven which calls ant dont ask why which runs a series of jmeter tests

18100690

jtable	jlabel
jtable by default uses a jlabel as its rendering component so basically you need to tell that label how to shorten your string

18105632
move	drag
the problem is this is that although the height reduces in the view the height that is taken for the drag is the original height of the div meaning that i have to drag a div way below in the page to make it move down in the condensed structure

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
having filed a bug with firefox it seems that it is safari google-chrome that are doing it wrong

18105687
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the firefox team have now opened bugs on this issue for both google-chrome and safari

18105731
button	checkbox
selection of any checkbox on the page will enable a submit button on the page which when clicked will pass the value of the boxes checked into another function

18105766
button	checkbox
other solution button is html element button and checkbox an html element

18105811
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox worked fine but ie failed

18105818
memmove	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	memmove
in this situation memmove would be needed over memcpy or strncpy because the target and destination overlap

18105832
mouse	keyboard
as ggrec wrote a better way to do it would be to execute your mouse press directly when the keyboard event is fired

18105849
button	checkbox
i have another similar list and i want the checkbox there to behave like radio button

18105888
typedef	struct
in general a pointer or a struct that has elements that can reasonably be directly accessed should never be a typedef

18105936
post	get
hey this is my second post so don t get mad at me but i m having issues with the jpanel in java

18105943
button	checkbox
that said using real checkbox and radio button is frequently the better way to go not least for support of mobile devices tablets phones etc.

18105943
button	checkbox
you can use label elements to make them easy to click and style them thoroughly but by making them real checkbox radio button you give the user agent browser information to work with that you re losing by rolling your own

18105945
button	checkbox
if you want to theme your elements there are jquery plugins that can replace the actual checkbox and radio button with prettyfied versions see here

18105964
for-loop	arrays
you need to iterate over the items in the r1 arrays using a for-loop

18105999
mouseleave	mouseenter
you d want to use mouseenter and mouseleave

18106017
post	get
make a call to post 1.json and you ll get

18106067
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use mouseenter or mouseleave like

this step work fine with selenium2 and google-chrome firefox but doesn t work with phantomjs

18106149
box-sizing	border-box
if you look at my jsfiddle i ve added some extra styling including box-sizing border-box

18106201
inherited	properties
the id properties is inherited from system.web.control

18106223
post	get
the trick basically is to use python s excellent requests module post but since google require a get request use the x-http-method-override header to override the request method to get

18106274
children	parent
when i remove the behaviour is the same except it will close the parent form when all children are gone

18106312
put	get
this should be pretty simple - get content from a h1 tag strip the span tag and put the remaining into a input tag

18106327
pydoc	argparse
i am using argparse.argumentparser in my script i would like to display the pydoc description of my script as part of the --help option of the argparse

18106510
xcodebuild	xcodeproj
i don t have the liberty of modifying the xcodeproj that s why i want to inject these flags via the xcodebuild command

18106539
post	get
have a look at this post maybe you get some new information there

18106564
google-chrome	firefox
fabric.js thinks that your google-chrome firefox have touch enabled so it attaches itself to touch events instead of mouse events

18106564
google-chrome	firefox
it is not too clear to me whether this is a bug in google-chrome firefox or in fabric or both

18106588
google-chrome	firefox
i want launch browsers firefox google-chrome for test with disabled cookies i tried this

18106701
post	get
the thing is i m new to sending post get messages and i m not sure how do i need to post variable containing xml data to a web-server

18106701
post	get
use post or get variable test with xml string on a specified url

18106761
awt	swing
i ve read over a lot of this painting in awt and swing and other threads that perform this type of action

18106801
updatepanel	scriptmanager
ps i don t want to use updatepanel and scriptmanager

18106814
post	get
i am using restfb to get the number of likes in an specific post and it was working well

18106814
post	get
after retrieving the post from a page when trying to get the number of likes that this post has i get this

18106816
width	height
safari will trigger the transitionend with width and height on load

18106838
button	checkbox
i have a button on my page and onclicking that button all approved checkbox should be set.i have another button which tracks the state of all approvals basically if everything is approved then that button submit should be enabled and if any of the field is not approved then that button should be disabled

18106864
hide	show
i m trying to find solutions that use hide and show only or if the requirement can be fulfilled

18106896
hide	show
functions show and hide works on existing fragments

18106897
listview	gridview
now whenever i get a video i display it s corresponding image and show it in a listview or gridview again not relevant

18106919
rational-numbers	base
additionally rational-numbers that are exactly representable as floating point numbers in base 10 like 0.1 or 0.7 do not have an exact representation as floating point numbers in base 2 which is used internally no matter the size of the mantissa

18106924
put	get
however when i put this into an update i cant seem to get the tmp table updated

18106928
onresume	onpause
in the onpause set it to false and in onresume and oncreate set it to true

18106933
getter	setter
i just need basic advice setting up the parent class which is just made up of the getter and setter and variables

18107017
temp	tmp
one last thing would be after this line 120 to echo out the result of tmp output to a temp file and look at its output to see if it has really worked

18107031
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it has a ui for recording test actions in all major browsers internet explorer firefox google-chrome and playback in same browsers including safari

18107062
post	get
you can t have it both ways - either you post to the server and get a new page or you don t

18107105
google-chrome	safari
it works great in ios safari and google-chrome

18107135
jquery	mcustomscrollbar
mcustomscrollbar is not a part of jquery you ll need to reference the plugin

18107148
udp	tcp
this module offers tcp or udp communication

18107148
udp	tcp
i have no knowledge of tcp or udp

18107151
width	height
no it s not 100 always true but it s close enough to 100 that you should just assume if you re asking for top left bottom right height width or anything that affects those measurements like scale roation etc you re going to cause an r r

18107152
post	get
the next parameter should be either in the get or the post data for the request

18107152
post	get
in your urls.py you can only pass extra parameters to the view function itself not to the get or post data

18107155
hide	show
2 if you want to submit back to server and run code behind to do some other server side scripting then remove change_page script from asp button and show hide divs in codebehind

18107225
google-chrome	firefox
what browser are they most likely to be using if they are mostly using ie9+ google-chrome firefox etc

18107229
width	margin
since you already have a width defined on your menu you can use margin 0 auto

18107245
google-chrome	firefox
try and capture what it is doing it is also worth running developer tools on your browser whether its firefox of google-chrome and trying to figure out on what elements it is taking that time - but between the logs and the browser developer tools should lie your answer

18107267
uiview	subviews
if i have a uiview instance variable that i add to a another view as a subviews

18107287
partialfunction	implicit
this would be particuarly useful when debugging complex partialfunction implicit conversions etc.

18107406
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

18107414
udp	tcp
as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead

18107414
udp	tcp
it s possible to build reliability on top of udp but you are basically reinventing tcp

18107414
udp	tcp
question 4 tcp or udp

18107432
joptionpane	jdialog
technically you can loop through all windows of the application check is they are of type jdialog and have a child of type joptionpane and dispose the dialog if so

18107441
put	get
but all i know and fully understand is its used in get and put requests

18107451
pop-up	dialog
i created links to each item in order to edit them via the sharepoint modal dialog pop-up ui

18107492
cagradientlayer	uibutton
i have a custom button that is just a standard uibutton but with a cagradientlayer added in

18107510
for-loop	arrays
so i mean if for some weird reason you are running a for-loop on this empty arrays you know it will run at least once but that s really scraping the barrel for a reason

18107530
post	get
to get all post in my news feed i know i can use this

18107537
hide	show
you can hide form do not render it and show only confirmation message to make sure user won t try to send comment again

18107541
stdout	stderr
the security questions aside my objective is to determine if the code that might be in any language compiled or interpreted writes the correct things to stdout stderr and other files on given input fed into the program s stdin

18107541
stdout	stderr
currently my solution is to spawn the child process using subprocess.popen ... with file handles for the stdout stderr and stdin

18107541
stdout	stderr
the file behind the stdin handle contains the inputs that the program reads during operation and after the program has terminated the stdout and stderr files are read and checked for correctness

18107541
stdout	stderr
after that i ve given the slave file descriptor as an argument for the subprocess.popen ... call s stdout stderr and stdin parameters

18107542
nunit	moq
i m using nunit and moq

18107546
subtraction	addition
for the subtraction case do the same thing as addition only when you find the difference just remove it from list #1

18107547
implements	extends
i ve implements my operation class and it extends org.eclipse.core.commands.operations.abstractoperation so it has implementations of the methods execute redo and undo

18107549
textmate	sublimetext
rsub is an implementation of textmate 2 s rmate feature for sublimetext 2 allowing files to be edited on a remote server using ssh port forwarding tunnelling

18107612
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is the odd man out here as the code in the else is sufficient to submit via ie and firefox

18107645
integer	unsigned
it was designed to provide users with a format specifier for unsigned 64-bit integer across different architectures

18107688
width	height
as a workaround you can set an explicit height or width probably height in this case and that will oftentimes resolve this issue

18107741
guava	lambdaj
i was looking at guava and lambdaj but i was not able to find a solution sample for doing intersection by custom comparison logic

18107775
post	get
the way it works users follow certain catergories of post group whenever there is a new post or comment under the post category group they get email message notifying them with a snippet of the post itself

18107778
put	get
these methods get put into a loop running automated searches until the user selects an option to shut off the thread

18107780
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
but in c++ inherited there is not a mechanism for to make call to subclassing s methods because a class can to have many subclassing and the superclass have not the subclassing s reference because the polymorphism function from subclassing to superclass and not in mode inverse

18107784
getter	setter
lately i m writing my getter and setter as note real classes do more things in getter setter

18107799
bluetooth	usb
changes such as when the user unplugs a usb bluetooth adapter

18107801
puts	gets
the script that gets the data samples the cumulative amount of bytes sent by user to server id and puts in the time it was sampled then goes to the next row

18107837
put	get	post	get	post	put
as mentioned in the docs if we want to create an api that handle create get put post and delete requests we must override implement the following methods

18107845
google-chrome	firefox
i have a svg background that looks find in both firefox google-chrome but my search icon is ok in the firefox and wont display in google-chrome

18107979
action-filter	onactionexecuting
you can create a global action-filter and override onactionexecuting

18108018
shadowing	named
so if you are shadowing a method called dosomething withawesome you would named your category method ogr_dosomething withawesome assuming you use ogr as your common prefix

18108019
versioning	upgrade
i don t want to know how long it would take you to run through all those upgrade and even then i think you would be unlikely to have working copies of all ie versioning at the end of it

18108065
chown	chmod
this is possible by either using chmod chown to change the device file s permissions or use to add the current user to that devices group

18108087
libzip	zlib
it is possible to access any file anywhere in the apk using zlib and libzip in c++

18108087
libzip	zlib
requirements some java zlib and or libzip for ease of use so that s what i settled for

18108087
libzip	zlib
assuming that you now have a std string with your apk location and you have zlib on libzip working you can do something like this

18108090
post	get
ok i changed the php script to use post instead of get which should clear up the length issue

18108090
post	get
the results in a get request which doesn t work with my script post .furthermore i believe this means i m running the php script twice which makes no sense

18108092
post	get
the only difference between the two routes is that one is a post and the other is a get

18108092
post	get
i always get the cookie that i set via the post route even if i later overwrite it using the get route

18108129
cpu	affinity
i ve confirmed that sql server has the cpu affinity across all cores cpus

18108135
versioning	upgrade
the package in question is pyfuzz and i just upgrade to versioning 0.1.1 but for some reason when i pip install it even with the --upgrade flag i can only pull down 0.1.0

18108146
width	height
the width and height are set to max-width 100 this breaks it because the way the slider works is to extend the gallery as far off screen as possible and the height to auto this breaks it because it allows the images to just keep piling on

18108174
getter	setter
but my main question if you want some kind of input validation why not use a dedicated setter and a dedicated getter

18108174
getter	setter
regarding your second example after the edit with the vector - using your getter setter makes even more sense than your original example as you want to give access to the values allow the user to change the values but not to the vector you don t want the user to be able to change the size of the vector

18108174
getter	setter
so even though in the first example i really would recommend making the member public in the second one it is clearly not an option and using this form of getter setter really is a good option if no input validation is needed

18108174
getter	setter
although it maybe ugly enough that you d still want your getter setter in addition to this

18108177
textview	imageview
or add to your imageview and textview

18108184
udp	tcp
that would normally mean some form of network protocol tcp udp sockets http etc.

18108185
stdout	stderr
have you noticed that raw_input writes the prompt string into stderr if stdout is terminal isatty

18108241
getter	setter
i tried to add custom chef resource package subclass attribute and appropriate setter getter wrapper with set_or_return function

18108282
width	height
the solution i found is to set the maximum height and width to 100

18108327
udp	tcp
wp 802.11b has a maximum raw data rate of 11 mbit s ... in practice the maximum 802.11b throughput that an application can achieve is about 5.9 mbit s using tcp and 7.1 mbit s using udp

18108327
udp	tcp
see any generic java tcp udp tutorial how

18108327
udp	tcp
there are implementations on top of udp that act like a tcp connection

18108378
for-loop	loops
the for-loop assigns a new value to i every loops iteration namely the next value taken from loops iterable in this case range 16

18108378
for-loop	loops
range simply generates a sequence of numbers to loops over as opposed to a c-style for-loop which combines the initial assignment test and loops incrementer into one statement

18108418
stdout	stderr
the message below is probably going to stderr instead of stdout so you will need to capture the stderr output first

18108423
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
like first division then multiplication then subtraction like in dmas rule or is there some other rule

18108441
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
this means that multiplication and division comes before subtraction with operators of equal precedence being applied from left to right so the expression can be read as

18108445
getter	setter
i saw that pagingtoolbar exposes its messages via getter setter but i don t know how to get it from the combobox

18108450
google-chrome	firefox
tried downloading it using google-chrome and firefox but fail

18108452
width	margin	width	height	margin	height	portrait	landscape
i am trying to set various print options for a spreadsheet i am creating using their re-vamped simple api however it does not appear they have yet exposed an easy way to modify document properties such as page margin page size height width and page orientation landscape portrait

18108453
width	height
then we can set the various properties such as margins orientation and height width

18108453
width	height
note that the height and width values seem to be required for the page orientation value to work properly and the height ad width need to be the height and width of the orientation being used

18108493
fgets	getline
a better way to read user input in c is to use fgets or getline if available and long lines are a concern to read entire lines at a time then convert numbers to binary with the family of functions which -- unlike scanf -- have well-defined behavior on input overflow

18108496
std	ostream
the type of the lhs is std ostream so std is an associated namespace and therefore is found

18108496
std	ostream
as it is the compiler notices that the first argument to is an ostream defined in std

18108535
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box to .group so that the width is inclusive of the padding 10px

18108535
inherited	properties
cleaned up css in media queries by removing duplicate properties that is already inherited from common style for .group for all screens

18108535
width	margin
because margin in depends on the container width

18108621
post	get
technically you shouldn t even see the parameter in your url since you re using the post method get will pass them through the url

18108624
google-chrome	firefox
currently the only way to do so is to ask for a second stream of audio only which implies a second request or construct a new stream just from the audio track and stop release the first stream but there s no easy way to make that work in firefox yet until onnegotiationneeded is supported for re-invite-type operations and mediastream track-based constructors if you want to avoid the second permission request - note google-chrome s model for permissiona may hide this from you

18108688
put	get
i m sure if you ask 10 people you ll get 10 different answers but i would put the survey logic in an application layer and not in the database

18108698
try-catch	exception-handling
add try-catch blocks around the code you want to handle exception-handling for like this

18108731
post	get
but that will eventually get complicated and show looooong lists of duplicated category names in the post editor

18108731
post	get
at the moment it displays all the tagged post but what i am trying to get it to display is a list of categories in a tag instead.

18108744
jquery	icheck
i use two jquery plugins slidecontrol and icheck then i use this script

18108770
put	get
also make sure to put your mycallout declaration before using it otherwise you will get an error like

18108838
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you only produce major upgrade in msi no patches and you rely on the uninstall old versioning before install new versioning strategy the default in installshield then normally you will never have a situation of overinstalling files given some conditions like having no shared files again

18108849
submit	submission
i would like to execute my ajax call on form submit and only after its execution continue form submission

18108852
rbenv	homebrew
if you re using rbenv and homebrew

18108902
versioning	upgrade
it appears that you have recently upgrade your subversion client and the new versioning 1.7.x is having problems with the wc.db file from an older versioning

18108932
ubuntu	linux
i m working on linux ubuntu

18108960
children	parent
ideally i want it so that if a parent has 5 or more children it would result in the layout below

18108971
factors	matrix
my best guess at what to do is to pass through the data once to find out how long many rows of data i will have there are several factors levels and the summary matrix will have a row for each possible combination of factors

18108980
min	max
x.bin - seq floor min d 1 ceiling max df 1 by 2

18108980
min	max
y.bin - seq floor min d 2 ceiling max df 2 by 2

18109076
cpu	processors
modern cpu s know how to optimise data-dependent jump instructions as well as it can for data dependent branch instructions - the processors will learn that last time i went through here i went this way and if it has enough confidence gone through several times with the same result it ill keep going that way

18109132
google-chrome	firefox
right now most of those can t be set in firefox or google-chrome

18109134
typedef	struct
if you use typedef you can create a volatile type for a struct

18109193
opera	firefox
now i have opened pgadmin netbeans with 10 active tabs and firefox and the free memory is 150+mb free + 20+mb buffers + 200+mb cached and if i need more memory when i open opera or any other program some of the cached memory is released as it should be done

18109222
entity-relationship	diagram
i m new to orms and entity-relationship diagram and trying to figure out how to best describe implement the following

18109264
ubuntu	linux
if you re running ubuntu not sure how well this works for other linux flavors just follow this tutorial from digitalocean

18109268
hide	show
then you could write jquery to hide them initially and show them on click of a button

18109288
accessor	properties
the funny-looking constant you see in ildasm is mainly because that overload will only have emitted four bytes for the 0 value but an 8 byte constant was expected so it interpreted the following opcodes as the higher order bytes of the constant which also explains why the properties accessor call was apparently replaced with a completely different opcode

18109329
tablet	galaxy
however this causes problems when going from tablet to phone nexus7 galaxy s3

18109387
burn	uninstaller
i ve created a custom boot-strapper for my application using wix and burn but in the time it took to learn i managed to install several early variants in such a way that they won t uninstaller

18109470
width	height
if you want to open a device with different dimension than default you need to issue a command with different height and width values than default or you can stretch an existing window if your gui supports that action

18109564
free	malloc
these tasks have to do crazy things like malloc and free memory

18109564
free	malloc
unfortunately if i do this enough times one of the tasks will get stuck in the memory both malloc and free routines on a semaphore

18109564
free	malloc
it s always the second task that gets lost at the very start of the task in either free or malloc

18109614
children	parent
i have a company pom aggregator parent pom and children

18109627
switching	screens
when switching to a mobile screens size media max-width 979px i want the accordion panel to close automatically effectively i want the div refine-search line to change to collapse out

18109701
labwindows	cvi
i do not have access to the labwindows cvi real-time module therefore cannot see the function prototype you are referring to

18109740
switching	screens
the user expects my app to switching off the screens after being used

18109740
switching	screens
so i guess my question is how can an app reliably switching off the screens i m not holding a wakelock i m using the windowmanager -flags flag_turn_screen_on in onattachedtowindow

18109748
google-chrome	firefox
i was working through the angular.js todo application video tutorial and i encountered a problem including the twitter bootstrap 3 glyphicons in the index.html file the icons show up as non-descriptive images both in google-chrome and in firefox

18109752
google-chrome	firefox
you will probably not see the warning unless it s firefox because i didn t in my consecutive tries on google-chrome and i was logged in when i got the error

18109770
fileinputstream	objectinputstream	fileinputstream	objectoutputstream	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream	objectinputstream	fileoutputstream	objectinputstream	fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
writing to an new objectoutputstream new fileoutputstream filename you can get your objects back using an new objectinputstream new fileinputstream filename

18109804
width	height
you could dynamically count the children and adjust the width height of the dom element accordingly

18109851
portrait	landscape
the portrait view looks fine but when i flip to landscape things are of course stretched

addition	multiplication
i altered the code to write out when it enter a constructor operator and destructor in addition to printing the matrices after the multiplication

18113986
addition	multiplication
the addition operator mirrors the first multiplication operator and appears to work fine no exceptions the copy constructor and destructor happen as expected

18114008
subtract	add
i could just take the old pointer subtract it from the new pointer and add the result to each of the pointers i need to change

18114008
subtract	add
however this only works if it is possible to subtract two pointers and get the difference in their addresses and then add that difference to another pointer to get the pointer that many bytes ahead

int	double
double stores numbers of the form s 2 p where s and p are int

18114036
int	double
the number 2.01 is not of the form s 2 p for any int s p so it cannot be stored exactly in a double

18114050

how do i run four or five jobs using the same quartz cron trigger.extending the code must be easy as we will keep on adding the jobs as we go on

18114082
dbcontext	objectcontext
returns a new query where the entities returned will not be cached in the dbcontext or objectcontext

18114088
google-chrome	firefox
geckofx and webkit.net were both promising at first but they didn t keep up to date with firefox and google-chrome respectively while as internet explorer improved so did the webbrowser control though it behaves like ie7 by default regardless of what ie version you have but that can be fixed by going into the registry and change it to ie9 allowing html5

18114098
setinterval	settimeout
any time you are using settimeout or setinterval you should opt for passing an actual function instead of a string

18114103
r5rs	r6rs
if your doing this in an r5rs or r6rs both not behaving the same is a violation of the report

18114125
ienumerable	iqueryable	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	iqueryable
iqueryable implements ienumerable as well along with ilist and arrays

18114135
multiplying	modulo
so for each query you can then compute the final answer by raising each prime to the corresponding power and multiplying the results together modulo m

18114141

you set it to add but you never clear the add when you set it to multiplying

18114167
width	height
set width and height to match the size of the background image

18114167
width	height
the reason the image is being cut off is because the background image isn t taken into account as it automatically calculates the width and height to only be as big as it needs to be

18114185
internationalization	translation
t is the translation method for internationalization

18114208
obiee	cognos	pentaho	cognos	pentaho	obiee
some options are obiee sql server reporting services cognos and pentaho free

18114208
vertica	teradata
if you need instant answers for arbitrary queries involving aggregations on large volumes billion row datasets you could look into teradata netezza vertica and the like

18114217
hide	show
the benefit of option 3 is it s again my opinion easier to conditionally show hide alter parts of the form depending on business logic doesn t sound like an issue for you per se but it s worth keeping in mind.

18114226
mri	rubinius
rubinius 1.2 also still have the gil so i believe it will be the same as mri

in this way module1 will have a mix of junit unit tests and testng integration tests each group to be run by surefire and failsafe respectively starting up a jetty server in the pre-integration phase

18114379
maven	pom.xml
if you re building your wicket app via maven and creating a war file of the form artifactid-version.war and the servlet engine s using that as the deployed name one option would be to set the project.build.finalname property in the pom.xml to be project.artifactid or the warname value in the war plugin config

18114380
for-loop	arrays
i assume that you create a for-loop to run through the objects so if i wanted to create a mutable arrays called citynames to populate just the city names into this arrays i would use this kind of for-loop

18114411
folder	directory
check if there s a directory called by adding root it would www blog this check will succeed so it tries to list the content of the folder

18114457

int	boolean
just checks for an equal value returns true while also checks for the type is false int vs boolean

18114674
getter	setter
i m not familiar with the db apis at all but it appears plausible to create a small support library in c to actually create an instance of the db struct then expose the public members of the struct __db via getter and setter functions

18114677
width	height
i have a 310px width x 128px height image

18114712
range	minimum
this standard requires only using the minimum number of bits to transmit the data to the maximum defined range it can be

18114715
screens	hdpi
screens densities and sizes you can test on the emulator but you should still test it on a few different phones to see how it actually behaves on ldpi hdpi mdpi...especially if you are using images in your app.----the emulator showed that everything is perfect but once i installed on phones it turned out the other way.

18114738
stdout	stderr
if subprocesses write anything to stdout or stderr intentionally or not that could cause trouble

onkeyup	onkeydown
onkeyup and onkeydown from where i found that keypress is supposed to fire whenever a character is typed into the text input

18114752
keydown	keyup
if i bind 3 handlers for keyup keydown and keypress god i am desperate

18114765
width	height
what this entailed was swapping the height and width as well as translating the svg to re-center it

18114768
int	double
as you ve observed you can repeatedly double the range of a possible random values through powers of two by concatenating bits but if you start with an int number of bits like zero then you cannot obtain any range with prime factors other than two

18114777
min	max
i ve created a custom validation directive called wrinteger which takes two additional attributes max and min

18114777
min	max

but it s your task to find the way how to read write that raw data from into an actual file opencl doesn t support jpg png gif or other compression and file formats out of the box

18114826
libjpeg	libpng
for example if you want to read write jpeg then you can use libjpeg similarly libpng in case of png and so on

18114867
calloc	malloc
in fact you can use malloc or calloc to get memory for each node

18114882
children	parent
if you re using the fork start method for multiprocessingâ which you can on most non-windows platformsâ each child process gets any resources the parent had when the child was started which can be another way to pass data to children

18114888
datediff	difference
for datediff i want to find the difference between the earliest transaction date and latest transaction date

18114890
sudo	passwd
i also tried command sudo neo4j install after i provided the passwd i got same error neo4j command not found

18114904
width	height
so the problem is that my images were inheriting a style height and width of auto and wax.g s gettile method method creates an image using new image 256 256 which writes to height and width attributes of the img itself img attributes not inline style

18114904
width	height
i fixed this by ensuring the img had a height and width of 256 using inline styling

18114918
gif	png
this script looks through a directory identifies all gif jpg jpeg and png files and displays them in a body section

18114935
rdf	owl
this also really doesn t help for the case that you ve got since owl classes aren t individuals so they can t be the object of object properties and rdf type isn t an object property

18115023
ubuntu	linux
i followed his instructions one by one but had different results on windows 7 and linux ubuntu

18115030
vim	emacs
some examples of the server approach for extending language support in other editors would be the vimclojure plugin which talks to a separate java process to add clojure support to vim or ensime which connects to a server written in scala to add scala support to emacs

18115033
google-chrome	firefox
they all work properly in google-chrome and firefox but one of them will not close when i click the x in internet explorer 9

instead instantiate audiorecord and audiotrack only once and just handle their events

18115189
scalaz	combinators
the traverseu function is a common scalaz combinators

18115205
inherited	properties
since the properties of form-horizontal are already inherited from the parent form there is no need to repeat oneself

18115214
put	get
video encoding is essentially just a specialized mathematical operation on binary data from one file to get more binary data to put in another file

18115252
google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox google-chrome and ie 10-7

18115273
tinyint	boolean
it turns out that cakephp assumes that tinyint 1 should be a boolean type because mysql aliases bool to tinyint 1

18115308
jsdom	cheerio
my guess is you think the documents created with jsdom cheerio are persisted to disk

18115366
put	get
you can put lock on main thread as reed copsey suggested but you can not ensure which thread will get lock first

18115376
for-loop	loops
you could also test every time in the for-loop and include a break statement but because you don t know when it will stop i think a while loops is better in this case

18115397
setinterval	settimeout
the thing i found odd was that the animations only started working after i completely commented out the settimeout and setinterval

18115404
many-to-many	one-to-many
however so far i ve only found soutions for one-to-many relations sorting topics in a thread by their most recent post and i think i understand them but none involving these three-way joins for many-to-many relations

18115407
awt	swing
you may want to check out painting in awt and swing for more details about the paint process in swing

18115473
int	double
this way as well you can mix string int double long float etc

18115474
ng-show	ng-hide	ng-switch	ng-show	ng-switch	ng-hide
instead of using ng-show ng-hide angular has a directive called ng-switch

18115484
put	get
if you don t put them in the right order you ll get a linker error complaining about the missing symbol winmain 16

18115568

the objective here is to fit the fixed width and height of box inside of the parent box not sure if i said that correctly

18115950
uitableview	reloaddata
however when i use uitableview reloaddata the cells stay the same

18115955
post	get
but as it took me a lot of time and research to get to that point i ll post the code as follows

18115963
squash	branch
recently i ve been working in another branch and using squash

18115977
post	get
it picks up both post and get variables rather than having to distinguish between the two

18116002
width	height
window.open editpopup.php edit width 300 height 200

18116014

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works ok in firefox and google-chrome but not at all in msie safari and opera

18116062
int	chars
the couple class needs two data members - a chars and an int

18116062
int	chars
the data members should have getters - public chars getchar and public int getlength returning their respective members

18116064
hide	show
i have the show hide functionality working where it show the odd images with an odd button and show even images with an even button

18116064
hide	show
but if all images are currently show clicking even should show the even images and hide the odd .

18116064
hide	show
clicking odd should show the odd and hide the even

18116150
prepare	execute
second you should always check the return status of prepare and execute

18116150
prepare	execute
notice that an error on prepare returns its message in mysqli- error but an error on execute returns its message in stmt- error

18116159
decoder	encoder
my problem is that in opus the encoder and decoder work with audio samples at 48khz whereas the only sample rate that android guarantees to work is 44.1 khz

18116189
zoo	lubridate
other date-aggregation options besides format.posixt do include the functions in package lubridate and the yearmon class supported in package zoo

18116242
folder	directory
file - import - android code into workspace - select root directory folder of the application you are importing - check the copy projects into workspace checkbox - click finish en twitter puedes preguntar ds

18116375
for-loop	arrays
if that is not an option you can copy that functions process by using a for-loop to create a new arrays using the values of your arrays as keys and then increase the value of each key by 1

18116375
post	get
but if you post what you have tried so far i would be willing to look it over and provide corrections edits to get your code to work

18116395
width	height
i m currently using cycle2 with scrollhorz on full screen 100 width and height with background images with their size to cover besides that there are no callbacks or much else on the page so its a very basic slider

18116407
bash	subshell
in bash 4 the lastpipe option was introduced to allow the last command in a pipeline to execute in the current shell not a subshell alleviating the problem with such pipelines

18116458
move	drag
however when user move mouse over the pipe at the position of the hidden column there is a cursor indicator appearing to notify user something like there is a zero-width column here just hold mouse down and drag to resize it

18116462
post	put
what about making a class that match the json you are trying to send and put an on it then you use a json parser like gson and use a stringentity for send the post request here is an example

18116462
getter	setter
googlecalendarjson class must have getter setter

18116473
arraylist	treeset
a treeset will probably be more efficient than trying to maintain an arraylist in order assuming that there are random insertions and or random deletions

18116524
onclick	onchange	onchange	onblur
listeners added in the markup or as element properties can be found by testing related element properties and attributes somewhat tedious testing for onclick onchange onblur etc

18116543
screens	tablet
since tablet screens is large we can show both pane on the screens and it will be easy for the user to use

18116644
hide	show
this line take about 6s i want to show loading icon and when above line finish the loading icon will hide

18116673
for-loop	arrays
after you first do the for-loop to list your input arrays the i value is 6

18116729
pbkdf2	hash
pbkdf s may use hash pbkdf2 or keyed block ciphers bcrypt

18116729
hash	hmac
most kdf s are using message authentication codes hmac or mac instead of directly using the underlying hash algorithm or block cipher

18116729
hash	salt
the salt and iteration count should be stored with the hash

18116729
hash	whirlpool
finally it is probably better to use a nist vetted hash algorithm such as sha-512 instead of whirlpool

18116735
portrait	landscape
the other three horizontal components are optional the left and right i-beams struts say if i go between landscape and portrait keep the left and right distances pegged where they are and the left and right arrow in the middle the spring says and let this change the width as the superview gets wider or narrower.

18116771
int	double
both loops are spanning a range in double but i use an int in parallel to avoid round off problems at the loop end

18116780
hide	show
i been working for a while trying to have my link show and hide a paragraph below it

18116780
hide	show
the paragraph must be hidden on load and show once the link is clicked and then hide again when link is clicked again

18116793
width	height
i created a contentcontrol that allows me wrap content to add a dynamic percentage width height

18116800
width	height
i created a contentcontrol that allows me wrap content to add a dynamic percentage width height

18116913
put	get
notice that i was able to input data under the telephone number but did not get the chance to put it in the address section

18116999
hide	show
by clicking legend we can control the slice display or not i want top 10 by count of the chart slices show by default and others hide by clicking legend they can be added to pie chart

18117025
client-side	server-side
javascript is a client-side language and php is a server-side language

18117038
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
creating an object that takes the place of so instead of a for-loop that loops through the contents of the arrays loops from and then sets the object at that index to the item i created before loops

18117094
getter	setter
3 double check getter setter of the property they were ok wasn t the error

18117106
nstimer	nsrunloop
it creates an nstimer s entity and adds the timer automatically to the nsrunloop associated with the nsthread in which the timer is created

18117136
listview	gridview
the is done to conserve the memory and to improve performance of gridview and listview

18117146
jtextfield	jlabel
i made a jdialog with a jlabel jtextfield and two jbuttons next and previous

18117229
getter	setter
so instead of reading writing directly you use a getter and setter function

18117281
for-loop	loops
therefore when you want to loops though it with a for-loop it randomly returns it s entries not truly random because memory and stuff

18117314
put	get
i recommend going with a service who has put in the time to ensure their e-mails get through

18117316
google-chrome	firefox
i don t think it will work in firefox or google-chrome

18117410
int	boolean
it will store in mysql the same way and cake will automatically know to return the int value rather than the boolean true false

18117417
serializable	deserialization
however this is specific to parameterdisplaymodeenum and i have a bunch of enums that i need to treat this way for serializable deserialization so i would prefer to have a generic such as

18117417
serializable	deserialization
i am looking for a generic way to do the serializable deserialization without having to write a concrete list helper class each time

18117424
google-chrome	safari
it s like safari is using 180deg where google-chrome would render 270deg or something

18117424
google-chrome	safari
update i noticed that on this tutorial the same bug occurred in google-chrome but worked in safari

18117443
google-chrome	safari
the file browser pops up in google-chrome safari as it is their default behaviour - you don t have to emit a click event

18117449
for-loop	loops
additionally you should reset i each time you go through loops and a for-loop makes more sense than a while loops especially if you re using c99 as i can be declared within loops

18117478
strstr	strcmp
i ve done all this by preparing with strcmp and now with strstr which i believe is faster

18117527
put	get
â â i can t get the event to fire when i put the event in either of the views like drop #drop-zone handledrop

18117546
google-chrome	firefox
2 if you re using ie try to load your application in either google-chrome or firefox and go through the built-in debuggers setting up breakpoints in your js functions

18117571
range	minimum
32 bit ruby uses 32 bits to represent the time therefore it has a valid range from 13 dec 1901 20 45 54 utc to 19 jan 2038 03 14 07 utc as these are the minimum maximum signed integer values representable with 32 bits with time 0 being unix epoch time 1 jan 1970 00 00 00 utc

18117574
folder	directory
i was in the root directory one above the www directory here i have the plugins www platforms and merges folder and i run the following command

18117577
next	except
since the _id is fairly hard to guess and therefore a user with access to one entry based on the _id in the url can not guess the next or previous entry except for the example below based on their information

flax s solution works well one thing to note is that if you have uilabel or uibutton which are are contained in uicollectionviewcells in uicollectionviews or similar and these collections change frequently in the current view eg due to user action or being populated by an asynchronous request then to keep the labels updated with the correct localization strings you can call the localization function in viewdidlayoutsubviews instead of viewdidload which is called only once

hash	salt
just a quick note if you want to store passwords to anything important always hash it prefarably use salt hash

18129518
int	double
there are three functions dealing with int arrays 32 bit floating point arrays and double precision floating point arrays respectively

18129547

it works even after sorting and filtering

18130054
implements	extends
you can see an example here i ve only implements the one field but it should be possible to extends it pretty easily

18130114
octal	binary
the method below converts an integer to binary octal and hexadecimal where shift would be 2 3 or 4 and i be any integer

18130127
implements	extends

18130164
bash	zsh
also if i use zsh instead of bash then node command works

18130188
hash	md5
the shard keys are md5 sums of another document field similar to the hash shard keys in v2.4 of mongo so there should be more than enough variability to spray documents across the three shards

18130189
post	get
if anyone could either tell me how to get rid of it or how to format it better so that it doesn t look like just one line of random text above the post maybe to where i can move it to the left or something that would be awesome

18130297
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
tested and working in firefox google-chrome safari opera ie10 ie9 ie8 ie7 ie6 and ie5

18130320
apache	nginx
this is not a server issue so we don t have to go fiddle with apache nginx etc

18130320
submit	submission
if those obtain i d suggest not using a standard html form submission but rather have the submit button kick off a javascript function to oversee processing

18130320
apache	nginx
the web server timeouts may indeed need to be adjusted upward apache defaults to 300 seconds aka 5 minutes and nginx less iirc

18130358
width	margin
if the default margin on each side is 1 inch you are left with 6.5 inches width to really work with

18130399
width	height
what i want to be able to do is have a fixed table border height that adds rows max 5 per page and it s row s width can grow dynamically so something like

18130399
width	height
the only solution i can think of which probably isn t the best because i m a novice at both wicket and html is to have a div with a fixed height and growable width

18130399
width	height
and for css no matter what i try i can get the height to be fixed but the width will always expand to the end of the page

18130399
width	height
i just need to know how to make the div that contains the table wrap its width but have a fixed height

18130425
hive	hdfs
sqoop is good for bulk import from rdbms to hdfs hive hbase

18130451
division	multiplication
i d rather avoid any kind of operations like multiplication or division

18130468
subtract	add
you add the debits and subtract the credits and you can obtain the value you are seeking

18130479
typedef	struct
x could be a type typedef struct etc or it could be variable static variable

18130486
csv	tsv
hive only support one character as separator so indeed you would need to have a single field separator or a tsv csv format

18130498
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that only in firefox and google-chrome that with the default bold weight and normal font style the actual text gets pushed beyond the bottom boundary of the element

18130524
post	get
in other words it require you to have a web server with an web application that can accept get and post requests from server

18130529

width and height properties of the htmlimageelement

18130549
lisp	scheme
in any lisp common lisp and scheme at least you have member

18130571
for-loop	arrays
so technically the for-loop should constantly be looping i think but it only went through once and only after the arrays increases in size

18130596
folder	directory
error js-config.h no such file or directory but js-config.h.in is in the folder

18130597
pop-up	dialog
the issue i m having at the moment is when the dialog pop-up focus is given to the ok button instead of the jpasswordfield

18130767
accessor	properties
until arc came along one important aspect of properties or accessor generally was that they simplified memory management by reducing the number of places where an object needed to be retained or released

18130767
accessor	properties
there s an idea that accessor functions break encapsulation by exposing the inner working of an object and i think that s often a reason that people choose to use ivars instead of properties

18130767
accessor	properties
i disagree though you can always hide your properties in a class extension so that they re only visible to the class and in any case accessor allow you to change the implementation while still providing the same interface

18130767
accessor	properties
if there s a specific case where an accessor call is a real problem there are usually better ways to solve the problem than avoiding properties

18130798
filtering	grouping
like for all segment2 endpoints if you want to perform some filtering instead of adding the filtering to all the individual endpoints you can just add it to the grouping

18130810
express	node.js
i m assuming that it s having a problem connecting to the mongoose db but being an amateur in node.js express or mongoose i m not sure where to start to debug this

18130827

i am replacing an image with a with background-image for the reason of background-size cover

18130875
google-chrome	firefox
it works very well with google-chrome but not with firefox or ie

18130991
packets	multicast
when you craft a multicast message you send it to this dhcp server which then takes the packets finds the clients who are mapped to that multicast address and then send it in a special packets that routers automatically duplicate so if you have 2 people part of the group connected to 1 router and that router is connected to another router called router 2 router 2 won t send two packets it will send one and then router 1 will send two copies to its clients

18130991
packets	multicast
by listening to all active adapters you re not going to get anything but packets which aren t going to tell you if its part of a multicast network since they re going to look like every other packets since the router will change the multicast address to your ip address before you even see the packets

18131014
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
should work in firefox google-chrome safari and ie 9

18131040

18131042
pop-up	dialog
the first method tries to pop-up the dialog but realizes that the content has not yet been loaded

18131042
pop-up	dialog
nth time the first method will just let the dialog pop-up because the content was already loaded the first time

18131052
action-filter	onactionexecuting
for more complex logic you could create an action-filter derived from actionfilterattribute that catches the request either after the controller method onactionexecuting or before the view renders onresultexecuting

18131083
processors	hyperthreading
for instance on an intel x86 processors with hyperthreading both threads in a core must request a power-gated c-state for power-gating to occur at the core level and likewise all cores in a package must request a package-level power-gated c-state for power-gating to occur at the package level

18131094
google-chrome	firefox
and it work fine under google-chrome or firefox

18131094
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari

18136612
hide	show
add to your three elements you want to show hide then change the above to this

18136615
free	malloc
since the only code which would be likely to request a zero-byte malloc would be asking for a buffer whose size was determined at runtime and since any such code would expect to free any buffer it had asked for without regard for its size such behavior caused no difficulty

18136615
realloc	malloc
code which uses realloc or anything malloc related for that matter will generally not have any control over memory allocation and recycling policy but some implementations of the malloc library may benefit from having code which doesn t need something at the moment but will likely need it in future reallocate it to size zero rather than freeing it

18137457

this table has wine parent and children

18137460
stdout	stderr

i would never ever use post request to do any filtering sorting searching

18137484

min	max
the values for something like gpuimageposterizefilter seem to be way off for me set min to 1 max to 128 and initial to 1

18137498

put	get
basically i get the return value from an nsinvocation and put the returned value at the memory address of arect that afaik should be on the stack

post	get
i would look at providing a series of web services basically these would look like normal http get or post commands to the client that would either respond with xml or json formatted responses the requirements would depend on what you have available on the client i guess you could do both and use a parameter as part of the request to change the format

for-loop	arrays
i figure that the main problem isn t with the arrays nor the splicing though my codes is wrong -but it didn t work even if i commented away those codes but that i place instead of to check bosslife so it keep resetting the level so snowballarray keeps becoming a new arrays hence the array.length didn t work and using sbalength gives some kinda weird error while inside the for-loop

cpu	processors
there are also other reasons to go to a segmented version of the primes sieve other than this and extreme memory use first algorithms that use data that is primarily within the cpu l1 or l2 data caches process faster because of more efficient memory access and secondly because segmentation allows the job to be easily split into pages that can be culled in the background using multi-core processors for a speed-up that can be proportional to the number of cores used

folder	directory
in-case you want to drop a directory and get all the hashes of the files inside you first need to check if you re dealing with a file or a folder if its a folder you loop over all the files inside and call the function for each one which would make your dragdrop event handler look something like this and have the added benefit both files and folder can be taken care of

mouse	keyboard
a javascript based heartbeat based on client s keyboard mouse activity like as answered here or a meta refresh header like as answered here would be the solution if you ve basically a single-page webapp thus you re effectively not using the session scope but the view scope but that won t work nicely if you ve the page open in multiple tabs windows in the same session

getter	setter
i was always told that encapsulation of attributes was good practice only allow access to the private attributes through getter and setter methods

18140897
getter	setter
using getter and setter is always in my opinion good practice

18140897
getter	setter
with a setter and getter you can have a small validation process making sure that the user was not born in the future or is impossibly old

18140897
getter	setter
this minor validation can also enhance code re-usability since you do not need to have to make this check in any other class which invokes these getter and setter

18140956
post	get
i need to get the new post counts that are written after user last viewed the topics

18140965

getter and setter can have additional logic

18141034
getter	setter
it s easier to change class implementation without needless to change public api getter and setter are part of public api

18141047
mutators	setter
mutators setter - public methods that are used to alter the value of an instance variable

18141097
google-chrome	firefox
this issue is in google-chrome and ie not firefox

18141166
getter	setter
if we ll put the puristic view aside we re left with two good reasons to use getter and setter -

18141166
getter	setter
if you already have getter and setter in place - these changes cost you nothing besides the change itself

18141166
getter	setter
it allows you to do implement interfaces which require a getter or setter

18141190

integer	unsigned
if a string of bits represents an integer it can be interpreted as either signed in which case the value can be positive zero or negative or unsigned in which case it s only positive or zero.

18141197
integer	unsigned
in this instance you provided the correct answer for an unsigned integer with an eight-bit word length but the questioner was looking for the value of a signed integer

18141588
width	height
size and more than that height and width window should be resize

18141590

sorting	filtering
i ve developed a joomla frontend data table with paging filtering and sorting

18141888
equals	gethashcode
if you do anything to change the value of gethashcode or equals object you will get undefined behavior

18141888
equals	gethashcode
also if collection does not implement gethashcode and equals object to use the members it contains it will just do a comparison by reference to the container object itself

18141906
integer	unsigned
the driver looks up addresses internally from a memory map using this handle and the internal driver api requires it to be an unsigned integer

18141967
sudo	passwd
somewhere it is configured that the user you are currently logged in as has the rights to do sudo without using a passwd

18141969
freemarker	velocity
therefore just consider switching the view technology at least for the dynamic part to some general-purpose templating library like velocity or freemarker

18141969
freemarker	velocity
then you can write a custom view resolver which would delegate to the appropriate standard resolver velocity freemarker xslt whatever... with the user-selected template

18141970

18142046
quicksort	heapsort
typically they are implemented as introsort which mixes the recursive random-pivot quicksort with heapsort and insertion sort depending on the size of the various recursively sorted sub-ranges

18142110
equals	gethashcode
otherwise default equals gethashcode implementation of the class is used which normally does not have value semantic i.e

18142181
x86	64bit
it could be caused because of the use of 32 bit-exclusive directories like sd program files which is called sd program files x86 on 64bit windows for 32 bit programs registry reflection which causes your program to store registry data under the wow3264node key or even the use of old 16 bit dll s that can not run under wow3264 but that is a very rare case since it is 2013.

18142185
google-chrome	firefox
they could however install firefox or google-chrome if you d include that as a solution which it shouldn t be

18142233
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox

18142240
post	get
these are somewhat obscure methods when compared to the much more used methods like get and post

18142252

18142322
button	checkbox
for firefox on the print dialog there is an advanced or show details button if you click that under appearance there are two checkbox

18142390
width	height
not entirely sure why you would prepend a cloned button into the form with a width 0 and height 0 and no where on the page

18142422
width	text-align
add a span tag around the text then assign a width and text-align center to both the span and input

18142478
hide	show
what i m trying to do using jquery is show a div then delay for the pause value then hide the div

18142507
post	get
you also need to edit your html form which at the moment has a bug you specify form method as get this needs to be post otherwise you ll never get to the block which handles post requests

18142587
put	get
this is because if you just specify a string type the delphi datasnap client will call the method with a get and attempt to put the whole base64 string in the url path causing a connection closed gracefully error

18142587
post	put
using a tjsonobject forces datasnap to use a post and put the data in the content body

18151610
oncreate	recreate
my guess is that this is because activities are stopped when subactivities are called then activites are not recreate oncreate is not called when i return to them

18151627
implements	extends
you could have dataexporterperson extends person or make a new class interface that both dataexporterperson and person extends implements and use that as the type

18151642
width	height
for each of these segments i then add features like the start end of x y axis its height width and so on

18152073
octal	binary
the number 0177 is octal number representing the binary pattern below

18152109
min	max
you need to loop through all z row s and keep a variable for min and max updating them only when larger value or lesser value is found.

18152124
post	get
so now our php will know to call the function nextpage and will also know the current id of the post and increment it by one to get the correct mysql post

18152128
octal	binary
since 0177 is an octal literal and each octal number is 3 three bits you have the following binary equivalents

18152130
for-loop	loops
i want to transfer the control to outer for-loop i loops after if block is executed

18152140
put	get
i tried to put the ajax call within a prototype function as well but i get the same result

18152145
children	parent
the challenge that i am facing is that because so many parent processes fire before all of the children of a particular process are complete child processes seem to be getting queued up in the event loop and it takes a long time for all of the child processes for a particular parent process to resolve and allow garbage collection to clean everything up

18152159
onkeyup	onkeydown
and using the event.getaction call can tell you if it s onkeydown onkeyup etc

18152160
min	max
using with clause and recursion we generate days table with all days between min and max dates

18152199
setinterval	settimeout
maybe instead of using setinterval you should consider switching to settimeout

18152200
put	get
or even better put the strain on the server and reduce the back-and-forth so you get all your keys in one response

18152253
pull	push
whenever i add ignored files for instance if i have examplefolder in my ignore file and i want to push only one file in that folder up to the remote repo it will add the file and then push to the repo but when someone else pull the updated code they will have to go through the same process of forcing those files to be tracked

18152257
dbcontext	objectcontext
you have your dbcontext objectcontext wrapped nicely in a using block but i think that is the problem

18152305
jasmine	sinon
i have to test our backbone project using jasmine and sinon

18152315
int	chars
edited as your comment idname is big int instead of var chars

18152325
submit	submission
when this jsp is rendered after form submission either plain submit or ajax request - doesn t matter and form request has special parameter named filter then fragment instructs displaytag to clear its stored page number etc. and start from first page

18152328
disk	ram
i m looking specifically for attributes about cpu ram disk space video card information browsers available and plug-ins with verson information

18152406
int	double
well if the fraction class has a method to return a double or a float it can be very well constructed with int actually

18152412
for-loop	arrays
then you can use a for-loop with the possible solutions as your length if the result is equal to your optimum team skill then store that result in an arrays

18152424
portrait	landscape
if you d like the linearlayout to not be at the bottom of the screen after a screen rotation you can define both a landscape and portrait xml and android will automatically use the appropriate one based on the orientation at runtime

18152427
int	double
now if you want to use double which will not store exact fractions per se but rather the approximate numbers they represent you have to use double division and not int division as you are currently performing

18152433
setinterval	clearinterval
another problem is i can t use setinterval and clearinterval

18152473
folder	directory
i have saved that as dmoz_spider.py from the idle-shell typing the .py extension in a given folder which corresponds with the directory of the terminal window

18152476
width	margin
i know when we set margin left and right to auto value for an html block element that has a specified width then the element has center position

18152493
min	max
since the max value of an ynumber can only be 2147483647 or -2147483647 for any single number it means that in the worst cases possible p would be the max or min of long

18152493
min	max
for instance a is max long b is max long c is min long and d is 0 then a + c + b d would be the correct combination of operations in order to not use a data type larger than long and we can try a + c because we know c cannot be p since a + b would overflow long maximum possible value of p

18152503
python-daemon	systemd
as i understand python-daemon help to do this and systemd in fedora

18152523

tolower and toupper have pointer-to-string as the receivers but they are returning string not pointer-to-string

18152567
min	max
essentially i have the employee s availability their min max hours and their requested time off

18152578
int	boolean
int occupy more memory than boolean so the heap got corrupted

18152604
jar	war
i would like to separate our projects with other existing jar war ear files that already exist in jboss server default deploy folder

18152646
width	height
the overflow hidden will only work if you give it a set width and height

18152656
integer	fractions
your first snippet will only make sense if your fractions class has a constructor that takes two integer values

18152656
int	double
for your second part of the question your loop will first return an int and then type-cast it to double

18152663
oncreate	onnewintent
try placing this statement in oncreate method so that this statement is executed only once not every time when onnewintent is called

18152727

18152983
google-chrome	firefox
i have my browser firefox google-chrome maximized

18152996
post	get
the only way i managed to get an on_click event so far was to use an html button and use a post or get requests

18153010
width	height
you need to re-evaluate everytime you call this code to get updated width and height values

18153018
min	max
i have tried adding min and max tags to the accumulator used for rolling_mean but that does not give me what i want

18153018
min	max
however the min and max provided here are calculated over the entire accumulator rather than limited to the same rolling window as the mean

18153018
min	max
the boost documentation says that min and max are computed across all samples not limited to a rolling window

18153018
min	max
i would like to be able to report mean min max all across a rolling window

18153018
min	max
i have looked at the documentation for the latest version 1.54.0 and do not see a rolling min max implemented there

18153018
min	max
i don t want to remove values just because they are greater less than the previous min max as that would make the rolling_mean inaccurate

18153020
pull	push
you would only push and pull to and from there

18153020
pull	push
you would do your git add commands and your git pull and git push on there

18153021
width	height
and the result is that the anchor tag has a height and width of 0px so it isn t taking up any space at all and as such isn t making the boxes clickable

18153026
children	parent
the function found the parent of the child div and from there had access to all of its children images

18153026
children	parent
in this way the parent could remove the rotate class from itself and all of its children

18153091
aggregate-functions	sum
using group by meaningful with aggregate-functions such as sum

18153095
matplotlib	scipy
i wish to install python numpy scipy and matplotlib packages

i was able to install and run numpy but not scipy or matplotlib

18153099
width	height
if you d like for it to take up the full div then your containing div should have a width and height and then the link should be set to width 100

18153113
debian	linux
i run debian linux

18153166
width	height
then the area of the triangles between consecutive triangles will all be equal width height 2 0.1 1 2 0.05

18153215
min	max
i don t think an accumulator can do a rolling min max

18153215
min	max	range	max	range	min
it can maintain a min or max with o 1 data because it simply changes the current min max when a number falls outside the range of the current min max

18153218
stdout	stderr
force stdin stdout and stderr to be totally unbuffered

18153218
stdout	stderr
systems where it matters also put stdin stdout and stderr in

18153936
uicontrol	uibutton	inherited	properties
you can play with the contentverticalalignment and contenthorizontalalignment properties of the uibutton inherited from uicontrol

18153960
min	max
for a group containing only one row both min and max would return the same value and as a result datediff would evaluate to 0

18153960
coalesce	isnull
however if you absolutely sure you need the query to return ready-for-display results as in your desired results you ll just need to add two more function calls to each of the two new expressions one cast convert to a varchar and one isnull coalesce to default the null to inprogress

18153962
hide	show
use media queries to hide and show the menus based on screen resolutions

18153989

google-chrome 28 and opera 12 return a getboundingclientrect for the svg element with a width and height of 10

18153989
width	height
firefox 23 reports a width and height of 30

18153993
post	get
--a pushes 2 next a-- pushes 2 again as it is post then a becomes 1 then --a makes first a 0 and then pushes that to and all i guessed that the output would be 0 2 2 but to my surprise it was 0 2 0 then i get it that the final value of a 0 is given to all the places where i used pre increment and decrement

18154026
hide	show
rather than jquery try using css to show hide elements

post	get
i am reviewing a system an old system in which in some cases they send data in a form with post method but they also send parameters to the url as if using get

18154089
post	get
i have read in the comments for this answer that it is perfectly possible and valid to send data from both get and post although the method itself is only either get or post or others in this case is post because that is the way the form defines

18154089
post	get
i ve also played around and saw that if instead of _post or i read the array i get all the variables together but in the case of the duplicated one sesion the post version gets precedence

18154099
postgresql	mysql
there are errors mysql or postgresql

18154099

18154112
folder	directory
the tutorial mentions this in its comment note m2eclipse doesnt seem to pick up on this source folder so you will have to add it manually in eclipse. if you followed the directions at the tutorial the location you need to add should be relative to your project directory

18154134
hash	salt
and then hash the password encoded in utf-16 along with the salt

18154134
hash	salt
header + salt + hash

18154134

18154199
for-loop	arrays
i can t speak to the relative efficiency of this technique compared to a for-loop approach but you could leverage the javascript arrays s slice function for the 2nd dimension not the first

18154200
apache	nginx
you should use apache nginx etc

18154214
hex	binary
binary data should be viewed in hex form third parameter set to false or saved to file and browsed by hex editor

18154220
inherited	properties
this isn t the only way to solve this and inherited trees can get pretty messy when items have multiple different kinds of properties and there are potentially hundreds of slight variations

18154241
post	get
for example if you are using _request then your post values can be overwritten by get which might be a security issue

18154241
post	get
as for why would someone do this it could be an error or a lack of knowledge about the way php get post works

18154241
post	get
the form passes the values from one page to another as post while the action part passes session as get

18154272
post	get
i use query sting parameters get to chose the active page and post values to carry form data

if you re testing off of a local address file whatever your thing is you won t be able to make any http requests by default unless you re in firefox or safari

18154825
base	fractions	fractions	radix
floating point numbers are binary as opposed to decimal so some fractions that are finite in decimal representation but are repeating or transcendental like pi or the base of the natural logarithm e in binary or radix 2

18154843
int	double
this also works for negative numbers and you can also change the int to double if you want to accept floating point numbers

18154887

calloc	malloc
the same in c except the calls are malloc calloc and family

18154912
hash	md5
i am trying to store md5 hash

18154912
hash	md5
md5 hash is not the best choice if security really matters

18154912
hex	binary	hash	md5
however if you will use any hash function consider binary type for it instead md5 will produce 16-byte hash so binary 16 would be enough instead of char 32 for 32 characters representing hex digits

18154927
filtering	grouping
if you mean only the values that occur more than once you can do grouping the key value pairs by value filtering out the grouping with only one item and select the common grouping key original value that appears multiple times from what remains

18154931
stdout	fflush
concerning printf the same as cout holds you re printing into a buffer you need to fflush it with fflush stdout

18155018

non-abstract types deriving from it must still give an implementation for this properties its get accessor

18155102
primes	modulus
an advice about using a primes rather than a composite number without knowledge of the values to hash is not better than claiming 87654321 is the best modulus for hashing

18155102
primes	modulus
if you want to hash primes or fibonacci numbers then advices about using a primes modulus or composite modulus or a power of 2 are irrelevant

18155102
primes	modulus
a primes modulus larger than the largest factor of all the elements of the input set is another good choice

18155102
primes	modulus
this is more likely to occur with the choice of a primes as modulus

decoder	encoder
the rtp packets created by the jm encoder cannot be decoder without the jm software installed

18155435
treemap	linkedhashmap
the order issue is because you are using a map and in java maps are unordered and unsorted type of collection unless you use either linkedhashmap or treemap which cost way more in performance than regular list if you want specific order you must go for list other way the map will always return the values in an unordered way and related to the special characters is because your url contains them and by default the url is coneverted to its encoded version of them since they can only be ascii here is the list of the url encoded characters.

18155477
jasmine	qunit
jasmine is clearly more bdd focused than qunit although i could see doing bdd with qunit by describing the tests in a behavior-oriented way

18155483

because of the way i structure my test in the solution directory they end up being moved around in the drop folder of the build

18155486

i would really love to preserve the layout screen position height and width iconified minimized or not of each internal frame

18155855
width	height
my theory as to why this is the case dialog layout is based on the font size dialog units are a fraction of the font height and average font width

the changes i made plus swapping width and height and changing the ajax json request to hardcoding the data - ajax is hard to get working in fiddle are all at

18156080
getter	setter
this is because obj c creates the ivar for you along with a setter and getter whereas you used to have to synthesize the ivar yourself

18156080
getter	setter
if you manually create the setter and getter however it assumes that you do not want the ivar and so you then have to synthesize it yourself

datamapper	activerecord
as someone who uses datamapper every day at my job i would recommend sticking to activerecord unless you are connecting to a legacy database that you don t control the schema of but i would also consider sequel if that were the case

18156234
datamapper	activerecord
beyond the fact that it is eol as a maintainer stated on the mailing list many gems that need model persistence will support activerecord but it s very rare that they will support datamapper so expect to implement support yourself

put	get	post	get	post	put
now django will set a cookie named csrftoken on the first get request and expects a custom http header x-csrftoken on later post put delete requests

18156756
post	put
for angular it expects the cookie named xsrf-token and will do post put delete requests with x-xsrf-token header so you need to do a little bit tweak to make the two go with each other

18156758
post	get
this will make it so that if your form submits a watermark_url attribute as part of the post params it should automatically get sent to this setter method

now the constraints worked perfectly in both portrait and landscape the uibuttons were at the right positions but the background of my uiview turned black and the background image was gone

18156974
getter	setter
getter and setter can be used to transform values

18156974
getter	setter
that is why java programmers spend half their lives banging out do nothing setter and getter for their private variables--they want to present the setter and getter as their api which allows them to change their code in the future to transform values on the way in or the way out without changing the api

18156974
getter	setter
then ruby came along with the neat attr_accessor method which meant that writing do nothing setter and getter wasn t painful anymore

18156974
getter	setter
the java programmer would then fly over all the towns in the land and drop leaflets describing the getter and setter methods as the api for getting and setting the age instance variable and they would warn people not to access the instance variables directly--or else things might break

18156974
getter	setter
however python has a feature that allows programmers to eliminate getter and setter until they are actually needed to do something useful--rather than dumbly getting or setting a value

matplotlib	scipy
the download page for numpy redirects to the one for scipy which is fine infact i would like to download the rest of scipy as well especially matplotlib but it isn t as important to me as numpy but the scipy download page tells you to get it from even larger packages none of which i can figure out how to use in idle

profiling	instrumentation
now this may just be me speaking when i should keep my mouth shut because i have little insight into the visual studio profiling and i have no idea why if one would want to instrumentation obj binaries rather than bin and therefore i guess i d better describe my train of thought

18157478
metaclass	subclassing
if you re feeling brave you might want to read up on metaclass and see how you could adapt this whole design into use a lotterygamemetaclass so each new class is an instance of that metaclass instead of a subclassing of the abstract base class

18157551
min	max
if p is left of min then we have p min max which means the tuple will evaluate to + 0 - and so the max function will correctly return

18157551
min	max
if p is between min and max then we have min p max which means the tuple will evaluate to - 0 -

width	height
because if you specify the width and the height the browser can preserve that space before downloading the image and continue parsing the html below

18157914
button	checkbox
well if you double click the checkbox you want nothing to happen with the checkbox you just want to pass control up to the button

18157915
width	height
specifying a width and height for all images allows for faster rendering by eliminating the need for unnecessary reflows and repaints

18157915

i m working on a c# dll bind to udk in which you have to return a unsigned 32 bit integer for bool values - hence 0 is false anything greater is true

18158060
post	get
i already know how to set up a form that that post details to the mysql and then a get function to view it on the page

18158137
put	get
and even if i include core.ahk again in main.ahk it is no worry unless it contains subroutines instead of just functions - in which case they get run at the point where they were included so it s best not to put subroutines in your ahk libraries

post	get
if i need to post some code i can but it might get complicated

18158267
filesystems	ntfs
i remember reading about something similar a while back and the error was related to the ntfs filesystems being too fragmented making it impossible to grow files further as the attribute list that stores information about the file allocations would reach its limit

18158302
submit	submission
since your button is a submit button i think it is submission the form after the js is done and this could be the reason why you don t get redirected to test.html as form action attribute doesn t have any value. try the below code for the html form and check if this solves the issue

18158317

this is refered to as the fouc flash of unstyled content and the only solution to my knowledge --when you are dealing with jquery fouc-- is to hide the element with css when it s not yet styled and show it with jquery when you think the flash has finished

alternatively you can use a structure other than a c string such as a counted-array the things that memcpy and memcmp deal with but unless you want to allow 0 bytes in your char array that s usually too much work

18159460
equals	compareto
if you would like whole data pair to be used as an identifier then it would be more reasonable to use hashset as it requires only to define when objects are equals while treeset as an ordered data structure requires some kind of ordering that you declare with compareto method

18159482
pop-up	dialog
that license notice will pop-up even if you are not using the wp dialog for voice recognition

hex	binary
the image files are getting included in your diff as indicated by the lines with --- and +++ but they are included as whole files in the patch - this is due in part the the problem of how to meaningfully display changes in binary data such as images in a text only format - unless you would like pages of hex differences such as fc -b a.gif b.gif would produce

18159782
pascal	delphi
however one specific problem you will run into with delphi pascal in solving this problem is that delphi does not support fixed point decimal arithmetic it does scientific notation through the fpu which is good enough for scientific applications not for accounting ones which means you will need to come up with a solution around that the currency type works sometimes it will work here

18166838
width	height
this one gives me centered text but the link only covers the width of the cell not the height

18166847
width	height
in this example the properties x y width height of kinetic.group and kinetic.image are set with normal number values

18166847
width	height
my problem is that i need this properties as variables because my uploaded images have different values for height width etc

18166847
width	height
with number values for x y width height it works all

18166851
salt	md5
brute force and hacking can be taken care of by that i mean best you can with the usual tried and tested security approaches using a proper login system with bcrypt blowfish random salt per user or similar standard for passwords not md5 or sha and with users made to choose at least x chars one uppercase and a number using pdo mysqli correctly and before doing anything at all with any user input validate it all with with strlen is_numeric some regex to get rid of bad chars etc

18166859

in the while loops you overwrite all the four variables each time thus only the last one will be displayed in your for-loop

18167149
hide	show
depending on how the user interacts with the view i need to show one layer and hide all others

18167149
hide	show
partially to avoid this but also because i have the impression that opacity changes can affect performances i m wondering if changing opacity is actually the best way to hide and or show calayers should i consider changing the zposition or changing its position so that it no longer appears on screen

18167179
sorting	filtering
also you already have a natural sorting algorithm but if you want one that s already designed to be used as an angular filtering module i wrote one

versioning	upgrade
so if this code is available to the public a drastic change will make it awkward for people if using to upgrade to another versioning

18167298
inline	inlining
you ve got a lot of inline code in the loops here - while inlining does help performance it makes it a lot more difficult to get useful data out of a profiler - hence my next step after making the zend-free and reducing the concurrency would be to structure the code into functions and profile it

18167401
ienumerable	iqueryable
in linq-to-sql it worked fine but in ef i can t make it run the problem is when i add the tvf to the model through some tricks since ef designer does not support it the result of tvf is not iqueryable but an ienumerable so i can t return it in wcf data service

18167410
folder	directory
instead since you are really just looking for a guaranteed known location you probably want to have your build products copy to a folder inside the project directory itself

18167410
folder	directory
add a copy files build phase at the end of the and copy the built products from the standard build products directory to a known subfolder of the main project folder

18167410
folder	directory
set dstroot to srcroot install_path to a named directory inside your project s folder and set deployment_location to 1

18167441
apache	nginx
yea it s possible but there s a trick the server has both apache and nginx installed nginx listens to port 80 and apache listens on any other port nginx would serve the assets directly css js html etc and pass the php or whatever app it is to apache reduces the load on apache a bit but consumes a little bit more memory because you have 2 servers running

my problem is as follows - i have a custom pageradapter i made to handle cursors and get a whole bunch of data from my database and put it into a view

18167631
put	get
here s what i get from what i read - every transaction - put get delete is saved as keyvalue in the memstore and then written off to storefiles hfiles on flushing

18167631

18167895
put	get
status codes make no contract that future requests will return the same code a 200 response to the put does not mean a subsequent get can t return 403

18167895
put	get
if it was the client should issue a subsequent get rather than expecting the new representation to be sent in response to the put if for no other reason than to update any caches along the way because the response to a put is not cacheable

18168006
int	chars
which means i could compress up to a 36 6 2.17 billion range with 6 chars just enough to compress the positive range of a 32 bit int

18168006
int	chars
assuming the toekenizer recognized every code point above 128 one could encode 99.6 of the 32 bit int range in 4 bytes and the full range in 5 2 unicode16 bit chars + 1 8 bit alphanumeric

18168014
post	get
i just want to send some simple get post with the chained proxies

18169719
for-loop	arrays
if you re just trying to populate one arrays based on some calculation which isn t based on an existing collection an enhanced for-loop isn t helpful

18169719
for-loop	arrays
even if you do want to populate the arrays based on another collection using an enhanced for-loop isn t ideal as you don t have any concept of an index

18169723

pull	push
if someone pulled your erroneous branch then you force push the correct change set on the branch that may cause havoc on their history and on any changes they made on top of the branch because their pull will no longer be fast forward unless they fix their erroneous branch with force pull or if they rebase their changes which could mean that they might reintroduce the erroneous changes again

18169783
for-loop	arrays
you can however use an enhanced for-loop to assign values to another arrays like so

memcpy	memmove
from reading other so questions such as this or this gives the impression that memcpy should work faster than memmove and intuitively this should be so

18176857
memcpy	memmove
however when measuring the time spent inside of each function memmove beats memcpy

18176857
memmove	memset	memcpy	memset	memcpy	memmove

noexcept	throw
calling std terminate as it would happen if a noexcept function throw std bad_alloc seems to be reasonable in that case

i guess the safest recommendation is to never use noexcept if a std bad_alloc exception could be throw

18177063
post	get
i m using restkit to interact with my webserver api get post etc.

18177073
noexcept	throw
if a function can throw an exception for whatever reason even if it is std bad_alloc you should not declared it as noexcept

18177073
noexcept	throw
the primary need for noexcept functions is to allow the detection of the available error recovery options in case of an exception for example can use move construction when inserting an object assuming that move construction doesn t throw

18177073
noexcept	throw
in particular do not use noexcept as false documentation it is a breach of contract if the function actually can throw

clicking - dash in firefox says that event.which is 173 while doing the same in google-chrome produces 189

18177854

alternatively to do this for a fixed width that wraps to an arbitrary height you would need to calculate height with the following code rather than attributedsubstring.size.height and then possibly subtract a little to account for wanting to show the last line that of the substring

set the width to 100 and the height to whatever static height you d like

18178171

18181635
min	max
if you re setting min max values higher

18181635
min	max
i would recommend to run or at least integration test with min max since booting a runtime on demand might be costly yet again this is application dependent and at the same time it s harder to guess your memory requirement when you boot up a rails instance on demand while serving

it seems most of the modern android devices now check that a surfaceview exists and has a non-zero width and height my samsung galaxy sii spews warnings in such a circumstance and won t capture the photo

18184354
width	height
interestingly if the surfaceview has a width and height of 1dip then it works just fine

18184354
width	height
with a width and height of 1 pixel the surfaceview is incredibly difficult to see and whilst it works it still falls into the category of security issue

18184442
octal	hex
assuming you have a character code that is a degree sign on your display with a custom display i wouldn t necessarily expect it to live at the common place in the extended ibm ascii character set or that the display supports unicode character encoding then you can use the encoding nnn or xhh where nnn is up to three digits in octal base 8 or hh is up to two digits of hex code

18184442
octal	decimal
unfortunately there is no decimal encoding available - dennis ritchie and or brian kernighan were probably more used to using octal as that was quite common at the time when c was first developed

18184465
affinity	processors

if you want to keep the size of images fixed u can simply use css to keep width and height fixed also you can set the position as fixed which will help you to to keep the image from movement

18184712
gdi	directdraw
fonts are probably the most difficult thing to use because there is surprises in font themselves there is so many new standards that supposed to solves everything and just confuse more because almost no font support it at 100 even some classic font have partial bad information in them the gdi gdi+ directdraw don t draw font at the same position in pixels because of math coordinate rounding anti-aliasing.

folder	directory
the code below is to run through a folder which contains several files ending _perms.txt which defines the permissions of directory based on that user name

18184846
folder	directory
the possible solution is that you need to set read attributes on any parent directory to where your tmp folder is to make it work

18184846
777	tmp
i would recommend creating a tmp in home tmp setting chmod 777 to both home and tmp

18185033
128bit	64bit
like tea xtea is a 64bit block feistel network with a 128bit key and a suggested 64 rounds

18185043
ng-show	ng-include
this should be done by lazy loading the template dom for the details because the template is very large and i ve got many items in the list so a ng-show with ng-include is not working since it is compiled into the dom and makes the performance very bad

18185122
docx	.doc
first fileuploader is for .doc or docx file and second one is for ppt or pptx file

18185127
tunnel	packets
as webrtc is built in the browser and it s the browser internals that creates the tunnel and encodes the stream in vp8 you don t have access to the raw stream to encode it using other codec neither to the raw connection to send the packets after your custom encoding

18185127
google-chrome	firefox
to allow webrtc to use h264 the browsers need to have support for it native or plugin-based and actually google-chrome and firefox don t support it

18185150
google-chrome	firefox
the reason this is happening is because firefox renders the select box as a taller element than google-chrome and the container of the blue text is getting caught on the select s container element because it s now sticking out lower than the others

18185156
pascal	delphi
though i m not limiting this list to other products turbo pascal free pascal lazarus kylix c# builder borland pascal turbo pascal for windows etc my first goal is to get the delphi list complete

multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	subtract
the answer there is simply that 26820.0 does have an exact binary representation and the multiplication operation is smart enough to spot that - even multiplying by 1001.0 and subtract 26.82 would still get you an exact answer

18185227
width	height
here is the css code that i am trying to change the height of the element wrapper according to the device s height as well the width

width	height
if i have an image of set n x m width and height then load the ckeditor then the width and height are discarded and the image is set to it s default size

18185631
128bit	64bit
or on architectures with a very wide address range 64bit or even 128bit relative addressing will lead to more compact code because one can use 16 bit or 8 bit for relative addresses but absolute addresses must always be 64bit or 128bit

18185697
put	get
every time you do a get put you will take a big runtime hit for this though

18185704
sorting	filtering
since i might handle large results i never considered sorting or filtering in my views or view models

18185704
stateless	stateful
originally i thought about performing any query with a repository acting as a collection-like interface but now i am noticing that a view model may also behave as stateful collection-like interface while the former are stateless collection-like interfaces

18185793
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested on firefox google-chrome and ie

18185901

18185972
getter	setter
for instance if you want to inject a mock into a class without using a framework you need some way to to that either by adding getter setter pass it to the constructor or use public variables

18185972
getter	setter
this is still possible without using a framework for example by adding a getter and setter so that you can set the object a in your testclass

18185972
getter	setter
then you do not need to have setter getter for your mocked objects which will give you cleaner code

18185996
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it works

18186004
width	height
a workaround would be setting width and height to each slider image manually through css

18186154
ienumerable	iqueryable
i have an extension method that can operate on both ienumerable and iqueryable

18186154
ienumerable	iqueryable
this method works on an iqueryable but it returns an ienumerable

18186154
ienumerable	iqueryable
note the accepted answer is correct about the danger of chaining but i d like to add that implementing the iqueryable method and calling it from the ienumerable one so simply switching things around is safe

18186168

2- then there are three places where you should put your path variable so that you post it to upload.class.php whenever you request it

18187791
translation	localization
in other localization systems like android string resources or rails yaml files it works like you imagined -- the equivalent to a msgid is a single key even for plurals but then the real phrase is not used in the source code and defining translation is a two-steps action even for the original language

but most likely you will only need to address internet explorer and pretty much rest of the browsers like google-chrome firefox opera etc handle the websites quite similarly

18188354
put	get
if you re looking at more advanced use cases anything beyond just get and put then check out an in-memory datagrid imdg solution such as oracle coherence

18188355
height	border-box	width	border-box	width	height
border-box means the size of an element is its height width and its padding

18188355

in theory this also leaves open the possibility that the system could do something smart here like picking a bufsize based on the block size for the file s filesystem or even based on running stats data although it doesn t look like linux glibc freebsd or os x do anything other than use a constant

18194908
for-loop	arrays
there is no iterative waiting for-loop and only one async task being launched per arrays of lines that you have

thus i do not do any null pointer check when i loops in the enhanced for-loop

18195206
hide	show
simple just make sure you set your uitableviewdelegate and you can use heightforrowatindexpath and similar for headers and footers to show hide the cells by setting their height to 0

18195206
hide	show
then just define some logic within your ibaction to change these bools around in between tableview s begin end updates and the table will show hide the sections you want

18195211
int	double
in case of multi-level type parameters the outer list is a concrete instantiation of because the type of elements is known to be a list at compile time although the inner list is a wildcard instantiation as the type of elements stored can be int double any subclass of number

min	max	range	max	range	min
otherwise for an enumeration where e min is the smallest enumerator and e max is the largest the values of the enumeration are the values in the range b min to b max defined as follows let k be 1 for a two s complement representation and 0 for a one s complement or sign-magnitude representation

18195408
min	max
b max is the smallest value greater than or equal to max |e min | âˆ k |e max | and equal to 2 m âˆ 1 where m is a non-negative integer

18195408
min	max
b min is zero if e min is non-negative and âˆ b max + k otherwise

18195408
min	max
fortunately your enum s smallest enumerator is so max |e min | âˆ k |e max | is equal to |e max | in any case which is

18195408
range	max
i think the intent is to allow the range to extent in 1-bit-steps. it follows that b max is 3 and bmin is 0

18195467
int	boolean
when i was trying to create a method public boolean equals int i

18195491

hide	show
as soon as i add the code to hide the panels and show them one by one the selected value is not there

18195805
range	median
as an example the approach of sorting and then performing a binary search on the extremes of your range and then directly computing the median will be useful when the number of range you have to test is greater than log n

18195805
range	median
on the other hand if the number of range is smaller than log n it may be better to move elements of a given range to the beginning of the array and use a linear time selection algorithm to find the median

18195808
cpu	processors
libraries usually contain the code compiled for the target processors cpu or gpu - hence you need to compile it through nvcc

obviously i already installed node with nvm and since this code runs in context of applications so i tested node -v command surely works with path setting on zsh and bash

i configured proguard in maven pom.xml

18202261
put	get
if i just put it in the spec i get an error for method not found

18202261
put	get
to get it working i put include actiondispatch testprocess in my spec but i have found since i did that that guard is not correctly reloading spec files when i make changes it keeps running the tests against the old version of the files

18202330
width	height
the other approach would be to instantiate the text test how large it is and split it up into multiple textgeometry instances if it is larger than your maximum desired width offset on the y-axis by the height

18202330
min	max
bounding boxes have min and max properties which are vectors representing opposite corner vertices so you can get the dimensions of a geometry along a given axis by calling

18202338
width	height
i wrapped the input boxes in divs and assigned width and height to the divs instead of the input boxes

18202347
hide	show
for example show and hide the extra text using javascript by dynamically setting the contents of an element with the aria-live attribute set to polite which makes the screen reader read out the help text presented or just hiding and showing the extra text which should just be beneath the line that has the question mark in it when a click happens on the question mark

width	height
there are some caveats to this approach - invisible sprites cannot capture mouse events and they cannot have their width height set programmatically only by adding children at appropriate positions

18202883
width	height
the case i have an image container with 400x400 but the image i want to show is 400x1200 so i can only display 400 in height at the time but the width would be constant

strlen	strcpy
if token is null then both strlen and strcpy will most likely crash

18204513
width	height
can be set to specific height and width or be set to auto so that they grow in size with the text

18204513
width	height
can also be set to a fixed height and width but also have scrollbars switched on to allow content to expand

18204557
int	boolean	public	protected
some tweaking i haven t tried this but i would strip all public protected static code everyone that references those methods variables uses java.awt.eventqueue anyway and so can you add the size variable and update this variable in the following four methods postevent awtevent int getnexteventprivate getnextevent int and removesourceevent object boolean

effectively i m going for something akin to the microsoft mouse and keyboard program

18205047
implements	extends
as for the cookies what i did to keep using urlconnetion which is the default use case for volley on api 8 is to implements a custom class that extends hurlstack volley s implementation of an http client using urlconnection and overriding createconnection url url which is the method used to get a connection prior to every request

18205099
mergesort	heapsort
based on the wikipedia article for sorting algorithms it appears that the heapsort and mergesort all have identical time complexity o n log n for best average and worst case

18205099
mergesort	heapsort
mergesort has the disadvantage that its memory complexity is o n whereas heapsort is o 1

18205099
mergesort	heapsort
on the other hand mergesort is a stable sort and heapsort is not

18205099
mergesort	heapsort
so based on that i would choose heapsort in preference to mergesort if i didn t care about the stability of the sort so as to minimise memory usage

18205108

svg	vml
they use various techniques and offer various features so you ll need to evaluate them yourself to determine which is most suitable to your situation but most of them ultimately convert the svg to vml as a fall-back for old ie

18205220
svg	vml
one or two of them also use other technologies flash silverlight etc to do the conversion which may be a good thing since vml can be slow and also because ie isn t the only old browser still in use that doesn t support svg eg android 2.3 and earlier

18205240

18205468
ceil	floor
there is another useful function in this context math.round which is ceil and floor combined

18205468
int	double
please note that these methods will return double so you ll need to cast them to get int

18205472
int	double
math.ceil - returns the smallest closest to negative infinity double value that is not less than the argument and is equal to a mathematical int

18205472

your best bet would be to use a viewpager.onpagechangelistener and show and hide the actionmode in onpageselected .. if the page selected isn t the one with the actionmode hide the actionmode

18205760
getter	setter
by you declare an explicit getter an implicit setter and an implicit ivar

18205760
getter	setter
however there is no need that a getter setter use the automatic ivar not even an ivar at all

18205760
getter	setter
if you want a protected private ivar declare the ivar in that way and write your own getter setter

18205769
width	height
the height and width of the tree structure can be larger than screen bounds

18205775

18205960
folder	directory
if you want to also load files that are place in the future in this folder you have to add to your load instructions a line that will match all files and that will make the super.load implementation to create a directory watcher for that you should then maybe override createdirectorywatcher to not watch the files already present in the folder when load is called

18205962
for-loop	arrays
so i ve went for using importdata after all using a for-loop creating a cell containing a structured arrays for each subject and trial

browser firefox google-chrome

18206311
for-loop	arrays
here if you look at the for-loop arrays length is calculated for every iteration that degrades

by providing only one layout though you re most likely going to have it optimized for phone or tablet sized screens

18216496
screens	tablet
if you create it for phones then tablet will probably have a lot of empty space whereas creating another set of layouts would allow you to put extra info on the screens than the phone layouts could fit

18216512
rspec	capybara
i have a bunch of rspec tests and roughly 30 of those are headless tests through capybara poltergeist

18216536
udp	tcp
tcp and udp channels have very different restrictions on what can be changed and when because tcp channels use a handshake protocol to build a connected session between two ports whereas udp has no such restriction at all

18216536
udp	tcp
in return tcp channels can be regarded as reliable streams whereas udp is not a streaming protocol at all and has no sessions connections

18216576
spaces	delimiter
since you are not doing any complex text pattern matching just taking the first column delimiter by a spaces you can use some of the utilities which are column-based such as awk or cut

18216592
width	height
recursion stops when a width or a height reaches zero

18216596
screens	tablet
but the problem iam facing when i test my game on a phone with reso 320 480 with screens size 3 inch the character seems to move fast but while testing it on tablet character move slowly

18216615
put	get
great that worked......well not really as for some reason the very specific route completely breaks the put method with always now returns a 405 and i can t get around it

18216691

18216723
put	get
no matter where i put the code i can t get the index of the row that was is will be deleted

18216734
put	get
there is 3 columns in one row i m looking at the source code and they make it with the row tag and then they put a span tag i follow these and get a different result like this

18216738
width	height
i want for example to measure the width height padding of element on the image so that i can convert it to css

18216806

18216850
portrait	landscape
in the code of my site then 1 vw viewport width after rotating device from landscape to portrait or vice versa doesn t update

18216853
unsigned	short	int	chars
now to translate this into carbon-unit speak proto_type is declared as a function that takes a long int and a pointer to a chars as parameters it returns a pointer to a function that takes a pointer to a const chars and an unsigned short int and that function returns a void pointer

18216870
serializable	deserialization
my assumption for 2.x was that the dominant use case was for mix-ins to apply to both serializable and deserialization and most common method then was to add them directly via objectmapper or using module methods

18216870
serializable	deserialization
i don t know off-hand how easy it would be to add support back in but it s worth suggesting if it is something you really need.the challenge at implementation level is that mix-ins are a fundamental feature that must be set before any actual serializable or deserialization since it affects the way serializable deserializers are built

18217014
vbo	vao
from most tutorials i have seen you generate the vao first then the vbo and then the ibo but in others they changed the order and it seemed to work.

18217026
folder	directory
the demo works fine it also works in my cakephp project when i place the server folder from the plugin in my cakephp webroot directory

18217040
width	height
if you want to make only the height exactly fit within the image view you need to do a little math to find out the proper width ratio

18217040
width	height
you always want the height to be whatever maxheight is and you ve done math to find out the new width that is proportional to the original image size when height maxheight

18217040
width	height
pass that height and width to the function in that answer

18217057
int	chars
chars + chars returns an int so the compiler complains that which is indeed wrong

18217069
children	parent
an error is thrown if invalid children are added to a parent for example when adding a layer to another layer

18217070
n-gram	words
since the grammar is finite whether it is jsgf or n-gram i am not able to make sphinx recognize every possible words or sentence

18217108
int	chars
the first line of code tells the compiler that you are adding 2 chars or int which should result in an int and not a string

18217113
int	chars
as such the operator + is defined to mean addition of two chars with an int result

18217145
put	get
if you put one more end here you wouldn t get the error.but you would get then another- syntax error unexpected keyword_end expecting end-of-input due to the below

18217166
int	chars	int	double
it s because string + chars string similar to how an int + double double

18217166
int	chars
chars + chars is int despite what the other answers tell you

18217263
children	parent
i tried adding a function to all children of the div which gets called but the parent onclick is still being triggered

18217439
post	get
when i post a text everything works fine but on quote post i get a bad request error

18217477
post	get
you can still keep auto return set to on but make sure you disable pdt and you will get all the transaction variables sent to your return url via post if you have the rm parameter set to 2 in your request of course as you said you have

18217483
ready	each
as you can see this waits for the dom to be ready then on each load it executes the code

google-chrome	firefox
i have previously successfully tested this mvc functionality in my app in google-chrome but have recenlty also tested in ie 10 and firefox

18217489
google-chrome	firefox
when i mash the submit button on a page which sends model values to its controller for running a query and generating a report it now works only in firefox each of the three browser indeed have their own peculiar characteristics -- where they shine or dull in relation to their cohorts gleaming in purple and gold -- but google-chrome and firefox seem to have lost the connection between the submit button s click handler and the corresponding controller s method

18217572
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
im experiencing the following issue with ie10 other browsers like firefox opera google-chrome and older ie versions do not seem to be affected

on top of that i wanted the text to fadeout fadein and then fadeout again to give it a flashing effect before it disappeared

18217628
mouse	keyboard
this event stream can be in the form of input mouse keyboard etc where the user enters data to the system and expects feedback in the form of output voice vibration visual etc when the system responds

18217628
mouse	keyboard
for example in todayâ s interaction the computer ignores typed information through a keyboard when a mouse button is depressed

18217677
youtube	vimeo
works on youtube vimeo

18217705
setinterval	settimeout
you ve written a lot of code that shows you are capable so i m just going to point you at checking out setinterval or settimeout rather than trying to piece all that together for you

18217725
src	attr
this attr src my.gif

18217813
hide	show
the main issue to me is that if you hide it in the css and then use javascript to show it visitors without javascript enabled will not be able to view the content

18217831
inherited	properties
which isn t working because i lose my test2 prototype method properties when i add the inherited from my parentconstructor

18217856
post	get
should it be done using two separate controller methods one for post and one for get or handled together in one

18217856
post	get
in the routes file there are two routes defined ensuring post is above get so that it takes precedence both pointing to the same method

18217871
fadein	fadeout
you need to use the animate function here before you were just setting the padding-left to 0 which happens immediately and you have to fix your fadeout and fadein callback functions

18217912
folder	directory
and the windows explorer view of the file system also does not show any folder named bin within the tomcat7 folder in the directory hierarchy associated with the workspace

18217941
textview	imageview
the easiest solution however would be to create a 9-patch for your background drawable ditch the imageview and apply that to your textview

18217982
peer	p2p
assume a p2p network in which peer independently try to find and connect to good nodes

18217985
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
you could also just use uibutton s to mimic the behavior of a uisegmentedcontrol

18217986
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
this library provides equivalent memory allocation functions malloc calloc free optimized for parallel applications

18218016
newtype	either
the standard way around this such as in the monoid class for numeric types that could provide either a summation or product depending on how you define the monoidal operator you want to use is to provide newtype wrappers over the concrete type that you want the class to have different instances for

18218020
dictionary	map
as reed noted you could have a dictionary or a map of some sort which is reasonable

18218020
width	height
in order to process these two some part of your code will have to know what to do with width and height and it will also need to know what to do with model and color

18218021
for-loop	loops
also it currently uses a for-loop which means the asynchronous api call within loops never gets run

18218032
ffmpeg	libav
as of 2013-07-29 commit c44191039944526dd7eb6e536990b555837961f5 libav ffmpeg have supported version 3 of the protocol

18218048
cos	sin
you can use a loop with sin and cos to generate the points

18218060
addition	multiplication
if you know the data and the height of rows headers footers it s a simple matter of multiplication addition

18218061
width	height
i thought about using a viewbox around a canvas which had its width and height set to 830 x 580 ratio correct for a5 however this didn t help

18218065
inherited	properties
setting up inherited should take place before you define new properties on the prototype of childconstructor

18218082
getter	setter
a good and easy way to restrict the value of a field in any object is to make sure that all fields are only accessible via getter and setter and have the setter perform any validation or adjustments

18218091
post	get
usually get and post does quite other things therefore it will be more comfortable for you if you ll do it with typical rest approach

18218106
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome and people use it all the time for running head-less js tests so you can probably find a lot more information out there for it than for that .net thing you mentioned

18218117
put	get
you can get the required result using a single regexp which extract the keys and the values and put the result inside a hash table

18218133
width	height
so i have decided the best route would be to stack two container divs on top of each other each with a width of 100 and height of 50

18218133
width	height
then i would split these into two div classes each with a height of 100 width of 50 thus giving me 2 divs per container div which are 2 in number

18218156
width	margin
assigning width 25 to each div will get your 4 divs on the same row counting there are no borders and or margin padding on the exterior

18218199
background-image	background-position
when using sprites in compass sass you get a background-image and a background-position generated

18218212
hide	show
the id of this input is tied to a javascript function hide show two divs therefore i can t change the id to be the same for happy.js

18218213
tunnel	vpn
however this needs to be changed to tunnel into the private vpn

18218286
memcpy	strcpy
to do this with a character array as you have you need to do a strcpy or memcpy from the product family name to your id byte array as c doesn t support direct array assignment as far as i know

18218362
google-chrome	firefox
when i load the page i get uncaughtsyntax error unexpected token o in google-chrome and in firefox i get syntax error unexpected character

18218383
jobs	cron
that is possible by setting up a cron jobs on your server

18218430
hide	show
so as long as you are not planning this sort of scheme and you re just doing a normal hide show of user-friendly content you will be fine

18218443
accessor	properties
i found in oracle doc that when the initiallobfetchsize properties is set to a nonzero value the getoracleblob getoracleclob getoracleblobforupdate and getoracleclobforupdate typed accessor methods are disabled

18218468
width	height
here is what i did instead where of course the xy center are my own coordinates with respective width and height based on the image over which i plotted the ellipse

18218514
charindex	substr
then there is very little to do except using the substr and charindex functions

18218518
touchesbegan	touchesended
the reason the subview does not get the touchesended event is that it has not received the touchesbegan event these two come in pairs - whichever view gets the touchesbegan is going to get the touchesended

18218528
implements	extends
is there any way to extends hashset to implements this behaviour or should i some other data structure

18218529

18218712
post	put
i can t put the url links to the latter code in because i don t have enough rep to post more than two f links

18218753
int	chars
it is faster to use an int because an int is easily stored in binary 1 s and 0 s computers understand these a lot better than they do chars of any language

18218753
int	chars
an index of the variable chars type would have at the most 38 bytes more data to index if you need all those extra indexes then it would make sense but an int already holds so many possible values

18218755
viewdidload	viewdidappear
what i found out that if there could be a big delay about 20 seconds to 50 seconds to load up the screen after the methods viewdidload and viewdidappear of that screen are called

18218766
typedef	struct
i have a typedef d struct declared in one header

18218766

18218915
folder	dir
or heat dir folder .

18218915
folder	directory
i have looked at harvesting multiple directory in wix but the first answer is too much manual work we re lookong for almost complete automation and the second answer puts everything in one file under one componentgroup which would be a maintenance nightmare as we have thousands of files and dozens of folder and sub-folders to be installed

18218937

i think that is not always right you cannot protect your code against yourself or your development team just adding keywords in fact there are lots of languages which donâ t have any const public private protected internal int float double keywords and that doesnâ t mean they are not good languages

18221849

what you have stored in the database is hash real_password + salt

18222249

18236969
children	parent
the child upon completing its task deletes its row in the table freeing the parent to create more children

18236969
children	parent
and since the parent and child never communicate beyond the parent starting the child i can t detect from the parent when a child fails otherwise i could immediately try and start any failed children again instead of rerunning the parent post-hoc

thus it produced interesting query once i decided to fetch the whole aggregate i mean parent with all children

now in your click handler whenever you perform an ajax operation the busy wait read loading element will show when it starts and hide when the ajax operation ends

18238957
hide	show
since you do not want to show a loading message when ajax operations occur but rather when the button is clicked and then hide the message when the popup is done fading in then i recommend the jquery blockui plugin

18238996
put	get
if i take out the following line of code the the only error i get is payroll.form1.submit_click object system.eventargs must declare a body because it is not marked abstract extern or partial if i put the body back in then i get 22 errors

many-to-many	one-to-many
i used to have a one-to-many relationship has_many belongs_to but i wanted to open it up to a many-to-many relationship where i could store variables about the relationship

use jquery s contains selector 1 to select nodes that match your search criteria and show them then hide the rest

18239064
hide	show
given that you want to search through elements with the class .accordion and show or hide them you do this

18239317
button	checkbox
so i click on the button layout and i can activate or desactivate layout by checking a checkbox

18239345
width	height
you didn t specify px in the new height and width and in jsfiddle you have to wrap it in head section

18239413
int	chars	int	double
in your case your struct has 5 int fields 4 bytes each a single chars field 1 byte a single double field 8 bytes and a 48 chars array

cpython	pypy
instead of using cpython to translate this code to cpu instructions and execute it you could also use pypy

18239474
httprequest	httpresponse
i don t want directly use httprequest and httpresponse

18239476
getter	setter
i have one class that has a global variable called score that is private and i have getter and setter methods for it

18239527
post	get
of course to make a copy of it you have to copy it into memory you own which you could get from malloc strlen testy2 +1 or or as you ve done in your original post by creating a local allocation

18239527
free	malloc
if you used malloc or new to dynamically allocate space for your copy of the string literal and assigned the returned address to a pointer let s say testy2 then don t assign the return of strstrip to that pointer or else you can t later use the pointer to free the dynamically allocated memory

18239527
free	malloc
when you call free or delete you need to pass it the original pointer you got from malloc or new not the pointer you got back from strstrip

18239541
division	multiplication
the task is given to the function as list 3 + 4 15 and should be solved by regarding that multiplication and division have to be prefered

prepare	execute	inject	interceptor
without this helper interceptor you could always intercept a session object by implementing sessionaware see how do we get access to the session and initialize the properties somewhere when the action is execute prepare method because it s comming after the session map is inject

18239589
width	height
i have not experience in wpf but in silverlight width and height values are of type double

18239662
getter	setter
attributes is a property of cactiverecord and yes it has getter and setter method

18239668
post	get
one way to get around this problem according to this post is to do something like this

18239681
integer	unsigned
how the compiler knows that the data type is a unsigned int or signed int if we declared a variable with signed integer type or unsigned integer type

18239690
submit	submission
but i want to perform validation on the form for empty fields before submission so i tried to use the jquery validate plugin but my form does not submit through ajax if i do so

18239703
post	get
after the initial post fails data is resent as get

18239717
post	get
it mather when you have form items text box checkbox or if you want to send information through post instead of get

18239760
setinterval	settimeout
if you do not have access to the constructor and or you cannot pass it a callback then presumably the only and sad option would be to use a settimeout or easier setinterval continuously checking at defined intervals if the operation has been completed and then fire the callback

18239795
addition	multiplication
this helps with performance but not so much because two operations are encoded in a single instruction â it helps with performance because the virtually infinite precision of the intermediate result is sometimes important and very expensive to recover with ordinary multiplication and addition when this level of precision is really what the programmer is after

18239795
cpu	processors
on most processors this approach means changing the rounding mode three times and each change is expensive it involves flushing the cpu pipeline

18239795
addition	multiplication
an algorithm due to veltkamp and dekker computes this function with only double-precision addition and multiplication reference

18239795
addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	addition
examples where fma is used for its precision and not only as an instruction that does a multiplication and an addition are the computation of square root and division

18239796
post	get
well per the http spec post in this case your form submission is for changing data and get in this case your link is for retrieving data

jar	war
i don t know where to look if logback is in the classpath but i can see logback jar files when running goal package and looking into web-inf lib of the created war file

18239847
post	get
when a browser is asked to make a cross domain request with a method other than get head or post the browser will first send an options request with a access-control-request-method header for the method in question

18239847
post	get
requests outside of get head or post are termed preflighted requests

18239847
put	get
if you want to only have one request and actually need the put request to get to the server i d recommend serving the page making the request from the same domain to avoid cors altogether

18239869
width	height
so lets just say you have the values 1 2 3 for height length and width respectively

18239938

it is not working properly in ipad safari and ipad google-chrome browser - i tried all advices that i found on web - but i found no solution to my case

18239961
post	get
single controller function but some get post parameter and big if else branching

18239978
screens	tablet
yes use the different folder for supporting different screens sizes to put a layout specific to a 7 tablet

18239987
post	get
i have 2 get post sets and that is the only signficant difference in the json

18239989
hide	show
if this is all in one activity and you want to show hide a layout from a different xml file then you will first need to inflate that layout so you have a reference to it

18239989
hide	show
if it is going from one activity to another then you can simply check the state of the checkbox in your onclick and send some type of extra data in your intent to check in the next activity to know to show hide the layout
