6241752
post	get
i want to send three values with post not get

6241791
jmx	sigar
you would need to use a library like sigar source is at github that can gather those values and then expose the return values of sigar via jmx

6241833
google-chrome	firefox
my site is and it s background images didn t loaded too in google-chrome but it showed fine on firefox

6241844
calloc	malloc
i used calloc instead of malloc to get cgpoints initialized with 0.0

6241846
int	chars
the only checking you can do is checking that all the chars in the string are in the valid range and check for overflow test if the value returned is the maximum int - unreliable

6241863
disk	ram
of course i don t want to keep all the images in the ram - i need to create a small cache of images in the ram and write the images that i don t need right now to the disk

6241929
int	chars
note that getchar returns an int not a chars

6241930
requestfactory	gwt-rpc
if you decide to go that route you should look into using requestfactory to communicate with your server instead of gwt-rpc which is java-specific

6241937
folder	directory
this creation of temporary folder under user s temp directory and extraction of content took initial time

6242001

6242200
rar	zip
as such they are just containers for a bunch of files just like zip tar rar etc

i would recommend making the main window a jframe and using either a jdialog or joptionpane for most of the other elements

6242236
jtabbedpane	jsplitpane	jinternalframe	jsplitpane	jinternalframe	jtabbedpane
alternately multiple gui elements can be added into a single space in a number of ways - cardlayout jtabbedpane jsplitpane jdesktoppane jinternalframe

6242265
viewdidload	dealloc
b i note in my logs after this point that appointmentlistcontroller viewdidload seems to get called before the previous appointmentlistcontroller dealloc method is called like i was in controller a went back to controller b but got thrown back to a - and the initial dealloc for the first part didn t kick in until late...

6242266
int	double
when i changed int to double i wouldn t use float for 99 of cases due to the rounding error you get is not worth the memory you save

6242336

os linux centos

6242447
int	double
finally note that your factorial implementation accepts an argument of type double but is only correct for int and your sin method should probably receive the angle as double

6242457
post	get
i tried to ask same question on this post but the result i get shows the menu in vertical

6242478
internationalization	translation
i m currently migrating a web application from a database-based internationalization approach each word having an entry in the translation table and the actual translation to one based on zend_translate and csv files

on some architecture addition might take twice as long as multiplication so now we have to go through the algorithm and calculate the number of additions we make and the number of multiplication we make in order to get an accurate runtime analysis

6242586
width	height
the approach that worked for me was to dynamically determine the dimensions of the content and set the height and width of the infobox correctly

6242586
width	height
insert content in infobox and set its height and width based on temp container dimensions

6242621
width	height
all you d have to do is determine the textview width and height and compute the number of characters that would fit

6242624
post	get
the problem is that if the page post something i could read that page but couldn t get page s profile at the same time so it wouldn t work well

6242637
int	chars
here the return type could be int or chars

6242656

so how to create relevant networkstream for each tcpclient for communication

6242862
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you can really only do it if you obtained a pointer to memory from malloc and then used realloc to change the size but i m quite sure that it s not even guaranteed that it will free the unused bytes

6242898
versioning	upgrade
the first thing i would suggest is to upgrade your versioning of ruby 1.9

6243036
getter	setter
and the prevalence of naive getter setter methods is simply due to php not providing an explicit construct for that

6243039
post	get
but i have a redirect from my post action to get action

6243047
folder	directory
so the problem is obviously that make is searching the source files in the root directory and if i copy native.c to my root folder everything works perfectly

6243064
getter	setter
bottom line is the menu works but it creates a javascript exception when trying to use specific style setter getter that will fail due to the framework not understanding the browser version

6243064
versioning	upgrade
in short the answer you may not want to hear upgrade your mootools to at least 1.2.5.1 or ideally 1.3.2 - you may need to use the compatibility mode versioning so your old plugins continue to work

6243066
getter	setter
it differs from case to case if you want to use private variables with public getter and setter or if you just want to declare a variable as public directly

6243066
getter	setter
the reason it might be good to use getter and setter is if you want to have control over when someone accessess the data

6243070
firefox	safari
but the text is not centered in the footer in firefox or in safari have yet to check it in ie

6243071
mousemove	mouseup

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
beginning august 1st weâ ll support the current and prior major release of google-chrome firefox internet explorer and safari on a rolling basis

6243281
webkit	gecko	height	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
this approach does however go a little bit over 100 because of the height of the border which you can correct for in ie8+ gecko webkit with the css box-sizing property use the value border-box

6243333
width	height
any controls you want to have resize like your buttons they should not have a width or a height defined in you xaml

6243337

6243638
folder	directory
so here is the image of the directory folder tree for my c libs folder

6243654
post	get
this should certainly work well enough so long as i continue to keep the number of comments in moderation low as any moderated comments for that particular post or page means all visitors will get the scripts included not just the commenter

6243669
width	height
the reason the cell is not filled 100 is very likely because the table by default has cell spacing set which restricts you from getting a 100 width height

6243704
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i dont think it browser related cause when its not working i have loaded these pages in windows ie 8 and google-chrome and on a mac safari firefox and google-chrome with the same results

floating-point	integer
use the hardware s floating-point machinery but augment it with your own integer exponents

6243927
floating-point	integer
put another way make bigfloat.significand be a floating-point number instead of an integer

6243935
ant	maven
i ve not used ant or maven much for java recently but i can tell you the main differences between them -- it basically boils down to automated conventions maven vs

6243935
ant	maven
where we use ant we use it because we had a project set up which we wanted to automate and maven wouldn t adapt to fit it

6243935
ant	maven
if you need to do something not supported by maven ant may be your only hope

6243935
ant	maven
personally i d use maven over ant if possible but i d admit that it s not always possible

edit2 the min max issue is related to how some rdbms including oracle handle aggregations on indexed columns

the reason this would fail is because nlist can take any number -- it can take int it can take double or for that matter any subclass of number

it has been a really long time since i wrote argotic it was written before system.servicemodel.syndication existed in .net but since the concept of author exists in both rss 2.0 and atom i don t really recall why the generic feed item did not include an authors collection

connecting to a server cannot be done through udp it requires a tcp server actually being there and listening for incoming connections on that particular port

6262928
packets	multicast
the fact that that port is used for sending out multicast packets doesn t suggest that there s anyone listening on it as well

6262928
filtering	grouping
if you want to read the data sent from a particular port - then you need to subscribe to all the grouping and analyze the udp packets and the ip frame if you have several servers transmitting to know the origin ip to see where they re coming from and filtering out the ones that come from the origin you fancy

6264506
button	checkbox
lets say i have an application which has three text-fields and i can type whatever i want into them lets also assume that i have a checkbox and a button

6264506
button	checkbox
and if the button is tapped while the checkbox is checked the nsstring values in these textfields should get saved somehow

6264525
qtextedit	qtextdocument
use qtextdocument instead of a qtextedit the latter is a widget which makes the output depend on resizing

6264545
google-chrome	firefox
i d like to setup a selenium server so that clients can record tests locally recorded tests can be replayed and tested on an ubuntu server with firefox + google-chrome

httpwebrequest can employ a webproxy that supports using networkcredentials so you don t have to mess around with headers

6264687
implements	extends
if the innereveniterator class does not extends any class or implements any interface i think it is nonsense because no other class can access any instance of it

6264687
implements	extends
however if it extends or implements any other non private class or interface it makes sense

6264756
public	protected
btw abstract classes often have public constructors when actually they are protected

i use the following statement sometimes to get the first 55 words of a post content

6265201

width	height
using imagemagick i d like to convert a batch of pngs to a fixed height of 1080px and a proportional width

group only by m.name apply max or min on s.emailaddress will give you a single address max with alphabetical ordering for strings

6265452
width	height
i have a vbox with fixed width and height and i add image objects with fixed width and height

6265479
carrierwave	paperclip
however if you haven t done much work with paperclip yet i would recommend you to swap to carrierwave

6265540
opera	safari
in this specific case apple does not allow this kind of interaction with safari or opera

6265624
clang	llvm
i downloaded llvm and clang and built

i want to show children element as a part of parent element when parent is hide

6265697
hide	show
in practical terms i need to show div when parent is hide

6265703
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception
if something shouldn t happen you probably want to know if it ever does happen - and the best way of making it obvious is often to throw a runtimeexception of some description illegalstateexception

6265801
inherited	properties
in any case you could start by adding a user properties to a controller from which all other controllers inherited

6265803
fadein	hide

6265813
outputstream	inputstream
the read write methods of the inputstream outputstream classes are not synchronized

6265813
outputstream	inputstream
it is possible however that if you re using a sub-class of inputstream outputstream that the reading writing methods you re calling are synchronized

6265831
config	ini
the following are ini and xml examples showing config of resources in that module

6265837
fieldset	formpanel
i would just use a single formpanel with multiple fieldset in if all the values need to be submitted in a single request

6265840
subtract	add
quick idea - go through the roman number from right to left if value of more to the left is smaller than then subtract it from the result if larger then add it

6265857
int	chars
assuming that the treatment of an int first argument is consistent all that will happen is that the const chars will be placed in a register when dosomethingwithfn calls abinaryfunction aunaryfunction will run as expected and the const chars may be overwritten during aunaryfunction but that s fine because nothing else will use it anyway

6265858
interpolation	splines
one of the problems you face is that a splines doesn t usually go through its control points as a kind of interpolation function

6265892
width	height
i have creating php application which takes images with any height and width

6265990
folder	directory
you should put the aicu32.dll and icudt40l.dat either into your application directory or into the system32 syswow64 folder on the client side

6265994
addition	multiplication
in the old days you had to write your own addition and multiplication subroutines for multi byte values

6265998
ant	maven
you can use ant s copy task via the antrun maven plugin

6266005
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
there s no upgrade for java in fact you always install a new versioning of java on your system and and free to decide whether do uninstall the previous one

6266011
width	height
i know how to figure out the height that works the size of the fontsize + 10px is usually good but i can t get the width

6266062
pop-up	dialog
dialog pop-up as soon as the page opens

6266062
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 4 google-chrome 11 and ie 9 i don t see the pop up

6266107
width	height
if you are already using the font height + 10 for height you can easily use the string width + x

6266148
versioning	upgrade
of course your other option would be a single app with an inapppurchase to upgrade to the full versioning

6266190
post	get
you would get the post and the post_type in one array

6266245
superclass	subclassing
however subclassing often define their own initializer or override an initializer of their superclass to add class-specific initializations

6266261
outputstream	inputstream	bufferedreader	urlconnection
i have been reading on url and urlconnection and i know that both buffered inputstream outputstream for character streams and bufferedreader writer for byte streams can be used to transfer the file from one ftp to another via url and urlconnection

6266278
textview	imageview
i m not sure about your implementation but another way to go about this is to add your bitmap to a framelayout as an imageview and then add a textview appropriately styled with an offset

6266285
maven	pom.xml
create a custom maven repository place your referenced jars in there and include them as dependencies in your pom.xml file

6266293

6266385
try-catch	exception-handling
the dosomethingwithanorganization method has a try-catch and can handle some exception-handling

6266424
int	chars
replace your chars with string numbers and convert to int before sorting like

6266468
int	chars
we can t move the size to the beginning such as 2int32tuple because int are not valid chars to begin a class name

6266476
post	get
it seems that your code trigger a get action after the post success

6266513
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation	nsoperation	nsblockoperation
i would suggest that if you need to have finer grained control over the operation s cancel state and interplay with the nsoperationqueue that you would be better off using an nsoperation rather than an nsblockoperation

6266530
serializable	deserialization
your snippet is right but serializable deserialization via bytearray cannot perform real deep copy copying of all references and containers

6266551
getter	setter
or you can create a global class which extends from the application class and write your own setter and getter methods to access data stored in this global class

6266557
primefaces	richfaces
if upgrading to jsf 2.x is indeed not an option then you ll have to look for a 3rd party jsf 1.x component library with builtin ajax functionality such as richfaces 3.x not 4.x since it requires jsf 2.x or primefaces 1.x not 2.x or newer since it requires jsf 2.x

6266591
client-side	server-side
also as a sidenote adobe flex allows you to create client-side pdfs using an open source library called alivepdf which i ve found to work well for basic pdf generation that bypasses server-side processing

6266638
ssl	https
there s also the possibilty to configure apache to host via https or ssl

6266638
ssl	https
using ssl https with apache

6266642

if you lose gps signal and the device falls back to cell tower triangulation it might put you way off the road somewhere and it s going to look like you strapped on a rocket pack to get way over there that fast

6266652
folder	directory
i have a drop down list on my page want the list items to be folder from a local directory on the web server.

6266671
google-chrome	firefox
and the result i see with google-chrome left and firefox right

6266696
sorting	filtering
as with most grids it gives me sorting paging filtering and ordering with just a few lines of code

6266719
width	height
you would always get the same value for example if you are asking a dummy string that s less than a line long how much height it would take for the supplied width

6266735
hide	show
the key is to use the rendered attribute to show hide the components so that only one or the other is actually updating the model at a time

6266751
post	get
this caused the get after the post

6266751
post	get
once i cleaned up the server side code i only get the post as expected

6266762
profiling	debugging
you should set your base sdk to the newest version you have installed and then set your deployment sdk to the minimum fw you are planning on supporting in your distribution test debugging profiling like this

6266864
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome opera and others seem to pride themselves by being up to date with the standards

6266874
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfectly fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie i tested 7 8 in ie the innerhtml of the new element domelm can t be set

6266888
translation	localization
i created a .net class library in c# with some resources for localization and already translation them to different languages and put them into different .resx-files

6266898
hide	show
in the past i would handle this scenario via an updatepanel and a wrapper panel around the fields that i want to show or hide

6266950
post	get
also personally when retrieving webpages especially when sending post or get variables i prefer to use curl

6266958
setinterval	settimeout
the setinterval and settimeout functions put the passed function into the callstack after the supplied duration has elapsed

6266982
hide	show
realistically you can t add controls once they ve been defined and passed off to word so it usually works best to predefine all the controls you re likely to need up front in your xml or the ribbon designer then hide show or disable enable the applicable controls as things happen in word

6267004
children	parent
instead of a massive loadstories method that knows everything about the entire data hierarchy you would load the xml document and pass it to a story initializer which will to initialize its scenes pass the document and the appropriate parent element to a scene initializer which will take care of building its children and on down the line

6267006
ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	freebsd	linux
ok works on ubuntu freebsd or mac yes linux

6267012
addition	multiplication
for example multiplication is of higher precedence than addition so 2 + 3 x 4 is equivalent to 2 + 3 x 4 not 2 + 3 x 4

6267019
google-chrome	safari
64 bit macos + 64 bit safari or 32 bit google-chrome

6267019
google-chrome	firefox
64 bit windows + 32 firefox or google-chrome

6267052
gridview	rowdatabound
you can bind the data for example in gridview s rowdatabound -handler

6267054

int	double
based on my tests casting a decimal or double to an int or long simply keeps the whole number portion of the number and discards the decimal portion

6268880
bluetooth	usb
interfacing with usb is more difficult than it sounds it would be harder to build something which would interface with that and measure millivolts than with bluetooth because the pic processor you use for analog to digital sampling and usb client would in fact have to either act as usb host or usb otg on a phone which is far more complicated than being a usb peripheral

6268911
int	double
you require the cast for decimal to int or double to int because the conversion results in a loss of precision therefore rather than allowing you to inadvertently perform a lossy operation you are expected to be explicit about it

6268911
int	double
going the other way around a double or decimal can fully represent any value assigned from an int and therefore the conversion can be done implicitly on your behalf

6268911
int	double
in terms of performance the cast of a double to int simply uses the conv.i4 opcode where using something like convert.toint32 double results in a function call to perform the conversion

6268913
int	double
note that math.round still returns decimal double but now properly rounded so you can cast it to int

later when you need to hide show an element use something like

6272506
superclass	subclassing
say we have superclass g and subclassing a and b

6272577
inherited	properties
i don t think i agree with your premise but the major benefit of prototype based inherited is that it allows runtime assignment of properties and methods on all members of the class even when there are already instances of that class

6272591
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome have a built-in extension updater an extension shouldn t bring its own

6272598
post	get
any http get requests in silverlight tend to cached so if you want to eliminate caching by the client browser use http post to make web service calls

6272598
post	get
hassideeffects simply states that it should use the post method to avoid the caching mechanism of the client get

6272598
post	get
the use of get by default for web service calls is for performance reasons because post responses are uncacheable by all major browsers per rfc 2616 which states that post should be an idempotent operation aka always results in an expected result which caching would break because the result may change over time

this method would not measure execution time for asynchronous functions executed via settimeout or setinterval but those shouldn t count against load time

google-chrome	safari
an alternative and likely simpler option is to use the javascript profiler built-in to google-chrome or safari s web inspector

6273142
cvs	rcs
older sccs cvs rcs could not distinguish between a tag identifier and a revision number

6273225

that s not aggregate initialization at all it s uniform initialization which basically in this case means calling the constructor and the no copy or move is probably done by return-value-optimization and nrvo

open your image in an image editor and make sure it s exactly the width and height you want it save it and for your div

6273489
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	width	height
also use your element inspector in google-chrome or safari or firefox to check if another bit of css is resizing the background or the height width of the div

6273496

6273537
getter	setter
defining getter setter makes more sense when you prefix the variable to get set

6273537
getter	setter
as you can see _thing is read-only and is accessed via the much nicer class.thing - it s also much more readable you can easily see which variables are related to which getter and setter

6273546
int	chars
you can use textview.getlayout .getlinestart int line and getlineend to find the chars offsets in the text

6273560

please refer to put or post the rest of the story

6273560
put	get
user send a get request to retrieve the specific url for file to be put to

6273560
put	get
then the user send put request to the url from the get response

6273605
post	put
the simple answer is you should use put instead of post in your case since you will be replacing the entire content of the file

6273605
post	put
take a look at put vs post

6273619
post	put
atompub and odata standards which are considered to be restful do agree on this though post creation while put updates

6273624
telerik	radwindow
telerik passes rwndrnd to the page that s being opened in the radwindow

6273630
peer	p2p
this error can be caused by making an attempt to make a p2p connection to the server s peer id

6273630
peer	p2p
i believe the problem is that you are attempting to make a p2p connection to the server s peer id

6273630
peer	p2p
in any case make sure you re not opening a p2p stream to the server s peer id

basically i have a web app running on a web server a database which has a user table with hash password and salt and of course the web client with javascript enabled

6273718
hash	salt
how does hash password_plain_text + salt vs

6273739
int	boolean
one option is to use two int representing the hour and the minute and a boolean representing am or pm

6273739
int	boolean
in this case we ve followed the convention that an int is used to store a boolean value

6273746
hash	salt
i don t think it would be a great idea to hash on the client side though as that would be revealing your salt to anyone who looks at your javascript

6273750
hash	salt
you can hash it on client but your hash password and salt might be compromised anyway so easy password can be bruted

6273797
hash	salt
hashing on the client side is not safe at all as it exposes not only your chosen hash method but also your salting mechanism and for a compromised client the actual salt value.

6273821
vb6	vba
we do have some vb6 and vba and .net code that also need to use our database files and for that we use the sqlite odbc driver just google it

6274097
fadein	fadeout
on i am attempting to make a slideshow of images on a page using the jquery fadein and fadeout effects

6274097
width	height
update the issue seems to be with fadeout on a element that does not have a width and height

6274097
width	height
when values are added to the width and height properties of div.carousel_item the fadeout call works properly

6274113
udp	tcp
i already have this working over public tcp but i prefer the privacy and simplicity of udp over azure connect.

6274154

6274200
express	node.js
i m finding i m writing a lot of code in node.js express along the following lines

if you allocate an object in viewwillappear or viewdidappear then release it in viewwilldisappear or viewdiddisppear

6274223
lwp	libwww-perl
libwww-perl is the name of the distribution and lwp is the name of the main module in that distribution

6274525
mouseover	mouseout
sidenote jquery gives this warning about mouseover also applies to mouseout

in android site performance tips - its given as avoid internal getter setter

6274591
getter	setter
my choice is to use direct field access but my friends are telling to use getter setter methods in android

6274688
width	height
for horizontal just do the same with top replaced with left y - x and height - width

6274692
fadein	fadeout
when i understand it right you want to fadeout the current and fadein the selected don t you

6274704
implements	extends
instead of extends thread use implements runnable

6274726
jobs	cron
in the linux world you would call these daemons or cron jobs

6274749
getter	setter
the choice between using getter and setter and allowing for direct field access is not typically one of performance but instead one of maintainability and encapsulation of data

6274749
getter	setter
typically you will use getter and setter to have tighter control over your data

6274765
width	height
each column or row correspond to iteration and height of same colors width for rows correspond to the variable value

6274772
decoder	encoder
this would require a small amount of static memory for both the encoder and decoder

6274799
getter	setter
to add to the answer from ed what the link you send refers to is to avoid internal getter setter

6274799
getter	setter
within the same class using the getter setter to access a field will cost you for nothing.

6274799
getter	setter
does not mean you should not use getter setter from other classes

6274834

6275079
serializable	deserialization
gson currently has a mechanism to register a type hierarchy adapter that reportedly can be configured for simple polymorphic deserialization but i don t see how that s the case as a type hierarchy adapter appears to just be a combined serializable deserializer instance creator leaving the details of instance creation up to the coder without providing any actual polymorphic type registration

6275127
getter	setter
if i understand correctly with the property function a getter setter and deleter can be defined

6275133

6275764
int	double
this is false typeof int .isassignablefrom typeof double

6275764
int	double
clearly a double is assignable from an int but the framework isassignablefrom gets it wrong

6275764
int	double
or is this a bug in .net caused by the special nature of int and double which have no inheritance relationship but are assignable in one direction

6275765
folder	directory
i want to loop through the directory in the assets folder then copy all of its contents

6275787
int	double
c# is providing the implicit conversion from int to double

6275787
int	double
so from the .net point of view double isn t assignable from int

6275787
int	double

6279470
int	boolean
by the way it should be clear that a for-loop is a construct in all the languages and not a function so it should never return a value like an int or a boolean or whatever else but only handle the flow of the code through the processor

put	get
here s where it starts to get tricky presumably because it takes a moment for the plugin to load and because the plugin only loads when the image is visible i ve put together the following jquery to hide the image at first fade it in imperceptibly to give the plugin a chance to load and then fade the image out again

6280007
google-chrome	firefox
alas whilst this little workaround serves its purpose very nicely in firefox and google-chrome ie 7 and 8 ignore the instructions to fade and simply drops the image in at full opacity before removing it a moment later

if you know the width and height of each tile you can calculate the vector2 position of each tile - it s deterministic based on an index so it doesn t need to be stored

6280282
division	modulo
knowing that each grid row is 3 tiles across and each column 3 tiles down we can use the modulo and division operators to get the row column for any tile index.

the attribute selected is not how you specify a selected radio button in firefox and google-chrome at least

6280653
gobject	dbus
your best bet here if you want to make this as asynchronous as possible and you re already using dbus may be to have a client process which uses cmd.cmdloop and sends signals to another process that uses the gobject mainloop to actually launch the remote processes

6280692
int	double
if you are currently using floating point intervals say a double of seconds since 1970 you may wish to consider int units say a long long of milliseconds since 1970

6280708
matlab	simulink
note that this uses simulink rather than matlab to interface to the radio - but since matlab and simulink can pass variables back and forth you should be able to achieve what you want

6280712
google-chrome	safari
this happens in google-chrome safari

6280719
button	checkbox
i ve made it so that when a button is clicked it creates a checkbox for each user

6280802
datalist	repeater
is repeater or datalist suitable for this

6280840
prng	random
for example you could call the same prng function as you re using now but store the value and extract 32 random bits out of it

6280841
uiview	subviews
you can achieve repositioning and resizing of your uitextview by configuring it as a subviews of a uiview instead

6280996
gridview	repeater
another gridview with the details of one practices this gridview will be in the repeater and therefor repeated for each and every practice

6281001
post	get
in addition to the other answers doing a custom hacked post get is always easily possible

6281036
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and safari all use javascript to native code compilers

6281043
maven	pom.xml
if the file doesn t exists in the test-classes directory you should configure resource management in the maven pom.xml

6281062
int	chars
the language is specifically designed not to care if chars points to something stored as int or chars

6281095
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so i have this javascript code block see below and it works in firefox google-chrome and safari

6281123
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it s not javascript and it s not my theme because the same thing happens if i disable js in my browser tested with google-chrome firefox ie and opera and use garland

6281124

i would like to achieve a minimum of code for max result

6281150
uilabel	uibutton
i am using standard uilabel and uibutton

6281178
post	put
i would recommend you look towards a rest architecture where it seems like a post or possibly a put request should be used

6281200
post	get
in php you access get variables from the _get associative array and post variables from _post

6281206
int	chars
on the embedded side i need to parse chars strings for floating point and int data

6281208
children	parent
what comes after home and before contact us you may need another column called order and that could be used to order the children of any given parent

6281244
put	get
im guessing its possible to get maven to put the source in a special jar using the maven-soure-plugin but this will usually be out of sync with the actual java files which the web project seems to be using directly

6281259
hash	md5
if so you could perhaps hash ala md5 sha the arrays and assume that if the two hash match then the two arrays match this would of course require benchmarking to ensure that it actually sped things up

6281478
min	max
seeing the min max dates will help you understand when the mismatches are occurring

6281501
dictionary	map
okay for step 1 and 2 reading from the dictionary when i m reading everything in i stored it in a map where the keys are the letter of the alphabet and the values are arraylists storing all the words beginning with that letter

6281520
highcharts	fusioncharts
i have looked at alternatives such as fusioncharts highcharts and few other jquery javascript flash powered charts

6281524
google-chrome	firefox
for example the following code works the same on both google-chrome and firefox

6281541
int	double
as the images should be displayed only in certain cells of the table and updated when a user clicks on a table cell an double int array is used which is of the same dimensions as the table

int	double
however if there are other cells which contain an image and should be updated the update is not shown although the double int array is updated

6281547
wordpress	joomla
for scripts such as joomla and wordpress you will need to follow their documentation for formatting the from fields properly

6281575
stateless	stateful
on subsequent request the same session id will be passed instead of passing username and password so is this stateful or stateless because i don t need any state information except the authentication of each request

6281582
int	chars
a chars and an int is interpreted differently

6281582
int	chars
for example 12 are two chars and also we can say that it is an int

6281582
int	chars
to input it as an int you should use d and as chars as there are two chars

6281582
int	chars
when you enter a chars when the format string is d it will detect that the input is not an int it is a chars and will stop at that moment and will return

6281592
folder	directory
i have experimented with a task that runs cmd.exe to del s q the working directory folder

6281616
folder	directory
it looks just like a regular os x app and the only difference i see in the directory structure is that my max msp made application has extra .framework folder as well as the objects i use which i guess are similar to functions in jscript

6281631
stateless	stateful
i could also see the argument especially in the java world where stateless and stateful beans are much more well defined

6281637
ostringstream	std
of course you forgot to create the std ostringstream anyway

6281637
std	ostream
the call to std ostream flush returns a non-const reference to

6281645
typedef	struct
you handle it just like the struct by giving it a name and using a pointer for the typedef

it looks like android does not currently support serving video from a ssl https link

6281876
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
currently five uiviewcontroller are switched via a uitabbarcontroller

6281904
postgresql	mysql
for mysql postgresql or sql server you can use information_schema.triggers

6281918
for-loop	arrays
i have added the for-loop to be safe in the cast of the last element in arrays

6281962
width	height
but my images are of different sizes in width the height is the same

6281972
chown	sudo
sudo chown username opt eclipse

6281975
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you view the source from firebug if you use firefox or inspector if you use safari or google-chrome you can see that the data is there

6282038
google-chrome	firefox
tested with firefox and google-chrome

6282040
implements	extends
if you just want a custom reusable toolbar that only changes some visual properties like the label of a the left button or let the right button visible or not etc.. maybe the best approach is to implements a base class that extends from uitoolbar and then use it in your view controllers

6282133
google-chrome	firefox
i ve done all this development in google-chrome but i receive the same errors in firefox 4 and ie8 also

6282191

if the jcarousel wrap is normal slider until end of div

6282399
getter	setter
one of the conveniences of the qt property system is that you can override setter and getter functions without the user having to know about them

6282400
deselect	multi-select
if you need multiple rows highlighted you will have to simulate multi-select by adding a dummy column and using that to control the background and of course you need to handle the selecting and deselect in the clicked event

6282409
width	height
if i resize based upon width the resulting resized image will be 120x92 i could just then fix the height but that will pixelate or squash the image i could also crop the end off with either imagegd or css overflow hidden

6282434
udp	tcp
this is for tcp but i expect you can do something similar for udp

6282438
hide	show
frame and then hide show them when needed

6282557
stdout	fflush
update neither fflush stdout nor setvbuf stdout null _ionbf 0 is working

6282606
stdout	fflush
you could try to fflush stdout after your printf

6282614
google-chrome	firefox
this works without any problem in firefox google-chrome etc but seems to get stuck in ie 8 and 9 7 seems to work until i refresh the page

6282693
width	height
any element that is not inserted into the dom will return 0 for height and width until it is inserted

6282720
folder	directory
i prefer to keep a separate directory in a public folder called modules duplicating my application modules structure that has nothing but assets css js images...

6282721
profiling	debugging
build for running is debugging build for profiling is release so both configuration have been tested

6282736
disk	ram
disk access is 2 orders of magnitude slower than access in ram

6282736
disk	ram
that means that without caching a hit against disk will be 200 times slower than accessing ram

6282812
post	get
note however that in most cases this should imply that we re going about something wrongly and i d consider a form for every element that s submitted in any form whether it s through standard get post ajax etc.

6282834
mouseover	mouseout
the alternative is to create it from scratch on every mouseover and then to delete it on mouseout which just feels wrong

i have a qscene object in qwidget and inside qwidget i have qgraphicsview

6282891
daemons	systemd
i have a centos 5.5 server running a local telnet daemons which is only accessible from localhost which prints out a list of active users on our accounting systemd when sent the correct commands through telnet

6282892
put	get	post	get	post	put
as i see it if i wish to translate this over to a restlet i will need to separate this out into 8-15 interfaces depending on which methods become get methods vs post or put - i don t think you can have more than one verb method get post put etc per interface

6282918
children	parent
everything after that is merging and you can only merge between immediate parent and children unless you jump through hoops to manually mess with merging.

6282958
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you can end up introducing data binding requirements inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged idataerrorinfo etc. into your service data objects

6283632
punctuation	words
in order to do so i ask if the next char is a punctuation mark but in this way the last words is left without an extra letter

6283676
width	height
as-is it maximizes the width and assumes that the height is not greater than the height of the screen

6283676
width	height
you may want to fit height instead of width also you could check the dimension calculation and ensure that it is not greater than the screen or screen - other_layout_elements

6283805
width	height
the issue seems to be with fadeout on a element that does not have a width and height

6283805
width	height
when values are added to the width and height properties of div.carousel_item the fadeout call works properly

6283859

6283942
next	except
i know that next week they have codegarden11 and they are supposed to talk a lot about umbraco 5 but i don t find a lot of documentations except this for this link

6283948

cstring	bstr
someone can use bstr wrapper like ccombstr or ms s cstring

6284526

i ve tried with a for-loop that pauses every .5 seconds using time.sleep and the window opens as soon as loops finishes

6284598
x86	64bit
64bit amd and later intel machines run faster than 32-bit x86 machines because when amd designed the new instruction set they added more cpu registers and made sse math the default

6284605
google-chrome	firefox
in my case-google google-chrome and firefox are downloading the image

6284606
x86	64bit
if you are running on a 64bit os try changing your projects settings to compile directly for x86 rather than anycpu

6284686
jar	war
on linux i can use file-roller and open an browse the content of an ear file without manually open it can even dig into contained war file and within that jar files quickly

6284767
for-loop	arrays
what would you do this will insert them into an arrays called li and the for-loop will cycle through

google-chrome	firefox
i ve looked at this before and found javascript that works for me with google-chrome firefox and ie when i test it but it seems randomly or browser specific it doesn t work

i want to extends the functionality of the base class not just implements it differently

6284948

put	get
the way to solve your problem is to put the get baskets owned route before the resources route

6295089
int	double
it is because you use pow function and then convert the result which is type double to int that causes precision loss

i like that the labels for the classes are kept with the classes themselves instead of having information about a subclassing stored with the superclass

6295651
superclass	subclassing
note that something needs to make sure those subclassing are loaded before vehicle_from_name is run presumably these three classes would be in different source files otherwise the superclass will have no way of knowing what subclassing exists you cannot depend on autoload to pull those classes in when running the constructor

6295706

multiplying all the bytes to get int multiplication

6295785

6296234
hide	show
after i have only to show and hide this windows and change the attached viewmodel

6296538
autocompletetextview	spinner
for example spinner and autocompletetextview both use popupwindow to display their associated lists of choices

you could always just write the regular output to stdout and your debug statements to stderr

6296597
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i have a uisegmentedcontrol which loads two different datasources for the uitableview

6296601
serializable	deserialization
in the case many things like json serializable and deserialization will be made automatically for you

6296626
children	parent
it seems like a hack to have to go to parent and then back to children

6296640
superclass	subclassing
but in almost every case you need to know this behavior of the superclass in order to properly subclassing it

6296680
children	parent
thats why when you go to the parent and ask for all children you get the right answer

6296708
super	self
super a self .__init__

6296719
portrait	landscape
so i think it if finding the coordinates that i m hitting in landscape but acting as if i was in portrait

6296828
pop-up	dialog
plop a big invisible button not hidden invisible over the entire page with a click action that pop-up a message dialog with whatever warning you wish

6296855

min	max
ib requires that the textviews be inside their own nsscrollviews even though their min max sizes are fixed so that they wonâ t actually scroll

6297037
solaris	bsd
the second fails because the shell builtin kill understands symbolic signals but the external command on solaris doesn t whereas on bsd and linux it does

6297067
stateless	stateful
yes there is the onunload event that you can use to trigger a quick ajax call but http is by definition a stateless protocol and attempting to create a solution which emulate a stateful connection will have flaws

jboss	glassfish
jboss 6 7 tomcat 7 glassfish 3 etc capability of invoking direct methods with arguments which you then apply on string#concat

6297297
equals	gethashcode
whenever you override equals you must override gethashcode so they are consistent

6297297
equals	gethashcode
but even with this implementation of gethashcode you ll still should fix the symmetry of your equals

6297312
hex	binary
the print is turning it in to hex because you re asking it to print the whole tuple and print sees your string as arbitrary binary data

6297328
hide	show
so one solution can be to hide the form before the application hide it so it won t get show while restoring

6297337
google-chrome	firefox
it means if user a is logged in on firefox and then from other computer or from other browser google-chrome comes request to log user a the first one should be logged out

6297415
atomic	interlocked
just one note lock-free approaches deal with atomic interlocked operations which means the data size needs to be small

6297421

my approach has been to create one and only one mechanism for reading a given source of data by defining 1 a model 2 a serializable deserialization layer and 3 a service layer

6297432
mp3	wav
i m trying to do some note recognition on mp3 or wav files

int	double
create a class that contains three vectors one for int one for double and one that has an entry for each item to tell the type of the corresponding item and its index in the corresponding vector

6297549
children	parent
i you don t need the parent with the child objects anymore after saving setting the children to null would be sufficient of course

6297549
children	parent
another and much better solution pull the original parent from the database again - without the children since you know that you only want to save changed parent properties

6297551
mouseup	mouseleave
when i select text and move mouse within jtextpane area all is fine but when mouseleave jtextpane area and i continue moving mouseup and down i have low performance

6297650
put	get
i d have liked to be able to get at it as it enumerates versus after it s put into an array like here but couldn t figure out how to get that deep into ar arel

6297654
put	get
i recommend you to get the number of columns and rows and put the data in 1 single flat array

6297666
ant	maven
it looks like it has both maven and ant builds so you can generate eclipse projects with both of these

6297666
maven	m2e
install m2e and import existing maven

6297694
uiwebview	nsurlprotocol
ideally you shouldn t have to reference the uiwebview directly from the nsurlprotocol

uiwebview	nsurlprotocol
however i have had need in the past to have an nsurlprotocol send messages to uiwebview that are outside of the regular delegate messages.

6297727

i can create a legislator object and fill it with what information i have but then i have to have some mechanism of tracking information availability with the getter and setter

6298054
ratingbar	textview
i have a listview where each listitem has a textview and ratingbar

6298062
wcf	openrasta	asp.net-mvc	openrasta

6298071
int	boolean
getchildview int int boolean view

6298077
accessor	properties
first we ll put the accessor for all the properties we care about

folder	directory
the problem with this is that in the gui where the user enters the application source directory it s not clear what part of the folder structure they have to enter and what is resolved by app.config

6298196

for-loop	arrays
the for-loop above is assigning the title of each calendar in my account to the string arrays calendarnames .

6298254
getter	setter
i will also need to create the getter and setter dynamically as well since i will be accessing the values

6298262
implements	extends
create your custom class my_config_database extends zend_config and implements any logic you want

6298323
getter	setter
it will allow you to add fields and methods such as the usual getter setter to a class definition

6298354
g++	gcc
note i think there was also a good reason to prefer g++ for c++ targets rather than using gcc

6298405
fflush	gets
if you have a problem exception it won t throw it at the point when the exception occurs but rather when the session gets fflush when it tries to write the sql to the db

6298415
getter	setter
with private objects + public getter setter you d only have to modify the code in the getter and setter assuming you want to keep the things being returned the same

6298446
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
the optimal solution would be if each task could have their own xml file which is loaded and added to the root preferencescreen as far as i know however this is not possible the only way to load it is into a preferenceactivity

6298475
copying	overwrite
the only thing i could think to check would be 1 accidentally writing to or overwriting the store somewhere else in code you intend to back the file up by copying it but instead overwrite it partially

6298496
mouse	keyboard
that should observe every observable mouse or keyboard event

6298523
post	get

6298537
profiling	debugging
this configuration works since i m able to debugging through dllhost but if i try and profiling the code or just attach the profiling to dllhost while i m debugging the profiling stops and i get the following output

6298553
width	height
if that is the only div on the page use a mobile stylesheet to strip out the positioning keeping only the width height and some smaller simpler margins

6298620
subtract	add
if you want the remainder to be always positive you need to subtract 1 from rg3 and add rg2 to r

6298679
equals	gethashcode
with the hashset my understanding is that adding elements to it takes care of the non-duplication by itself assuming you ve overrided the gethashcode and equals methods in someobject

6298684
ati	nvidia
on my intel hd graphics laptop everything works fine but on the nvidia geforce gl version 3.2 and the ati radeon gl version 2.1 at work my window with clear colour yellow shows but nothing renders

6298761
xmonad	xmobar
i also suggest that you spawn the xmobar instances in main rather than in loghook since the latter will spawn brand new copies of xmobar every time you do any xmonad action like changing focus

6298764
draggable	droppable
i m building a web-app that will allow users to drag and drop from a static set of 30 draggable elements onto a droppable canvas

6298764
draggable	droppable
i want to record the draggable elements positions inside the droppable div with x y offsets from the top left corner

6298764
draggable	droppable
my current strategy for doing this is to first use .offset to record the x y position of the droppable div and then subtract this from the .offset returned by the draggable element that was dropped to get the position from top left corner of the droppable

6298764
width	height
i will then convert my x y values into percentages of the width and height of the box

6298794
onclick	onmousedown
this also happens with the onclick and onmousedown events of controls in ie6 7 8

6298829
int	double
i cast to int because your types are int although they probably should be double or converted to your int lattice more intelligently

6298848
int	double
of course you ll have to convert the double to int using whatever rounding you prefer

6298861
width	height
the graphing program takes a number of arguments about the height width legends etc. and the data to be graphed

6298909
sorting	filtering
if you want that the data filtering paging and sorting will be done by client side the jqgrid itself you can consider to use loadonce true parameter of jqgrid

6298909
sorting	filtering
after the first data loading the jqgrid will change the datatype json to datatype local and later jqgrid will make sorting paging and filtering of the data locally

6298940
stderr	fflush
only rarely i will see it fflush the output from stderr to the console that i m using

6299002
width	height
you should then be able to set any options on the second main form when you show it such as its height width or screen position as desired

6299022
jtextfield	jlabel
if you have a bunch of jtextfields with associated jlabel i ve had success and fun working from an array of string that represents the jlabel texts and then placing the jtextfields into a so that i can easily get a reference to the jtextfield based on it s related string

6299037
jobs	cron
however if you are going to run thousands of jobs per day then you might run into the problem that the maximum frequency cron allows is once per minute

6299051
protovis	infovis
there are alternatives to graphviz protovis infovis

6299055
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in firefox google-chrome and ie8

6299143
sudo	passwd
well i found out that i can have capistrano send the sudo passwd first by running a sudo command

6299143
sudo	passwd
sudo remembers your passwd for a small time 5 minutes by default

6299143
sudo	passwd
and rvmsudo simply calls sudo with some environment variables set so it too remembers your passwd

6299197
min	max
get the highest set bit positions of the min and max for 4 it would be 3 and for 17 it would be 5

6299197
min	max
if that number is between min and max return

6299240
post	get
i ve worked around this by calling the redirect inside the post callback but that adds a few second delay because it doesn t get called until after the post completes

6299244
portrait	landscape
i m trying to make a spec on the ipad for an image gallery that has a 3x3 portrait layout but changes to a 3x2 layout on landscape

6299244
portrait	landscape
i m trying to get the landscape or portrait grid on application load and then change also on orientation change but every time i do change my orientation the thumbnails flicker and the grid is all out of wack

6299249
division	subtraction
easiest would be to convert the date time values into a unix timestamp and then simply do some subtraction division

6299275
move	drag
i think this would be your best option even though the user won t be able to physically click drag the components to move and resize them

6299339
installation	upgrade
because of this new installation and upgrade of existing installation often fail to authorize to wmq using the same channel that previously worked

6299380
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried the following code on google-chrome and firefox and i can t get the alert to pop up

6299461
for-loop	loops
there will be no real difference in performance between the foreach and the for loops - therefore the for-loop will be a better alternative for the situation you want to achieve

6299485
equals	gethashcode
as pointed out by guffa this will work best if the values are unique or the default equality comparer equalitycomparer function uses a unique value such as a custom gethashcode equals overload

6299542
ant	maven
iâ m working with maven 3 migrating the old application using hivemind and ant

6299549
udp	tcp
i have heard about a trick using udp instead of tcp

6299609
matplotlib	chaco
i am looking for a way to use empty circles as markers in chaco something like using markeredgecolor in matplotlib

6299631
google-chrome	firefox
so i ve got this bit of css working on firefox and google-chrome but it isn t working in ie9

6299654
post	get
apologies i cant seem to get the code to display properly in this post

6299700
google-chrome	firefox
what s confusing me however is that my current server setup is working in google-chrome but not in firefox

6299700
google-chrome	firefox
do google-chrome and firefox handle cross-domain restrictions differently

6299708
min	max
the way he has implemented the next min max method is as follows

6299722
width	height
use .getsize which returns an object with x and y properties for width and height

6299743
for-loop	loops
update ooh i discovered an incredibly short version with ugly imperative syntax by abusing for loops reverse-ordering the fact that assignments return a value consisting of only 25 characters though you will want var y which you can insert into a for-loop and +1 if you don t want 0...19

6299769
margin	text-align
playing about with text-align extra elements margin auto and so on

6299786
min	max
i got a great suggestion from someone about aabb point testing and it works great but i have gotten to the point where a max and a min point testing do not always work because often they won t be in the frustum but a plane from one of the sides will be

6299791
move	drag
i can drag from the unassigned list to either of the two tracks drag between the tracks or move an item back to the unassigned list

6299796
innodb	myisam
just change my database from myisam to innodb and all works fine

6299837
post	get
after looking after several existing post i am still not able to get my simpledateformat parser working

6299929
org.json	jackson
instead of using org.json s simplistic lib you could upgrade to a better json library such as jackson bind data as regular maps lists numbers etc and then most templating engines could access things as expected

6299929
getter	setter
or even use full data binding to pojos with setter getter if you need to access data from java code as well

6299941
comparator	comparable
you ll need to either implement comparable or use a comparator for the sorting to work though

6299958
ant	maven
for now you will just have to use the ant build.xml scripts for deploying or perhaps the liferay maven plugins which may support deployment

6299960
rspec	machinist
i want to test these models from rspec with all the niceties that some factories provide machinist factory-girl

6299974
multiplying	add
if all your functions have a similar format multiplying n numbers m times and add the results - or something similar then i think you can do this

6299994
getter	setter
normal empty methods or other short methods like most getter and setter are optimized by the jit by inlining them in the compiled code where a call to the method would normally appear the whole body of the method is placed instead

6299994
inline	inlining
there are many cases where inlining is not worth it from performance perspective and so the compiler doesn t inline them primarily when the method is longer than just few instructions

6299998
folder	directory
if the ajax link contact.html is activated from a page residing in a folder down from the root directory e.g homes homea homea.html the link breaks and the url in the address bar shows homes homea contact.html

6300012
kerberos	ntlm
i m also assuming that you have a farm environment with atleast one web front end and a separate db server to host the content db the web application is not enabled for anonymous access and the authentication scheme is integrated windows with ntlm not kerberos authorization and impersonation is enabled

6300042
rss	feed
i get the contents of rss feed but for my bad luck they have different structure

6300140
ssl	https
when i published the service to the staging environment which uses ssl to emulate the production environtment i had to update the web.config file of my service to work over https

6300145
google-chrome	firefox
one thing i have learned over the years is it is ok that your website doesn t look exactly the same in each browser in fact it can be a benefit because i have had situations where the intended design looked fairly different in ie but still still professional and some users who preferred that ui would visit with ie instead of the beloved firefox or google-chrome

6300151
bash	subshell
the pipe is forking another bash process so when you do the increment filcount is getting incremented in the subshell that s been forked after the pipe

6300172
bash	zsh
also if you want scoping to just work like you expected it to in spite of that pipeline you could use zsh instead of bash

6300188
960.gs	fluid
the site is built in wordpress using a variation of a fluid 960.gs

6300188
min	max
i d like the full div to scale between a max and min proportional size

6300227
post	put
edit when i post the data inside the database i simply use mysql real escape string and when i show the text where i click to search i put htmlentities on the text

6300231
for-loop	loops
another variation is using s as a variable in a for-loop and exit out of loops

6300251
serializable	deserialization
not compared to other deserialization serializable apis

6300274
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse are used to move around the 3d world and the buttons allow other manipulations

6300333
width	height
the .product-copy expands to content in height width is fixed

6300362
post	get
using print_r i get this i post only a part of it

6300378
hide	show
after that i would create further jquery to load after the dumbformstate plugin to then show hide the areas that are filled out

6300378
hide	show
its no problem if you call this before someone ever filled out their form because it will be blank and your logic should not show hide things that are blank anyway

6300388
min	max
i find i solve this with a group by and a max or min because for each distinct line there may be several docid values

6300394
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
this means that if your controller presents a modal controller and then it is dismissed the viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods will be called again

6300412
min	max
if you want only one or a concat or any operation then mysql cannot choose it arbitrarily for you you have to query it min max first group_concat ...

6300434
folder	directory
the solution is to get all the gems into the vendor folder and upload the whole thing to the dreamhost directory

6300452
background-color	transparency
ie6 7 are incorrectly ignoring the fallback so it s not really a fallback and have their transparency background-color because of a bug purely because the op has the colors both hex and rgba specified using background-color

6300452
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
is likely the best solution in the original case - a fallback colour is only necessary for older browser versions of opera especially firefox safari et al in the case of their gradients rgba not yet being supported

6300487
express	node.js
then again this sounds exactly like an appserver-ready problem so rails express for node.js or even chicagoboss if you re brave would be good platforms for this kind of application

6300495
width	height
the startwidth and startheight i think can be used as your max height and width

6300517
post	get
when you get all cleared out the original post gets through like magic

6300540
children	parent
this is because if an object has many parent that change it recalculates again for each one and also tells it s children to recalculate each time so they get several messages from just one parent

6300559
onresume	onpause
however you are notified when these things happen through your onpause callback and if the user returns to you onresume is called

6300565
google-chrome	safari
i have a universal search bar at the top of our site and it works beautifully in both google-chrome and safari

6300602
google-chrome	safari
i don t know if this will affect the good behavior in google-chrome or safari

6300610
portrait	landscape
iphone sdk orientation landscape and portrait views

6300661

6300696
pull	push
then pull to the usb drive from the off-net pc and push from the usb drive to the central repository

6300706
pascal	delphi
i ve got a basic word guessing game written in pascal for a console in delphi 7 where the guesses right or wrong are stored in a fixed array named guesses now what i need to do is test to see if they have guessed that letter already

6300706
for-loop	arrays
my problem is it follows the for-loop 20 times and should end as it is the first letter and is not in the guesses arrays but keeps repeating

6300708
peer	p2p
i have a feeling though that what you want to do is to have your peer communicate with each other rather than have a direct connection between them with no middleman server which is what is normally meant by p2p

6300780
vmware	virtualbox
1 use a virtual machine like virtualbox or vmware

6300787
bash	subshell
if you remove the pipeline into the while construct you remove bash s need to create a subshell

6300789
range	min
after that use a numbervalidator to validate the range setting the min value and maxvalue

6300793
hide	show
show and hide respectively the jquery mobile loading spinner

6300836
put	get
accessing the zend_auth singleton will work but if you want to get the exact values returned by your resource put something like this in your controller

6300837
rss	feed
if you want a single xpath expression that will work when applied to either an rss or an atom feed you could use either of the following xpath expressions

6300845
for-loop	loops
you can not use loops variable i outside for-loop

6300852
bash	zsh
when you type ls -l | mycode into the shell it is the shell program itself bash zsh that does all the trickery with pipes

6300908
g++	gcc
if you would use g++ as a driver instead of gcc you could instead use the -static-libstdc++ flag

6300955
filtering	grouping
the grouping by clause works with the aggregation operators in the select clause and could go anywhere after the from clause however it is better to think about aggregation on the filtering data so it comes after the where clause

6300967
post	get
i can get jsr-303 validation by setting up all the application context magic and by creating my post method as such and submitting with form-encoded values

6300982
inherited	subclassing
if you have the loadhtmlfile function in your parent class the subclassing will inherited it

6300994
addition	multiplication
in this case the caller finishes by performing an addition and a multiplication

6300994
addition	multiplication
we can take advantage of the distributive law of addition and the associative laws of multiplication and addition to transform the calculation into

6301050
httpconnection	downloading
i use httpconnection in java with the range property to downloading a segment of a file i set the range 60000-560000 and i can read 500000 bytes data which is 560000-60000

6301105
children	parent
it s adding the redcolor class correctly but the children inherit the color of their parent so they turn red as well

6301110
mouseleave	mouseenter
what if i wanted to automate another method like mouseenter or mouseleave

6301115
int	chars
chars is serialized as a number int by the xmlserializer

6301137
google-chrome	firefox
you might have some problems in your code because is not loading in firefox 4 either works fine en google-chrome

6301137
google-chrome	firefox
you forgot to open the so no more css after this line is considered in firefox and ie google-chrome is more cool on the error

6301150
put	get
i can t get beyond i m not sure how i m supposed to put the border inside the specific grid column or how to span it

6301152
for-loop	loops
for small loops would it be preferable to using a for-loop to avoid the creation of garbage

6301187
switching	screens
from the documentation switching to workspace i on screens sc

6301229
rspec	capybara
entirely in rspec and not using capybara the rspec documentation says that render_template is a wrapper on assert_template

firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
1 such as which version of which browser safari vs firefox vs google-chrome vs ie vs opera vs... or which server-side implementation v8 vs rhino vs...

6301324
pull	push
ideally you create a repo you can both read write on a shared server or drive and both push pull to it

6301326
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and firefox 4 on windows not on mac the web font was not loaded at the time that my script ran resulting in incorrect width measurements

6301326
google-chrome	firefox
the active event worked in google-chrome but in firefox 4 it was often fired before the font had been applied

6301346
hash	md5
json_encode the the new entry then md5 hash that json string

6301372
content-length	content-type
asihttprequest sets the content-length itself not sure about content-type

6301407
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
actually that should be true for both kde and gnome but i don t know about xfce slim or xkcd

6301425
put	get
i don t know any way to get ib to allow you to put this into your window but it ll be in your nib

6301428
profiling	instrumentation	profiling	debugging
i ve been debugging this for quite some time using instrumentation profiling etc and had no luck

6301464
children	parent
verify that your button that submits the form has .also make sure that the parent of the validators is not set to or the children will not render on the page

6301470
oncreate	onstart
the book says the system calls oncreate when the service is first created but before calling onstart

6301526
try-catch	exception-handling
if you wrap your do it code in this method with a try-catch exception-handling and you can log it there as still throw it

6301583
folder	directory
the aapt tool retains the directory structure specified in the add command if you want to add something to an existing folder in an apk you simply must have a similar folder on your system and must specify each file to add fully listing the directory

6301583
folder	directory
the pic1.png that will is added resides in a folder in the current working directory of the terminal res drawable-hdpi hope this answered your question

6301592
pop-up	dialog
after clicking on that click on the security tab on the dialog that pop-up

6301636
int	double
for reasons that i don t understand on silverlight the value as seen by the converter is of type double but it should be int

6301676
tiff	png
we can thus export this image as a jpeg png or tiff

6301689
postgresql	mysql
i want to build an asp.net site using mono and a non sql server database like postgresql or mysql

6301689
postgresql	mysql
asp.net uses guids in their membership providers for userids and so forth and postgresql mysql don t deal so well with guids

6301706
keydown	keyup
i need to be able to get the keyup and keydown

6301709

like for example i have this table with checkbox and when a checkbox was checked and a certain button was clicked the button will perform its assigned task

6301731
punctuation	words
which contains javascript which can be used to break english text into an array of words and punctuation where words can be hyphenated well-defined or compound won t

6301734
int	double
-- this is dangerous the 3rd argument sdpacesused should be int not double

6301735
postgresql	mysql
it should be easily adaptable to open source db s such as mysql and postgresql with its simple approach

6301742
submit	submission
if you are looking at a server side solution you can have two submit buttons in the form with different name attributes and then check the or variables depending on your form submission method

6301754
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the above works fine with google-chrome and safari but doesn t with firefox

6301754
google-chrome	firefox
it just doesn t trigger the event handler in firefox as it does in google-chrome

6301785
gif	png
one non-js way to make it harder for people is to absolutely position and size a clear png gif on top of anything you want to make hard to download with a right click

6301789
prepare	execute
normally if you just use a prepare statement in place of a plain query it s marginally slower since the query is prepare and execute in two steps instead of one

6301789
prepare	execute
regarding your last question there s no reason you can t use the same query with a prepare statement as you would through the normal query parser no reason to execute one version with an in and the other with a bunch of ors

6301790
domxpath	domdocument
you can use domdocument and domxpath to extract urls and filename safely

6301815
folder	directory
that will take you directly to the permissions section of the folder properties for the web site directory

6301859
width	height
i think as long as you also save the height width of the box then it can be reconstructed as you have all the required data to do so

6301862
nsurl	nsstring
off the top of my head it looks like thefirstnoise is actually an nspathstore2 a private subclass of nsstring instead of an nsurl

6301903
postgresql	mysql
it will be better to use server process based database mysql postgresql etc. to implement desired app behaviour

6301920
int	boolean
using this you can treat any int much like a size 32 boolean array and set or unset bits at any position

6302022
inherited	properties
this will show all enumerable properties including ones inherited delegated

6302022
inherited	properties
to disregard inherited properties add this to the body of the loop.

6302127
google-chrome	firefox
similar problem occur google-chrome 5.0.396.0 but other google-chrome versions and ie firefox are working well

6302154

firefox	safari
all appears fine in firefox but in safari my content is jumping up to where my nav is as if my nav does not exist

6302233
put	get
assuming that you want to complete the sentence input by the user then you could put all of your strings into a sortedset and use the tailset method to get a list of strings that are greater than the input string since the string comparator considers a longer string a that starts with string b to be greater than b

6302237
hash	md5
i can generate a pseudo-random number based on the password by taking the integer value of a hash like md5 but i m not sure how i can use this to then

6302254
put	get
you already have a factory method to get the api client - just put call to pooling layer within method

6302291
multiplying	add
math is math - it doesn t matter is you add or multiplying in base 2 in base 10 or in base 16 the answer is always the same

6302345
super	extends
one way which is my favorite is use one as a super class so class poll extends blog

6302389
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller with three tabs each is a uiviewcontroller with a uitableview

6302389
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
this is why i want to clear this out when a user logs out across the three uiviewcontroller in the uitabbarcontroller

6302402
put	get
here s the important insight as long as every object get put or posted to the system has a unique id the second layer can be completely independent of the first

6302404
disk	ram
the library won t be loaded from disk to ram each time

6302405
post	put
you can do http post as put and delete btw using wininet

6302406
rvm	bundler
i use rvm and bundler when working with rails

6302406
rspec	capybara
this made sense because almost all of these selenium tests are testing the old half of the hybrid system and will be replaced with rspec cucumber capybara tests for the new rails code as it is integrated until the old half along with the stand alone tests are no more

6302458
put	get
to clean it up and to put stuff in functions that get called from index.php

it works in all recent version of safari and firefox and ie 9 and newer â and if you re open to javascript solutions transformie adds support for 6+

6302540
vbulletin	phpbb	vbulletin	ipb	ipb	phpbb
well as impex does not support it you may install another forum software phpbb smf ipb import your data to this installation using their tools which likely support importing from vb4 and after that import content from this installation to your new vbulletin 4 installation using impex

6302540
hash	salt
this however might be considered as a plus because your db was compromised password hash and salt could have leaked and knowing this it isn t very hard to bruteforce someone s password on modern hardware

6302541
createelement	domdocument
using domdocument createelement before loadhtmlfile creates 2 domdocuments

6302569
client-side	server-side
the important point is that the decision of whether or not to handle the form has to be made on the server-side not the client-side

6302577
ubuntu	linux
one more doubt is that i checked the schedule function of both my pc os ubuntu and my phone which also runs linux kernel

6302595
hide	show
i want a tag or a label might be correct actually to appear behind an input field so that i can show the active caret on the input field and then hide the absolutely positioned tag when the user starts to typing

width 500 height 2000px but the colorbox keeps on setting its height not larger than the browser screen height

6302655
post	get
i am using graph api to get the feed post

6302674
onfocus	onblur
otherwise you can take a look at the onblur and onfocus events for

6302693
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the apparent cause of this is the server sending an x-frame-options heading and the response of firefox and internet explorer is to display an error message about security and frames while the response of webkit browsers such as google-chrome and safari is to render an unhelpful blank frame

6302714
awk	ksh
you can pretty much do anything with python that you can do with ksh only easier shells have a lot of stuff built in but many scripts will reach out to helpers like grep sed awk and so forth to do grunt work

6302798
postgresql	mysql
both mysql and postgresql have well maintained .net providers

6302831
children	parent
but a common point when dealing with y-to-x-relationships is that the parent here stock cant be persisted before its children here stocksize

6302862

then create another asset using avmutablecomposition a subclass of avasset

6311618
put	get
you can put those ordered queries into subqueries to get around not being able to union them directly

6311629
min	max
u can use max min to get value u need

6311675
mp4	h.264
i m encoding as format mp4 file video codec h.264

6311687
gif	png
in the middle it represents file name - so this will match only if file name ends with jpg jpeg png gif

6311707
keydown	keyup
whenever i have a f9 keyup event after a ctrl keydown and before a ctrl keyup ctrl is still pressed i call my method

6311717
put	get
failing that i would be willing to get the entire remote site once and then manually put individual files that i change locally back provided it s not a cumbersome process

6311719
put	get
problem i m having is that the select part of this seems to be getting completely ignored by rails so the count field doesn t get put into the query and i end up with the error unknown column post_count in having clause

6311737
maven	m2e
i d like to specify the main class in a jar file that i am packaging using m2e right-click - run as - maven package

6311737
maven	pom.xml
i m still learning maven and from what i ve read the straight-up way of accomplishing this task is to add a stanza to the pom.xml

6311737
m2e	pom.xml
and if so do i do this through m2e or should i just copy all the extra effective pom.xml stuff and paste it into the actual pom.xml using a text editor

6311737
m2e	pom.xml
when i viewed effective pom.xml in m2e it displayed everything that i put in i assume

6311737
m2e	pom.xml
i checked the m2e tabs and nothing seemed to have been updated as a result of my manual edits of pom.xml other than the effective pom.xml tab

6311743
awt	swing
this is the opposite approach to rendering the swing components in postrender -- jcanvas3d renders into an offscreen buffer and then paints to the screen with awt creating a lightweight canvas that interacts properly with components in the jlayeredpane even if they are transparent

6311772
width	height
the container s preferred height is a function of the width and is either

6311772
width	height
the minimum height needed to get the components to fit within the width when laid out in more than one column

6311772
width	height
edit this is very close to this other question about vertical layout but that layout has the component height being the constraint and mine has the component width being a constraint

6311792
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome and i m using windows 7

6311808
prng	random
here since it looks like you re just doing random sampling all you have to do to get the different processors to generate different random numbers to give to fishers.twotailed is to ensure they all have different seeds to the prng

6311887
int	double
aside from the double vs int happening in that action you re thinking of double as a precise unit

6311940
put	get
when i put an alertdialog in a different class and instantiate it i can only get the dialog to show if i use myclass.this from the parent class

6311944
google-chrome	firefox
when developing it s good practice to test on at least ie firefox and google-chrome as they re the most popular browsers at the moment

6311961
memcached	apc
don t write your own cache because anything you write in php will be slower than can be supported by native extensions like apc or memcached or even mysql itself

6311961
memcached	apc
if you want an even faster cache access use an in-memory cache like apc or memcached

6311965
hide	show
php settings can hide these messages but we are going to show them for debug purposes

6311969
google-chrome	firefox
so far my code works in firefox and google-chrome but not ie

6312027
stdout	stderr
i have a program that outputs to stdout and stderr but doesn t make use of them in the correct way

6312027
stdout	stderr
some errors go to stdout some go do stderr non error stuff goes to stderr and it prints way to much info on stdout

6312027
stdout	stderr
save all output of from both stderr and stdout to a file don t print it to screen

6312027
stdout	stderr
filter out all warning and error messages on stderr and stdout from warning|error to empty line and colorize only error words redirect output to stderr

6312032
ubuntu	debian
while we enable that for debian ubuntu i do not know what the default for windows is

6312071
button	checkbox
you should use checkbox to make this happen or change the to || to check that at leased one of the button is checked

6312073
hide	show
i want to click on a button and execute a jquery click event to hide show a div that will be show as modal on top of flash file

even though this bug is fixed if you have a versioning of mysql prior to 2005-09-26 upgrade immediately or at least don t use replace

6312193
tabitem	contentcontrol
contentcontrol contentcontrol tabitem .content .contenttemplate null

6312210
getter	setter
that s because the getter and setter of document.cookie do differ

6312231

however the photos that were taken in the portrait mode are rotated 90 degrees to the left while the landscape photos are properly uploaded

6312234
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you are targeting ie firefox 3.5+ safari or google-chrome the ondrop event should work

if you can do a request via get instead of post

6312260
profiling	debugging
i like xdebug for remote debugging and profiling

6312298
g++	gcc
for standard search directories see an introduction to gcc - for the gnu compilers gcc and g++ - setting search paths

6312312
stdout	stderr
when i added that in bash i could prove to my satisfaction that stderr was being redirected to stdout

6312359
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works for all the latest versions of ie also ie7 and 8 firefox safari google-chrome and opera

6312435
post	get
if you are doing a post and want to show the user a detail page after the post use the post redirect get pattern

6312480
mouse	keyboard
i would like to be able to assign a key on my keyboard to be equivalent to a left mouse click

6312508
post	get
miles sabin describes a very nice way to get union type in his recent blog post unboxed union types in scala via the curry-howard isomorphism

6312518
google-chrome	safari
when i change the window.location.hash in google-chrome and safari the page doesn t reload - this is the behavior i want

6312587
inherited	properties
your code is getting all the properties defined for a paragraph html element including inherited properties

6312596
springsource	grails
i am using the current version of springsource tool suite with the groovy grails plugin installed

6312735
gif	png
for screenshots you should rather be using gif or better png

6312740
folder	directory
now look in explorer at this directory you will see a folder per database

6312814
hash	hmac
so when the page is being generated take all of your existing protected variables combine them somehow with a server-side secret value and hash correction hmac them

6312820
box-sizing	border-box
you can use box-sizing border-box

6312820
box-sizing	border-box
although just setting padding 0 and forgetting about box-sizing border-box seems to work for me

6312821
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so i do have the height but i m not sure where to call contentsizeforviewinpopover i did try to call it in viewdidappear and viewwillappear but with no success since it seems that the table gets populated later and the actual height is only available later

6312827
mouse	keyboard
not exactly what you want but in the system preferences - universal access you can turn on mouse keys - and with them you can move and click mouse by keyboard

6312873
width	height
the -1 1 range in clip-space maps to 0 width height in window space

6312929

- look for castle-windsor spring.net unity structuremap autofac ninject ...

6312991
google-chrome	firefox
there is some code for nss google-chrome and firefox nothing merged yet but it works

6313006
inherited	properties
in other words the vertical-align properties the margin-top properties the padding-top properties and the float properties are set to default values and don t inherited a value that might cause this presentation

6313020
put	get
basically get a particular method from the legacy application rename it modify the content of the method to fit the new format and put that method in a class for the new project

6313047
firefox	safari
i need the page to be defined that way so safari and firefox 3.6 will correctly render the svg images i have on there so removing it isn t an option unless there s some other way to make safari and firefox 3.6 render svg images

6313063
ienumerable	iqueryable
the terminology on the page you reference may be a bit off - since both entityset and iqueryable derive from ienumerable if entityset implemented iqueryable directly then implementing ienumerable would be redundant

6313087
submit	submission
one way of getting around this would be to put the submit on a slight delay and then check for a cancel flag before actually submission

6313090
firefox	safari
when i load website in firefox 4 i don t know older versions perhaps and safari the website is slow

6313090
firefox	safari
after deconstructing and building back this website i realized that the css for safari and firefox is the cause of the slow down

6313090
firefox	safari
ok this is what is causing the slow down in both safari and firefox

6313096
hash	md5
see this page for info on an md5 hash

6313096
hash	md5
this means you need 16 hex chars or half the md5 hash to generate 64 bits

6313117
accelerometer	gyroscope
i can t use the simulator because the application is very opengl-heavy and uses an accelerometer gyroscope

6313164
stdout	stderr
there are three standard file-handles stdin stdout and stderr

6313164
stdout	stderr
you can write to stderr even when stdout is being redirected to a file

6313174
portrait	landscape
i have different views controller with xib files all is working well when navigate between this views on portrait mode when the actual view is switching to landscape the view resize perfectly

6313174
portrait	landscape
but when the device stay on landscape and navigate to others views xib the new view open show like in portrait mode and didn t resize and the view go out of the screen and on the right part i can see a part of the last view

6313197
opera	google-chrome
the animations are slower than google-chrome and opera

6313208
post	get
running it on every post get and cookie item eats up execution time

6313227
post	get
the problem is that i want to be able to link back to the original items in my client s sharepoint site and the urls that i get for blog post and announcement list items using the splistitem.url property don t work

6313227
post	get
for example if my blog post is listitemid #12 the url that i get from splistitem.url is something like

6313264
openbsd	linux
for such systems namely openbsd but there are modified linux versions which do it too your mmap above will fail

6313319
ssl	https
first since you re using ssl https you don t really need to encode the credentials seems a bit overkill

6313356
ubuntu	linux
currently i am running ubuntu 10.10 using the linux kernel 2.6.35-28-generic

6313358
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it reproduces in safari 5.0.5 google-chrome 12.0.742.91 while firefox 4.0.1 resizes a box in both ways

for p from 0 to 2n-1 and q from max 0 p-n+1 to min p n-1

6313419
floating-point	integer
each floating-point number in the ieee 754 standard is in effect some integer multiplied by some integer power of two

6313428
addclass	removeclass
for example if in chrome i do console.log i see the class changes i m using removeclass addclass in jquery

6313438
ilist	icollection
do not implement ilist ilist icollection or

6313438
ienumerable	iqueryable
using the asqueryable extension method returns an object which only implements iqueryable and ienumerable and therefore will show the results view option

6313457
int	chars
the return value from fgetc should also be an int since it has to represent every possible chars plus eof

6313470
int	chars
please note that fgetc requires an int well something larger than a chars -- int is customary for its return value eof is a possible return value in addition to any of the values that chars might take

6313496
folder	directory
however i sometimes use the xlstart folder in excel s installation directory

6313554
hide	show
you might like to try hide instead which will not null the window but just not show it on the screen

6313565
postgresql	mysql
i don t need an easy way to manage it i just want a setup i can install that will already have apache php mysql or postgresql doesn t matter and preferably eclipse already installed so i can just load it up into virtualbox and log in to some form of linux and start to get thing set up

6313569
xna	spritebatch
edit also overriding the spritebatch vertex shader is very difficult xna before 4.0

6313582
vmware	virtualbox
bitnami has a number of preconfigured vm images available for download that can be used in virtualbox or vmware for free

6313592
mvp	presenter
when using the mvp pattern as described here in gwt how do you create a presenter associated with a view when the view is part of another uibinder-defined view

6313685
namenode	hdfs
same program ran on a single machine namenode datanode exist on the same machine but there is only one file in the hdfs input directory

6313693
division	modulo
modulo returns the remainder when performing integer division

6313693
multiplying	add
now add minutes - to determine minutes as seconds you multiplying them times 60

6313693
integer	fractions
now we see how mod works - because if you divide 630 by 60 you get 10.5 but if you ignore the fractions whole integer division you get 10

6313721
inherited	subclassing
i guess i can still rely on normal inherited as long as it s the subclassing version that s proprietary and not the original but for most features currently there is only one group that doesn t have the priveledges and it s not always the same group for each feature and the other groups do

6313721
filtering	grouping
so if i was to use inheritance i d probably need a bunch of directories files like secretfroma secretfromb ... secretfromz and then for each of the other grouping i d need from secretfromz import for every module whereas with the replacement technique i described i can just add stubs for functionality i want to filtering

6313723
width	margin
by setting the width to 100 and a margin of 10px the textarea will be a 100 width of it s container shifted down and to the left 10px

6313750
move	drag
in other words if i pan the scene with scroll bars or pick up the image and drag move it around in the scene i want all the tiles to also move and stay in the right position relative to each other

6313754
children	parent
add in extra conditions where needed apparently conditions don t inherit from parent entities so you have to manually add them to the children and compile

6313795
inherited	subclassing
my thinking was to create my own uiviewcontroller subclassing say authenticatedviewcontroller and make my other controllers inherited it

6313813
min	max
however i am trying to get the corresponding time of the max temp and min temp

6313846
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to use a for-loop to examine each character in an arrays and print the character it s position in the arrays and what type of character it is vowel consonant etc.

6313847
mouseleave	mouseenter
i want to animate a div by first making it s border thicker by 5px on mouseenter then decreasing the border by 5px on mouseleave the tricky part is that i don t want the div to look like it s moving if you just animate the borders the whole div will look like it shifts not just the border getting thicker thinner

6313847
mouseleave	mouseenter
the div animates just fine on mouseenter i can make the border thicker without the div actually moving out of place but when the mouseleave is triggered the div will first relocate itself to the position as if the margin -5px was never called and then decrease it s border slowly and it seems like the magin 0px isn t actually being called

6313864
codeigniter	kohana
ok so hmvc in codeigniter is the way to go for scalable web applications with kohana 3 based off many stackoverflow discussions such as hmvc patterns and mvc vs hmvc

6313878
tabitem	contentcontrol
why contentcontrol contentcontrol tabitem .content .contenttemplate is null

6313878
tabitem	contentcontrol
also casting tabitem to contentcontrol to get at the same content property just makes it harder to read

6313891
post	put
if someone writes a post in english we just put it in post model and we put translated post in postespanish model

6313891
post	put
and if someone writes a post in spanish we first create a post instance then create a postespanish instance and put content in postespanish and if someone translate this spanish post we put translated post in its referring post

6313893
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql etc

6313898
ftp	telnet
debugging in the win ce device is very time consuming as it involves copying the files through ftp registering the com in the device using telnet and debug the dll through remote debugging

6313899
int	chars
this will validate the problem if i give it a chars or a word instead of an int and will ask for an int again this works actually prety as planed but if i give this a negative number i should give 2 enter before it to show the message and ask for the number again this wont hapenn if i give it a chars string or an int between ranges or out ranges but beeing positive

6313912
width	height
once your wrapper is set you can specify height and width to 100 for your iframe

6313918
tinyint	boolean
as for remembering whether a box has been checked you most likely want boolean a synonym for tinyint 1

6313952
versioning	upgrade
normally you would use this for tracking your own schema versioning - eg first versioning of app is 1 and when you change schema three app versioning later you set it to 2 to detect the schema upgrade has been done by your code

6313990
innodb	myisam
you can download the slides for migrating from myisam to innodb here

6314012
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox and google-chrome nothing appears

6314012
google-chrome	safari
i haven t tried safari as i uninstalled it a while ago but in my experience its rendering works alot like google-chrome anyway

6314056
fontfamily	font-size
similar question changing body font-size based on fontfamily with jquery

6314079
ubuntu	linux
to test its reliability i wrote a test program linux ubuntu 4.4.1 g++ -04 -wall and i was shocked to see the behavior

6314088
post	get
i just want to get the claims i m interested in from the post and deal with setting auth stuff up myself from there

6314100
hide	show
#token2 .toggle will toggle the visibility show and hide do the specific operations

6314122
postgresql	mysql
when you have circular foreign keys you need what postgresql calls deferred constraints don t know if mysql has these

6314130
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie firefox and google-chrome

6314214
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	memmove	strncpy	strcpy	memmove	strcpy	strncpy
normally i use strcpy strncpy functions to copy strings and memcpy memmove to copy binary data

6314216
kermit	xmodem	kermit	zmodem	xmodem	zmodem
back in the old days of serial ports and pots modems we used protocols like xmodem ymodem zmodem and kermit to transfer files over the serial connection

6314227
width	height
i don t believe your width x and height y syntax is correct and your #a float property is missing a colon

6314230
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	memmove	strncpy	strcpy	memmove	strcpy	strncpy
string manipulation functions like strcpy and strncpy will stop when they see these characters whereas byte manipulation functions like memcpy and memmove will always continue for the number of bytes you tell them to

6314232
hex	binary
to better view what the contents of a binary file look like you would need a hex editor like hiew editor for windows or hexedit for linux

6314275
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you can put your view building code into a separate routine not a nib or loadview or viewdidload or even viewdidappear and then release all the subviews of self.view and call the view builder again

6314287
ord	chr
as well if you want to turn a letter into a number and you don t really care what number you could use the ord chr functions and not even need a dictionary

6314346
cydia	tweak
if you are jailbroken theres a tweak on cydia

6314369
apache	nginx
did you consider cgi fcgi module option with nginx apache etc

6314410
implements	extends
these generic parameters can be constrained generic arguments shall extends some class and or implements certain interfaces or unconstrained

6314411
pop-up	dialog
i would like to modify the spinner pop-up dialog

6314414
children	parent
i m having trouble adding children to a given parent

6314451
omnixml	nativexml
all open source object serialization libraries which i know of jvappstorage nativexml omnixml superobject lkjson seem to have no support for generics properties yet

6314510
post	get
but assuming you re going forward with get instead of rewriting to use post i ll give some advice

6314523
writetofile	nsdata	nsdata	nserror
use nsdata - writetofile options error instead and see what does the returned error nserror say

6314555
int	boolean
- add adds an object to a list - an object consists of a name string value int and a boolean flag

6314568
hide	show
as stated by somebody jquery is required for the javascript version to work but you could easily remove it it s only used for the document.ready and show hide

6314568
hide	show
and for the show and hide stuff you could use something like and for more reliable cross browser techniques see here

6314604
inherited	properties
in addition you can have create a new class so that the div for for banner can inherited the properties this way you can seperate the div for the image and text

6314643
hide	fadeout
i want the fadeout effect or want to hide the row with slow speed

6314656
protovis	infovis
with your third requirement in mind take a look at something like this protovis interactive graph visualization or this infovis graph example code

6314731
x86	64bit
each type of cpu has its own set of opcodes and even if the intel x86 architecture has many similarities among 16 32 and 64bit opcodes there are enough differences and the abi is anyway different

6314809
jquery	scriptaculous
jquery and scriptaculous are good choices

6314843
post	get
if you want to solve that bit step through the logged in step and make sure that you have a user_session by the time you hit the post get calls

6314863
inherited	subclassing
the difference between inherited via a subclassing and access to members via inner classes is that inherited of members allows for members to shadowed for attributes and overridden for methods

6314872
put	get
then i get the dll and put it in bin folder of the website

6314938
src	attr
image attr src data1

6314955
put	get
simply put you cannot get rid of those buttons for mobile web

6314981
innodb	myisam
not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma

6314985
min	max
there is good reason for these low-level functions not caching min max results

6314985
min	max
if you want to quickly get min max element of a container that is modified often you can

6314985
min	max
1 cahe maintain min max values yourself

6314988
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i m trying to make a loops that will recurse through an arrays of bytes and compare them to the next one in the arrays presumably using a for-loop to iterate through each entry

6314992
integer	unsigned
display register and memory values in different representations signed integer unsigned integer hexadecimal and ascii

6315012
implements	extends
if you want the listview with custom properties try to implements your own customadapter which extends the baseadapter

6315049
maven	m2e
if you import the project into eclipse as an existing maven project using m2e then you can do a run as maven build and run mvn liferay deploy

6315053
ssl	https
if you mean sending from browser to your server then you need to use https ssl to encrypt the connection not the password itself

6315053
hash	salt
you should hash it with a strong salt per user is best and a slow algorithm

6315059
google-chrome	firefox
it works for me in google-chrome 12.0 and firefox 3.5

6315065
hide	show
when i roll over .comptext_rollover div it should hide the initial div on the page and show the minipage div

6315095
opera	google-chrome
i am sending back access-control-allow-origin header but the browser nor google-chrome or opera won t let me connect

6315149
folder	directory
from what i can see you re getting a directory looking at all the files in there and if one of them is a directory you look at all the files etc recursively which could end up being very heavy depending on the start folder

6315161
jar	war
to traverse an internal jar file say jar within a war or war within an ear use the read method to read the current entry into a new jarinputstream object

6315228
onresume	onpause	oncreate	ondestroy
if you want your activity to be notified via observer pattern you can use subscribe in your onresume oncreate and unsubscribe in your onpause or ondestroy

6315228
onresume	onpause
my choice would be to use onresume and onpause this way your activity won t be notified if it s not visible

6315229
google-chrome	safari
i used to edit the safari google-chrome scroll bars using webkit and there are many examples about that

6315334
restrict	shared
personally i am considering trying out zend lucene on a small project - probably no more than 1 000 documents in the index because i am restrict to shared hosting as far as i understand sphinx requires an external daemon

6315358
post	get
if i change the post max value back top 8m i get message like this

6315468
printwriter	objectinputstream	bufferedreader	objectoutputstream	bufferedreader	objectinputstream	bufferedreader	printwriter	objectoutputstream	objectinputstream	objectoutputstream	printwriter
either do all your marshaling manually using the printwriter bufferedreader pair or do it all with object serialization with objectoutputstream objectinputstream

6315479
tclientdataset	bde
the error occurs with both dbx4 or bde components connected to the tclientdataset and thus it is highly likely the issue is a problem with changes to tclientdataset code

6315491
letter-spacing	text-align

6315800
action-filter	onactionexecuting
i have a global action-filter that is setting the masterpage of all viewresults during the onactionexecuting event

6315800
action-filter	onactionexecuting
the problem is that when setting the result like this my action-filter s onactionexecuting method does not fire meaning i do not get the correct masterpage applied

6315800
action-filter	onactionexecuting
one remedy is to move my action-filter logic into onresultexecuting this does fire but i am still confused as to why onactionexecuting does not

6315992
unsigned	short
or you could use an unsigned short if you know you ll never need to represent a number larger than 65 535

6315996
integer	unsigned
using an unsigned type to make sure that you don t get any extra 1s in your integer representation if you intend to use bit shifting operators and

6316009
range	max
for example a signed char 1b has range -128 127 but if it s unsigned - the max value is doubled you have one more bit to use - sign bit so unsigned char could be 255 all bits are 1

6316009
next	except	int	chars
the smallest int except chars is short next one is int etc

6316038
post	get
unless you can get your users to just email the data to you probably the easiest thing to do would be to create a web app possibly with no user facing output since you re just using it to collect data using something like google app engine that gives you a url you can send a post request to using an http request

6316045
tabcontrol	tabitem
xaml with tabcontrol - notice that i hook the loaded event this is where i will add the dynamic tabitem

ant	maven
we have been looking to several alternatives such as sprouts rake maven and ant but it s not being easy to achieve exactly what we want.

6316072

now we have to make sure that we can react properly on get put post and delete

6316072
put	get	post	get	post	put
cases would be get delete put post

6316113
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the effect is working nicely in firefox but not in google-chrome nor safari

6316114
keydown	keyup
you can use the keydown and keyup jquery functions to capture a single key press

6316114
keydown	keyup
the event handler for the keydown and keyup events provides a property which you can read to check for control keys event.altkey for example

min	max
i think you can specify max and or min size not sure though

6316292
for-loop	loops
if i understand the question and you just want to loops over some php code a certain number of times there is no reason a standard for-loop would not work

6316299
hide	show
select show or hide based on an epxression

6316343
mouseout	mouseleave
i did a little research but it seems that different browsers behave differently when it comes to triggering rollout mouseout events when the mouseleave the browser window

6316346
folder	dir
when i configure my template dir like this the app can t file the template folder and files

6316353
put	get	post	get	post	put
instead each resource has its unique url and the http verbs get post put or delete are used on those resources

6316353
put	get	post	get	post	put
best practise in this case would be to use post for creating new resources delete for removing them get for retrieving existing and put to update existing

6316371
onclick	onchange
using the onclick handler on the individual options isn t clearly defined behavior you should change the event to the onchange on the select box itself

6316400
gif	png
source is either png or gif where the pixels that should be colorized are white

6316400

6316621
put	get
you can read innerhtml to get a string of markup from a dom element node but this serialisation is newly-generated markup and won t typically be exactly the same as what you put in.

6316630
for-loop	arrays
if you enumerate for in or for-loop over an arrays it will be ordered

6316670
min	max
i believe the following should keep input1 within min max

6316673
firefox	safari
however in both firefox and safari the photo-title in this case peace memorial park is left out completely

6316675
inherited	properties
since all of your models controllers extend them inherited automatically disperses whatever properties methods you place in them - for example auth

6316676
ready	each
once you have the field ready you can obtain a list of each image that should be put on the field

6316685
width	height
so that would be the video width en height

6316689
min	max
you can use min max like

6316689
min	max
this will allows you to adjust your values and be sure it will be between min and max but never those values

6316778
move	drag
i need the user to be able to drag the rectangles to move or resize them up and down each column of the timetable

6316828
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
you need to implement the uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource protocols

6316875

it uses put or post for editing pages

6316895
profiler	gprof	profiler	callgrind	gprof	callgrind
gprof is an instrumented profiler callgrind is a sampling profiler

6316895
gprof	callgrind
try the free 30 day evaluation of zoom from rotateright - i suspect it will give you a profile which agrees more with callgrind than with gprof

6316920
post	get
however have a look at this post which explains how to get extended data from the tags stored with the file

6316920
width	height
details the file may have its frame width and frame height information filled in

6316924
qframe	qwidget
it turns out if you create your widget as a subclass of qframe instead of a qwidget the background-image property seems to take fine

6316924
qframe	qwidget
if you create your widgets in qt designer or creator they don t have an option to create a qframe-derived widget so i just tell it i want a qwidget-derived class then manually change the .cpp and .h file to derive from qframe instead of qwidget

6316986
folder	directory
since the userlogin control is actually under a folder in the home views directory it s not in the standard search path of where the view engine will search

6316987
typedef	struct
if it makes a difference i usually typedef a struct like so in the .h

6317054
express	node.js
have known node.js and express several days ago

6317082
memcached	apc
simple answer memcached and apc store the data in memory not on the disk

6317089
folder	directory
the build directory has been replaced with a derivedbuilds folder and it uses some obfuscation naming so it s not possible to let an external script find the files

6317146
range	minimum
create a cte that will take the minimum and maximum date values in the table dbo.timescaledata and generate all the time values for every hour between the given range

6317211
superclass	subclassing
it means plainly a subclassing must honor the contract set by the superclass

6317211
implements	extends	super	extends	super	implements
if you extends a super class you should read its document and implements as it dictates

6317225
profiling	instrumentation
i configured the profiling method to instrumentation

6317236
udp	tcp
udp can be used to minimize latency and the retransmission of stale data but as rpgs generally don t employ twitch gameplay tcp ip is normally a better choice

6317242
lsp	principles
the principles of substitution or liskov substitution principles lsp basically states that an object should only be in a hierarchy if in every scenario that object can be used as its parent

6317303
wdm	ndis
ndis filter drivers are typically legacy wdm drivers

6317303
wdm	ndis
ndis filter drivers do not participate in traditional wdm pnp operations they do not handle irps

6317358
width	height
height and width are both 0

6317370
width	height
so i am trying to set an image to be 100 of the height and width of the html element really the browser window is what i m going for

6317370
width	height
and the width behaves right but the height does not change

6317417
memcpy	memmove
also i ve tried to replace memcpy with memmove but with no results

6317462
int	double
say i have 1 million structs each containing int double strings and other structs something like

6317465
post	get
disabled element not appeared at get or post collection

6317467
ssl	https
i ve heard i have to use ssl and https but i don t know how

6317468
post	get
use a urlconnection with setdooutput true and get its output stream for the post

6317477
many-to-many	one-to-many
instead of storing foreign key fields you should store entity fields for one-to-one one-to-many or many-to one mappings or collections of entities for one-to-many many-to one or many-to-many mappings

6317484
width	height
the width and the height of that box are correct but i don t know how to place its top left corner at the top left corner of the string that is drawn on the canvas

6317496
pop-up	dialog
if i make it a normal dialog instead of using qt pop-up flag in constructor then movement is fine with or without editor

6317525
free	malloc
it almost certainly is not working fine it is pointless and in c++ the way you allocate memory is with new and delete not malloc and free

6317591
uitextfield	uitoolbar
create an instance of uitoolbar add whichever views you required in toolbar then assign your toolbar instance in inputaccessoryview property of uitextfield

6317598
move	drag
quite working in xcode and other programs but in iphone simulator i rarely got it working for scrollviews looked like the drag area was not enough to initiate the move especially the horizontal one

6317609
post	get
you don t have to use the querystring you can also get by with the http post collection

6317620
cos	sin
once you launch a ball at an angle say 50 degrees add cos 50 speed to his x position and sin 50 speed to his y position

6317640
post	get
it does not make a difference to struts2 if you post or get as far as setting values

6317668
getter	setter
this line means that the property detaildescriptionlabel will have a setter and getter for the class attribute named _detaildescriptionlabel

6317706
tax	shipping
there are various reasons why tax or shipping options specified in the checkout merchant center are ignored

6317712
ubuntu	debian
installing mono 3.x in ubuntu debian

6317720
width	height
therefore width and height is undefined for inlines

6317723
width	height
but if i keep all picture dimension on same size width and height i get some bug which when player punch

6317760
for-loop	arrays
you can initialize arrays like this or an int arrays and iterate a for-loop over this arrays

6317770
rsa	aes
i understand rsa and aes but where i am lost is in handling attachments

6317792
button	checkbox
it shows how to specify options using drop-downs radio button checkbox

6317809
hide	show
i have not yet dealt with the fact that i may interpret a tap as show hide the status nav toolbars and the uiwebview may act on this same tap as a clicked link etc

6317813
apache	nginx
changing documentroot in apache to var www and passing wiki from nginx doesn t help - mediawiki starts redirection to wiki nginx redirects it back to apache and so on before it says about looped redirections

6317843
rsa	aes
attachments are big files and asymmetric encryption is really slow rsa so it is best to generate an aes key and encrypt it with the rsa public key and then encrypt the attachment with a lot faster aes

6317846
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome 12 firefox 3.6 and 4 and in opera 11

6317846
google-chrome	firefox
the drawing speed is fine in google-chrome and firefox when interacting with the mouse hover and scroll to zoom or when switching properties with the graph controls

6317850
setinterval	settimeout
you could execute a function using the settimeout and setinterval if you want them to execute at a later time

6317865
put	get
and get what i want but i m not sure where in the code above i should put this

6317890
int	chars
i have a code in which the chars array is populated by int converted to chars arrays and read by another function which reconverts it back to int

6317890
int	chars
so are there any other other functions which i can use which can take in the chars array the first bit and the last bit and convert it into the int

6317902
google-chrome	firefox
when i do the upload on firefox everything works out smoothly but on ie9 google-chrome it breaks

6317915
filtering	grouping	inotifycollectionchanged	icollectionview
icollectionview will give you the ability to filtering sort or grouping the collection in addition to propogating inotifycollectionchanged events if the underlying collection implements it

6317915
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
use icollectionview when you need sorting filtering or grouping

6317938
stdout	stderr
the command itself redirects stderr to stdout which gets captured above then stdout to the original stdout from outside the block so only the stderr gets captured

6317966
innodb	myisam
i need to convert around 9 tables in each of 12 dbs from myisam to innodb and i m hoping i can do all the tables in one db with a single query rather than having to click-and-wait for each and every table in phpmyadmin

6318021
rss	feed
i just found a cool web app named full text rss feed it can convert a truncated rss feed to a full text rss feed

6318021
rss	feed
i try this pipe with the same truncated rss feed i just used in that app but got different result

6318021
versioning	upgrade
i also notice that the pipe author will upgrade the versioning to v2

6318045
memcpy	memmove
edit i always forget the simplest things use memcpy memmove for bulk appending pod elements to pre-allocated vectors

6318124
kerberos	ntlm
lack of support for automated windows domain authentication ntlm kerberos

6318138
min	max
it seems that there are two ways to get max min value

6318171
post	get
regarding i just want to get the claims i m interested in from the post and deal with setting auth stuff up myself from there

6318241
google-chrome	safari
remember to use safari or google-chrome

6318244
awt	swing
the most significant issue is that android has its own activity view system instead of swing awt so you will have to redo your entire user interface from scratch

6318270
hide	show
for really large numbers of components which have a too heavy payload for a good performance you could use javascript libraries like jquery to do the show and hide things by the client

6318291
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem none in google-chrome safari but huge in firefox i tried both 3.6 and 4

6318299
width	height
to resize an image proportionally you have to set either the height or width to 100 but not both

6318299
width	height
choosing whether to do height or width depends on your image and container dimensions

6318299
width	height	portrait	landscape
if your image and container are both portrait shaped or both landscape shaped taller than they are wide or wider than they are tall respectively then it doesn t matter which of height or width are 100

6318299
portrait	landscape
if your image is portrait and your container is landscape you must set on the image

6318299
portrait	landscape
if your image is landscape and your container is portrait you must set on the image

6318309
addition	multiplication
we have now turned our multiplication into an addition which is much easier to do

6318314
awt	swing
the painting in awt and swing docs state the following

6318341
teamcity	nant
if having teamcity run solutions and nunit xunit tests proves insufficient you might take a look at nant

6318352
awt	swing
i fear the paint algorithm is pretty hardcoded in swing awt and they only offer different hooks for different purposes

6318352
awt	swing
you can use use this method in swing which would offer what you want but sadly there doesn t seem to be an awt equivalent

6318352
awt	swing
you could try mixing awt swing but that s usually not recommended and may lead to strange behavior in some cases as i hear

6318396
getter	setter
however if i remove the getter and setter from the test string and end up with something like this

6318408
postgresql	mysql
presumably one of those fields is expecting an integer and postgresql is a lot less permissive on this front than mysql

6318419
ddms	adb
windows - preferences - android - ddms - adb connection timeout ms

6318445
google-chrome	firefox
and it worked in both google-chrome and firefox

6318451
free	malloc
free ing malloc memory is pretty safe because it won t touch the object graph

6318453
getter	setter
removing the getter and setter changes the teststring member from being a property to being a field

6318453
getter	setter
you can let the compiler create the backing field automatically by declaring empty getter setter like this

6318458
windows	wow64
so if it is a 32-bit process either by running on x86 windows or wow64 on x64 windows you want the x86 version

6318488
put	get
to get gdk to talk to my ldap server in the first place i put my ldap server s self-signed certificate file in etc openldap cacerts then tweaked my etc ldap.conf file - i changed the uri line to use ldaps and port 636 and then added this line for the cert issue

6318491
google-chrome	firefox
when i run this in addition to the http headers as shown by google-chrome or firefox there is a version htpp 1.1 an entry with key http_version and value http 1.1 is being added to the env hash

6318522
accessor	ivar
using accessor means you never have to worry about how mag is stored internally so you can transparently store it in nsuserdefaults rather than in an ivar

6318525
prepare	execute
if i try to run a straight select execute on con it works fine so the connection is being made but this prepare statement does not work it s not even recognizing prepare as a valid method it seems

6318535
draggable	droppable
i think based on your demo that your draggable is not reverting because it s actually hitting a valid droppable target the #dropzone element in your demo which is essentially the background

6318535
draggable	droppable
you can fix it by not turning that element into a droppable or by making it s drop handler revert the draggable element itself

6318593
mpdf	phpexcel
i have tried generate pdf file from codeigniter using phpexcel mpdf tcpdf and html2pdf but there was a problem for generating more than 1000 rows fetching from mysql

6318611
post	get
i read a post somewhere about using the sid to get the local admin name in case it has been renamed

6318617
getter	setter
the compiler needs to know the object s type because a property can designate any method to be the getter or the setter not just the default pair of name and setname for example this is usual with bool properties

6318617
accessor	properties
so the compiler needs to know what properties this is in order to generate the correct accessor calls

6318628
superclass	subclassing
so say i have a subclassing that extends a superclass

6318628
superclass	subclassing	abstract-class	superclass
i m looking at an example in a book about abstract-class and when they extend it with a non-abstract subclassing the subclassing s default constructor is blank and there s a comment that says the superclass s default constructor will be called

6318638
post	put
with put or post requests sent in different formats it is much easier as the server can check the format and parse it accordingly.

6318659
put	get
if i put it into string object i get an error constant string too long

6318660
next	except
however i am trying to save the core data and call upon that the next time it is run except when i do this the parser runs again and the same items are aggregated in the uitableview again

6318677
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox but not on google-chrome or ie

6318688
post	get
i ve heard something about the curl library that helps sending variables via get or post method

6318696
accessor	properties
make sure that the properties has a valid properties accessor defined

6318696
accessor	properties
keep in mind you can have your own accessor and setters but i think code-sense needs properties to show up the dot notation

6318728
children	parent
i would like to be able to pass any id to a stored procedure and get the entire chain of ids parent and children of that given id

6318732
fseek	fread
im reading a specified chunk of a file with fseek and fread functions and then writing it to another file

6318758
firefox	safari
right now the limit is 8 in most browsers including firefox safari

6318816
parsley	robotlegs
take a look at some frameworks to help you with an mvc approach - i d suggest parsley because it s what i know but i m hearing that robotlegs is also great and possibily more suited to a mobile application

6318823
folder	directory
bin folder used as output directory by the ant build of the android project and is created automatically by android sdk

6318892
gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
java supports the gzip format with the gzipinputstream decompressing and gzipoutputstream compressing

the more advanced ones such as git hg subversion bazaar clearcase bitkeeper darcs perforce etc. all support some form of merge tracking that can make this specific problem significantly easier to solve

6318916
sctp	tcp
you might prefer to branch based on features rather than on customer names as you might have ten customers who need sctp support and the other twenty customers want tcp support instead

6318931
subtract	add
the most obvious thing to do is to add up all the other blocks in the container and subtract that from the container height

6318939
udp	tcp
also please note that i m talking about the tcp connection which is more safe by itself than udp

6318973
udp	tcp
after all that is the whole point of using tcp instead of udp

6318976
cout	cin
after all you said print something here to cout â in the other case you just said read something from cin

6318977
spaces	delimiter
when reading input using the delimiter is spaces by default you can change this though while when printing cout prints till its find 0 which is end of the string

6318977
istream	getline
istream getline - member function of std istream

6318980
udp	tcp
if you use udp and you care about the data actually being received by the other side you need to use ack but if you don t need the speed of udp you should use tcp as it does the acking for you

6318981
cout	cin
the delimiters are different for cin and for cout

6318981
cout	cin
for cin input is split at whitespaces for cout at end of lines

6318996
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both work as expected but ie keeps triggering the error function when using instead of success

6319011
implements	extends
so i basically have an activity a class that extends the glsurfaceview a class presented above that implements the glsurfaceview.renderer and a class that have the game rules etc

6319020
addition	multiplication
in any single addition or multiplication the query optimizer understands that the data already has the same order and this is seen when you group by such expressions too

6319021
put	get
or put the id a get parameter instead of a hidden field just make sure you don t use get method for a form â those should never have any side effects

6319026
width	height
each state and each county has a bounding box which tells me the origin the width and height each is

6319026
subtraction	addition
it seems like it should be straightforward addition or subtraction as the scaling for each item is exactly the same and i m not trying to do any major transformations so i do not believe the cfaffinetransformation family is needed

6319026
post	get
i can post code if necessary but i m not trying to get someone to write my program for me

6319037
pow	sqrt
try 1 sqrt x i.e pow x -1 2 for starters

versioning	upgrade
first of all i can suggest an upgrade of symfony versioning - i use 1.4.11 where you ll have this functionality working from scratch

6319088
pjax	history.js
so you can get pjax to use history.js so that it supports cross browsers

6319088
pjax	history.js
in regards to simpler history.js is the most low-level basic shortest simple thing you can get which will ensure the html5 history api works in all browsers - that s it s aim to be as low-level and compact as possible so other things can extend it the way they want - such as pjax or that gist

6319095
hash	md5
the best approach to store password remembering stuff is storing as md5 hash along with some browser specific data

6319113
udp	tcp
you can use factory pattern to create connection on the basis of the type channel tcp or udp

6319122
des	aes
so in my sample android app i can switch from des to aes to tdes encryption in one line of code

6319132
daemons	systemd
for example the linux auditd 8 audit logging daemons can be configured to place the computer in single-user-mode or halt the systemd completely when there is no more space left for audit logs. audit logs from remote systemd should probably be maintained until it is known that they have been successfully written to centralized log servers

6319170
actionscript	haxe
haxe - similar approach as mxmlc uses haxe instead of actionscript very fast hx - swf

6319185
pseudo-class	visited
note it is possible for style sheet authors to abuse the link and visited pseudo-class to determine which sites a user has visited without the user s consent

6319186
width	height
it should only extend its width and or height depending on the size of content in div.w4

6319193
x86	mips
the c++0x memory model makes guarantees whether you re on x86 or arm or mips or anything else you can come up with

6319216
yacc	bison
gcc used a yacc bison parser once upon a time but it was replaced with a hand-written recursive descent parser at some point in the 3.x series see for links to relevant patch submissions

6319328
express	node.js
express itself uses connect which uses the standard node.js http api

6319340
hash	salt
that is a significant security risk and needs to be done very carefully even if the user database is encrypted and uses hash salt passwords

6319343
src	attr
next inside find there should be a selector not a jquery object and inside attr there should be an attribute name thus a string src not a value presumably src contains something like

6319366
implements	extends
update this wasn t originally my code and i m still familiarizing myself with it but i just discovered that there was a progressrenderer class that extends jprogressbar and implements tablecellrenderer

6319370
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
i am trying to use the mousemove event to track the position of the mouse while the button is pressed but neither mousedown nor mouseup fire an event for the left mouse button

6319509
tcplistener	tcpclient
i m doing async network in c#.net with the tcpclient and tcplistener classes

6319536
single-quotes	double-quotes
you also need to escape your inner single-quotes or use double-quotes instead

6319550
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
tested in newest versions of google-chrome firefox and opera and my blog looks the same and as expected whilst i was working on it needless to say i got a huge surprise when i checked in ie9 and didn t know what to make of it

6319559
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
or you can throw an unchecked-exception something that is or extends runtimeexception

6319564
air	flashdevelop
not yet as complex as flashdevelop but it s a good start and being an air application it runs under linux

6319575
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
as far as front-end web servers go it seems i have three choices nginx apache and lighttpd

6319575
apache	lighttpd
that leaves two choices - lighttpd and apache

6319641
accessor	properties
the properties declaration and the matching synthesize statement will create standard accessor for values named x and y

6319645
post	get
or use the ui dialog to get it with each post

6319651
getter	setter
the default behavior is property int x will reference 2 methods depending if you are using it as an left hand setter or right hand getter operator the default getter will be - int x

6319656
subclass	abstract-class
in the following code abstractiterator is an abstract-class that implements uniquefilter is a subclass of abstractiterator that is not abstract and data is a vector

6319658
accessor	properties
properties means that compiler should create accessor methods if you re using synthesize

6319660
children	parent
so parent expanding parent img children

6319667
apache	lighttpd
under heavy load lighttpd will outshine apache but apache is like a train

6319667
apache	lighttpd
out of the box lighttpd wipes the floor with apache

6319667
apache	lighttpd
under heavy load if configured correctly lighttpd will out preform apache i did some tests a while back and you might see a 200-300 performance increase in requests per second

6319673
freebsd	linux
linux freebsd follow the same abi for x86-64 and another set for 32-bit

6319673
freebsd	linux
but x86-64 abi for windows is different from linux freebsd

6319681
subclass	abstract-class
uniquefilter is a subclass of abstractiterator an abstract-class

6319681
subclass	abstract-class
if you want to create an instance for abstract-class first you create a concrete subclass and create an instance for that and use it

6319721
post	get
so i have the api working where i can get the auth key and post to my fan page

6319726
nginx	lighttpd
if that is the criteria though would actually suggest you use nginx rather than lighttpd

6319740
abstract-class	superclass
its not being instantiated here i.e its just a reference to the instantiated instance returned by vector.iterator with the type being that of a superclass of the actual returned type which happens to be an abstract-class

6319789
super	abstract
a head-of-state even though abstract in language and existence is a super class or super category of titles like sultan president premier prime minister beloved father etc

6319816

i have written a short article on the similar topic that deal with dynamically populating gridview column based on the columns selected by the user in the checkboxlist control

6319851
portrait	landscape
uiimagepickercontroller camera preview is portrait in landscape app

6319851
portrait	landscape
also have a look at my answer on related question how do you make it portrait only or landscape only it might help you as well

6319889
post	get
if and when i get this right it would be nice to have all the notes in one place the long post

6319941
uiview	subviews
i haven t tried it exactly you can create a uiview object in your class implementation and then add it as a subviews and then assign it to your instance variable your class using dot operator and then release the previously created uiview object

6320007
post	get
however i am unable to get it to post hashtags in the text area

6320019
google-chrome	firefox
this is getting even easier now that firefox and google-chrome have plugins that allow human users to click on hyperlinks in non-html types

6320036
min	max
in cases like this we want to have another table and use cross apply like the following example that uses table numbers that stores all the numbers between min x yourstepinminutes and max x yourstepinminutes and two more numbers around min and max

width	height
outer rectangle is the real width and height of my image

6320124
post	get
use the post redirect get pattern

6320137
setinterval	settimeout
if you know the remainder time of the valid session you could pass it to javascript which could settimeout if the number is small enough or setinterval

6320158
width	height
note that if you are using the system chrome for your air application the height width of the os chrome bars is in addition to the stage width height

6320158
width	height
thus if you set the stage s height width to maximum - it will definitely cause a problem

6320158
width	height
i don t use windows 7 so can t give you the numbers - but what you can do is drag the window to the middle of the screen click a snap check the height and width of top and left side of os chrome in paintbrush

6320158
width	height
now deduct the same from and also for bottom and right from the stage height width

6320174
memcached	apc
apc is a local machine cache specific to php and memcached is a multiple-computer distributed cache

6320181

6320531
post	get
you will see that i am using a form for each link because i want to use post throughout the entire site with no get

6320564
post	get
for accessibility i suggest you just convert all get vars to post vars by including the snippet below on top of your script

6320564
post	get
it converts all get vars to post vars

6320584
multiplying	add
these are the same methods used to perform these functions by hand or in the head. to multiplying just repeatedly add the number

6320584
multiplying	add
when i try to calculate a root by hand i usually use the guess method start with an approximate number add a fraction multiplying see how far off it is add a smaller fraction multiplying check again and repeat until satisfied

6320629
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome internet explorer mozlla opera

6320643
division	multiplication	division	subtract
note however that you don t normally want to implement multiplication by just repeatedly adding or division by just repeatedly subtract

i don t think you ll see an appreciable speed difference between epoll and libevent libev

6320758
portrait	landscape
when i am running xcode the splash image appears in portrait mode only but the view is in landscape mode only

6320761
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout work by modifying the opacity of the element as a whole

6320761
fadein	fadeout
so this concept of fading in individual aspects of an element doesn t apply to fadein and fadeout

6320761
fadein	fadeout
if you want to go the fadeout fadein way and you really want it to take a full second as you said in your previous question which seems like a really long time here s how

would it work just go through the file structure starting in the uploaded root directory or should i modify the script to generate and send a xmlfile over the folder structure and then use the xmldatasource

6320941
jobs	cron
to manage asynchronous tasks you ll have a lot of way a subprocess check on all your requests that some async jobs are waiting a separate cron job a call on a cron.php script from a crontab even psynnott answer with an external script relaunching himself at the end

6320946
draggable	droppable
i m using jquery ui s draggable and droppable to facilitate this

2.if you don t want use bsonknowntypes attribute there is another way to notify serializable about know types it might encounter during deserialization

6320990
width	height
if you changing the controls width and height you are able to adjust the line

6321012
opera	firefox
it s worth pointing out that with any javascript debugger such as the inspector in webkit firebug for firefox or dragonfly on opera it s trivial to change the value of variables on the client side even if your code is in a closure

6321014
jar	war
but i wonder whether this is possible in a more elegant way i want to place the shared library jar inside a web service war which i deploy and then access that library from another war i deploy on the same application server

c can be anything - int double etc

6321222
outputstream	inputstream
use inputstream and outputstream instead

6321236
formtastic	simple-form
i would most definitely recommend to use either formtastic or simple-form

6321258
dbcontext	objectcontext
objectcontext for version 4.0 when using a designer generated model and dbcontext with a 4.1 code first model

6321286
pow	math.h
a further advantage of cmath over math.h is that with cmath you get a std pow overload for each floating point type whereas with math.h you get pow powf etc

6321316
hash	md5
in given requirements stands that password mustn t been sent to server but only md5 hash

6321332
opera	firefox

6321525
for-loop	loops
the most common form of a for-loop is using a new variable as loops counter and loops from zero up to but not including an upper limit

6321525
for-loop	loops
that is how a for-loop is commonly used and people will easily understand what loops is doing

6321544
nfa	dfa
the advantage of nfa s over dfa s is the property to always choose the right path

6321544
nfa	dfa
since you cannot say in an algorithm to choose the right path usually a conversion from nfa to dfa works creating dfa states that symbolize multiple nfa states

6321544
nfa	dfa
thus when your nfa is in state a and has the choice to go to a b or c then the next state in your dfa would be a b c

6321553
inherited	properties
you can create new calss and inherited it from the current class the new class can have the on the fly properties and base class functionality

6321577
inherited	properties
what you can is to create a new class which can inherited from existing class and add the properties to that

6321586

phpunit	simpletest
i tried simpletest and it works well as in both the cases but phpunit only works on commandline

6321868
phpunit	simpletest
when i run simpletest from editor it runs as php command but phpunit will have to run through phpunit command

6321868
phpunit	simpletest
is it also possible to run phpunit without installing through pear and just like simpletest - where we just copied the folder and included the autorun file

6321874
portrait	landscape
im building a calculator app with friend and when i was starting the landscape layout i realized that the app would crash immediately on launch after the oncreate method because it was looking in the portrait xml fil i commented out the portion of the method that made up the new buttons and now it runs but i cant use the new buttons that i declared in the landscape xml file

6321887
button	checkbox
i have a button that the user can click but i want that disabled until the user has clicked in one of the checkbox

6321887
button	checkbox
is there some way that i can sense the user having clicked in a checkbox and then change the state of the button from disabled disabled if this has happened

6321894
portrait	landscape
it will then duplicate your xml so you can redesign your landscape mode without messing up portrait mode

6321904
button	checkbox
you could subscribe for the click event of all those checkbox and once the user clicks on one of them enable the button

6321909
children	parent
note that it would be a significant improvement if you could give the input elements a class or if you could specify a common parent element that had no other input children

6321934
google-chrome	firefox
in my tests of what i actually think you re doing google-chrome firefox ie6 ie7 and ie9 did string#indexof fastest

integer	unsigned
always expect the size of the message as a unsigned 32-bit integer as the first 4-bytes then read until you ve filled that amount of data

6322270
int	double	int	chars
if you want to being able to compare double float int int and chars then use ord

6322289
button	checkbox
it will attache a change event to the set of checkbox and trigger a change when the page is loaded so the button will be disabled by default

6322289
button	checkbox
if there is any checkbox checked it will leave the button enabled otherwise it will disabled the button

6322294
screens	tablet
if you are supporting tablet screens sizes a likely element would be

6322335
serializable	deserialization
generally if you want to use deserialization try to first use serializable to understand how must a valid xml look like

6322347
google-chrome	safari
while it s working fine in safari and google-chrome it s not working in ff4 all on mac

6322354
centos	linux
if you re using rhel fedora centos scientific linux then you need to install libxml2-devel

clang	llvm
iâ m trying to set the header search path in xcode 4 using llvm 2.0 clang as compiler in a c++ command line project so that i can include a library header file via

6322594
int	chars
in this case the conversion specifier chars see below is replaced by the sequence n where n is a decimal int in the range 1 nl_argmax giving the position of the argument in the argument list

6322606
int	chars	division	modulo
the only other option i can think of is to either iterate the chars and check or cast the number to an int and use modulo + division to grab each digit off of the number and compare with the next number in the series

6322620
uiview	uiwindow
but if not then you can find all the uiview shown on top of the uiwindow and then check if any of the uiview is kind of class that is showing actionsheet

6322675
fullscreen	minimized
on some windows systems when i press the escape key the program will exit fullscreen mode and minimized

6322680
google-chrome	firefox
i found in testing that it only worked really well in firefox 4 and recent google-chrome builds but ymmv

but i could see someone writing a function that turns all of your uilabel in your uiview into uitextview so the user can edit the text

6322787
daemon	cron
in combination with the capistrano restart recipe it s quite convenient to use cron to also start the delayed_job daemon at startup using the special reboot time in a crontab

6322787
daemons	systemd
not sure if all implementation of cron actually only run reboot at systemd startup but at least ubuntu seams to only run them at start up and not whenever the cron daemons start or restart

6325016
google-chrome	safari
i have tested it on google-chrome and safari

6325075

6325234
mousemove	mouseup
it depends on how much you want to take advantage of built-in dnd functionality but for a solution that is portable you could look at something like this page but i would change it so that when you click on the player it adds the mousemove event handler and on mouseup this would be removed

6325325
opera	safari
this includes ie6 7 firefox1 2 3 opera konqueror safari and probably others

6325378
ready	each
keep in mind it uses a lot of distributed computing and not a simple db lookup and probably caches the first n results for any query and also html ready results for each result page and intermediate results see dynamic programming

6325392

the suggested fix is to instead of using setinterval blindly use the callback function of the animation to trigger restart with a settimeout

mouseup	mousedown
so i do a left mousedown when capslock is switched on then a left mouseup when capslock is switched off

firstly i have done much googling and checking other stackoverflow post about this but cannot get a working reply or a snippet of working code

6325699
width	height
i have found this way to do it but i don t know how to obtain screen width and height to fill it in the createbitmap parameter s list

6325701
put	get
as for storage of all the values you already have them in the xml document so you might consider a function that returns the values as you need them or get them all in a loop and store them in an object but then you likely have to loop over the objet to get them back just like you did in the first place to put them in there

6325704
rss	feed
p.s i do not want to use a library or server side scripting also a json object is not available from the rss feed i am using and i do not want to create one in php.

6325735

since rspec doesn t have a scenario method i m guessing that you re using capybara or steak and that it s really just an alias for it

6325772
d3.js	protovis
there s a tutorial that covers the differences between d3.js and protovis in some detail

6325842

6325959
gitolite	gitosis
first i would suggest using gitolite as gitosis is no longer actively developed

6325965
width	height
the createbitmap call only requires the desktop width and height if the image you wish to save is actually the entire size of the screen

6325965
width	height
if that s indeed your intent you can use cwnd getdesktopwindow to get a cwnd object that you can query for its width and height

6326005
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undeï ned

i m suggesting these two versus some of the other well-known frameworks cakephp codeigniter because common consensus is that they re easier to extend which quickly becomes invaluable

6326419
width	height
works fine but the problem is that if i resize the window to less than the width 1400 or height 900 of the photos the scrollbar appears

6326438
width	height
you should be able to set the height and width to 100 and set overflow hidden

6326470
temp	tmp
i had to save the page as a temp file to parse then output the way i wanted with no text then i just did unlink tmp at the bottom to delete the file

strcpy	strncpy
i use strcpy strncpy to do this but my program crashes when i go to use strncpy it compiles but crashes at runtime

6326669
strncpy	malloc
to fix this you should use malloc to allocate some memory to variable before calling strncpy

6326669
free	malloc
note that anytime you allocate memory such as with malloc you must be prepared to free it when you are done

6326675
client-side	server-side
there are 2 kinds of redirects client-side server-side

6326693
uitableview	uisearchbar
ios api has a beautiful feature which allows a developer to load data lazily in a uitableview which used along with uisearchbar can be used as autocomplete when a user scrolls down

6326733
hash	md5
rather than depending on byte size of two images you could create md5 hash or other hash algorithms of those images and compare the hash values

6326756
width	height
the inner scroll view would have contentsize of the actual content and its actual dimensions would be screen width and the same height as contentsize

6326769
firefox	safari
i created a slideshow that works fine in the latest versions of firefox safari and ie

6326832
stdout	stderr
the part that confused me was the mixing of stdout and stderr led to them being interleaved and the which prints out from and error || warning to the next empty line was printing out a lot more than expected which made it seem like the command wasn t working

6326900
listview	gridview
in this they have used a listview in the layout so the images and the corresponding text are shown as list items you can change that listview to a gridview something like this

to determine cache misses you ll want a cpu-level profiling like oprofile or vtune or a dynamic instrumentation tool like valgrind with cachegrind

6337662
jar	manifest.mf
in your jar file you should have a file called manifest.mf under folder meta-inf

6337662
jar	manifest.mf
you can open the jar file using winzip or winrar and edit the manifest.mf directly just to test but in reality you should have it outside together with the classes you are packaging in the jar so that each time you generate the jar file you include it with the rest of the classes

6337666
google-chrome	firefox
i only tested this in google-chrome firefox and ie9

6337703

one solution could be assuming that this would even work to load the video first without specifying a height and width but using css to hide the video calculate the dimensions destroy the video and load it again on click using the right size

6337703
width	height
alternatively you could make a server-side script php asp ... that reads the video file detects the height and width when you content is originally saved and save the height and width to a database

6337703
width	height
you would then be able to read the height and width from the database on every page view

6337703
width	height
another thought another solution could be to not specify the height and width in the embed code and let the browser size the video on it s own

6338373
jar	war
if you re running in a java ee container like jboss 6 and i really recommend so all you need is to package your beans into a jar place a meta-inf persistence.xml inside it and place the jar into your war or ear package

hide	show
i pushed to github a trimmed down version of what i want to do hide and show layouts so you can see everything but the problem seems to boil down to myview still being visible after this

6338472
hash	salt
now the salt is there to stop precomputed lookups of hash hashing itself is not enough any more people have precomputed hash of dictionary words and more

6338472
hash	salt
when you want to check passwords you would take the user input get the salt for that user generate the hash for the supplied password and stored salt and then compare

6338472
hash	salt
i should of course point out the asp.net membership functions do salt and hash so they should probably be a first point of call

6338501
width	height
the general technique is to use the 3-argument version of bitmapfactory.decoderesource with bitmapfactory.options#injustdecodebounds for a first-time-pass in order to get the width height of the bitmap although in your case since it comes from the app s resources there s no reason you should even have to do that

6338506
inherited	properties
the whole point of prototypal inherited is that you define an interesting object that is with all the behavior you want and then clone it with object.create and modify the clones to suit your needs usually by modifying its properties not its methods

6338511
google-chrome	firefox
everything is ok in google-chrome and firefox

6338541
nstextview	nsscrollview

if you put a myproject.cache.bar into the cache with a key of b then you rename the class to myproject.cache.foo because by default items stay in the cache indefinitely when you try to get out the item with a key of b you get a can t find file error

6338837
post	get
get post are all asynchronous

6339781
16-bit	64bit
i guess this is a bit like asking why we often have 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64bit integer datatypes byte int long whatever but not 24-bit ones

width 100 is highly affected by its margin and margin and padding of its parent body in your case

width	margin
so if you create a div with width 500 pixels then nest another div inside with width 100 your 100 div can expand to a maximum of 500 pixels not counting any padding or margin so you need to reset them to 0

hash	salt
if your attacker already knows your way of computing the salt hash we can safely assume he either has access to your db which would necessarily store the salt as well a dump of it or access to plaintext communication between your app and a client

6345083
hash	salt
to then crack the hash he would simply replicate your sha1 salt

6345083
hash	salt
he d take the salt from you db and compare the result of the hashed-salted-hashed password to the salt hash stored in the same db

6345083
hash	salt
instead of running a wordlist against a single hashing function with a single salt he ll have to run the entire wordlist against every single hash pw in your database

6345083
hash	salt
that said if the attacker is far enough into your system to actually acquire the hash salt it would be much easier for him to alter your code to send him plain text copies of credentials of users logging in in the first place

it didn t appear until sometime in the last few years but i m unsure whether binutils or the glibc dynamic linker ld-linux.so.2 is responsible for the change

6346636
dlsym	dlopen
it s possible that it s a complete map of the while library file so that the dynamic linker can make it readable again at some time in the future perhaps during dlopen or dlsym calls to access elf metadata that doesn t normally need to be mapped

6346638
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven application and configured the pom.xml to run the mvn jetty

your clients will then send their data over a outputstream to your server which will process them do whatever is necessary and then send them back to the other listening devices using an inputstream on the client side

6347058
free	malloc
i usually like to write free in my code immediately after i write malloc and then put whatever code i need in between

6347065

to allow for this i have to handle the onrowupdating event of the gridview and set cancel in the gridviewupdateeventargs to true since the sqldatasource has no update command defined

6347094
width	height
if your real problem is my radio buttons are too small to touch with the particular setup i have here and you can t convince your device to scale things up by specifying a width and height in css your best bet would probably be to emulate radio buttons using javascript and your own images and a hidden form field

6347181
int	double
you should read about java specs to understand how double int strings are written in data output stream

6347210
for-loop	arrays
use something like this to convert the string to a byte arrays then use a for-loop to put those bytes into the byte arrays that is your message buffer and to zero-fill if necessary

6347244
button	checkbox
this seems not to be an official property of a button not a button-style checkbox

6347250

6347261

you can use a bitarray to pack the boolean into an int

6347343
int	boolean
a byte can hold up to 8 boolean an int up to 32

6347343
int	boolean
to hold up to 16 boolean you could use a byte array with two bytes or a single int depending on whether the overhead of an array or the unused bits in the int take up more space

6347343
int	boolean
to get the boolean back you create a bitarray from an array of byte or int

6347345
super	extends
bison and super bison must inherit or extends from a common class

6347353
polymorphism	specialization
at compile-time static polymorphism this can be done quite nicely with function overloads and or template specialization

if you set use_ssl as true you can use https and default value of verify_mode is set as openssl ssl verify_peer

6347515
many-to-many	one-to-many
you could probably do it with a linking table but you d have to enforce one-to-many via code otherwise it could easily become a many-to-many

6347515
children	parent
the jist of the linking table would be that it keeps the association between the parent and its children rather than the child object itself

6347534
put	get
get rid of that and you ll be able to put in some real code

6347535
textview	imageview

post	get
i can successfully query the unauthenticated calls ie get the top news stories using restsharp and hammock but i want to be able to post comments with my digg client on windows phone

6347703

what i personally would do is push data to your clients and not pull data from them which seems what you re planning to do that way you d only have to send data whenever someone logs in or a new message appears - both situations that should happen not that often

6347725
google-chrome	firefox
open it in google-chrome and firefox you will see the difference

6347736

6348093
google-chrome	firefox

for example you could store your thumbnails to the filesystem in a directory structure like width height filename which would be easier to check for in a rewrite rule than modified-filename-width-height.gif

6348229
post	get
you may want to examine why you want to preserve get or post variables

6348229
post	get
as a side note never trust get or post data to be what you expect it to be in the context of security

but at the moment i am having a hard time finding any examples on vbscript or jscript networking

6348950
width	height
for left and right margins they refer to the width of the page box while for top and bottom margins they refer to the height of the page box

6349395
put	get	post	get	post	put
your issue is that you do not have a mechanism to get the discussion into the post controller one approach might be to put the discussion id in a hidden field in your partial form and then read it in your controller as a param

6349398
getter	setter
edit a simpler way to do have this functionality is to use properties which are a shortcut that create the getter and setter for a variable for us see this link for a good beginner s tutorial iphone 101 for your instance variables like so

6349451
google-chrome	firefox
to perform the same type of selection manually you can with firefox hold ctrl down and start dragging text in different positions but performing it on google-chrome doesn t work

junit	jmock	junit	easymock	easymock	jmock
to complement junit there are mocking libraries such as jmock and easymock

i ve tried putting resizing code to set this in viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear both these methods etc

if the device accepts flash drives and or hid devices like a mouse or keyboard then host mode is supported

6349841
maven	pom.xml
one of the dependencies to my project has a maven repository listed in its pom.xml that no longer exists

6349846
post	get
when you fetch your last 5 post get the id make sure you re filtering on your post_type field to avoid grabbing things like revisions attachments etc

6349850
ienumerable	ilist
how you loop through the list will of course depend on the type of list you have but as arraylist appears to implement ilist which implements ienumerable then you should have no problem using a foreach var item in list type construct to build the loop

6349853
post	put
i have the following method which calls a post service and it returns xml which i want to put the attributes of the element into a hashmap

6349998
subtraction	multiplication
this only requires subtraction multiplication and comparison no special hardware functions needed

6350005

now i cut a part out of it and save it on a temporary resource which is created by the information of the type if the type is jpg or jpeg i use imagejpeg with png i use imagepng and with gif i use imagegif

6350038
gif	png
jpeg warnings seem to be deactivated but not the warnings for png and gif

6350052
mouse	keyboard
if you really want to do it anyway you ll need to implement low level mouse keyboard hooks

6350111
express	node.js
i plan to use express backbone.js mongodb redis if i choose node.js

6350154
postgresql	mysql
note that right now we re using postgresql but may be moving to mysql in the near future

6350168
vsto	add-in
indeed from your excel-dna add-in you only have access to the excel com object model and not the vsto extensions

6350168
vsto	add-in
however the vsto assemblies just talk to excel through the com interface so in theory you should be able to do the same from your excel-dna add-in perhaps after adding some helper classes

6350241
tiff	png
simply try change the jpeg tiff to pdf png

6350283
post	get
we keep extensive logs in a database containing each request it s variables get post session keys etc

you re also not telling nsstring what kind of encoding you expect your string to be in when it reads it from nsdata

6350347
superclass	subclassing
if your subclassing doesn t reimplement any of the methods of the superclass or if you re fine with ignoring reimplemented methods you can use the functions methods and superclass to find a list of subclassing methods that aren t also methods of any of the superclass

6350350
notepad	textpad
using select all does indeed highlight all the text selecting copy issues no errors but when i go to notepad or word or textpad etc

i have a wpf application that allows users to create questions of all different types which depending on the type will use a textbox combobox checkbox or radio button to allow the user to answer the question after they build some sort of questionnaire

6350417
actionscript	mxml
mxml tags represent components written in actionscript actionscript under the hood

6350417
actionscript	mxml
when you compile a flex flex application the mxml is compiled using adobe s mxmlc compiler into actionscript which is then compiled with the application s actionscript code into a swf swf file

6350417
actionscript	mxml
because of this anything done in mxml could also be written in actionscript

6350469
width	height
it kicks in when drawimage img1 x y width height x or y are not integers

6350469
width	height
and kicks in when the canvas tags width 600 height 600 are larger than the style width 600

6350469
google-chrome	firefox

eclipse ide has support for other important project tools ant and maven for example with m2e plugin so you can learn them too if you want

6350523
google-chrome	firefox
it looks normal on google-chrome firefox and ie9 but for some reasons some of my div lost all background color in ie 7 --

6350560
rvm	bundler
rvm does move this from the usual location and bundler can move it again

6350564
mouseover	mouseout
i don t have time to fully investigate it at the moment but i believe it is caused by one of the strange behaviors of mouseover mouseout that occur with child elements

6350589
onchange	onkeyup	onchange	onblur	onkeyup	onblur
add checkword to the onkeyup attribute of you textbox though i think you d be better using onchange or onblur

6350624
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop represents the arrays of checkboxes

6350641
strcpy	strncpy
idiomatic ways to use strcpy and strncpy

6350641
strcpy	strncpy
any other use of strcpy strncpy is potentially suspicious and you should look at them carefully

6350657
fileinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
i think the fileinputstream conversion to bytearrayinputstream is the problem

6350673
width	height
i am using the stage scalemode as no_scale and want to know the width and height specified in html in the embed tag

6350723
pycrypto	keyczar
so similarly use openssl x509 with correct command line options for you and read it in python else you can try to have a look at pycrypto and google keyczar

6350743
google-chrome	firefox
i can do this in firefox and ie and i know it doesn t exist in google-chrome yet

6350812
sorting	filtering
sorting works but filtering and selection don t work

6350817
ant	maven
both work great with maven and ant and hibernate

6350918
google-chrome	firefox
one online java and a firefox google-chrome extension

6350941
extjs	ext.net
if you re not set on jquery there s ext.net which is a server-side implementation of extjs

6350951
integer	fractions
note that bash can only handle integer arithmetic so if your awk command returns a fractions then you ll want to redesign here s your code rewritten a bit to do all math in awk

6350967
width	height
will give you the total width and height of the swf as it s been embedded into a page or stretched in flash player

6350967
width	height
to simplify working with an swf that can have dynamic width and height i recommend the following as well

6351003

i try to use the viewdidappear and viewwillappear in the first viewcontroller that when i back to this viewcontroller from the second viewcontroller i will enter one of this method

6351061
git-rebase	amend

6351071
client-side	server-side
codeigniter is a server-side framework so it cannot intermingle with a client-side framework.

6351095
post	get
edit i need to clarify i referred to first validating and then blindly passing info through get or post to database logic.

6351096
serializable	deserialization	children	parent
gson does not currently have a built in mechanism to handle bi-directional references during serializable or deserialization except that for serializable fields in children referencing parent can be selectively excluded with the resulting json then lacking the parent reference data in the child or custom serializable processing can replace the parent reference with a new json element and for deserialization it s possible to implement custom processing along the lines m.j

6351098
codeigniter	cakephp
it can take a while to get used to this concept so if it is difficult to grasp at first i d suggest starting off with a php framework that forces mvc file separation like codeigniter or cakephp

6351174
geany	notepad++
use something lightweight like notepad++ geany or similar

6351198
width	height
if you want to resize your font characters along with the textfield stretch or skew the text you should either use the scalex or scaley properties instead of width and height or create a container sprite add the textfield as a child to it and resize the entire container instead of the textfield

6351209
post	get
this is working great atm save for one snare if you get the date you have a paged resultset page numbers under the grid if you then post and get new data then click on any of the page numbers the grid reloads with the original resultset and with the original paging

6351234
switching	screens
when you choose amongst the different categories of news only the view below changes it doesn t switching to a completely new screens activity

6351346
width	height
you get x y coordinates for your touch event and you can easily get the width and height of the view so you could just logically split into quadrants yourself

6351367
width	height
is it possible to have an div with an iframe inside of it autosize the width and possibly height - without - the use of javascript

6351378
inherited	properties

6351536
super	self
super b self .go calls the next method in the method resolution order

6351542
directx	gdi
however it s probably better advised to get a genuine graphical api for this purpose such as gdi directx or opengl

6351570
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
my code does work right now after i changed those elements to be using getelementbyid i was just wondering why getelementsbytagname presented such behavior

6351612
hide	show
this way i would be able to call show and hide of the dialog on the dialog viewmodel from inside the customer viewmodel and alter the dialog viewmodel as needed

6351612
getter	setter
there would be a few lines of codebehind for the dialog view but very little and pretty dumb setter getter with almost no code

6351616
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
getelementsbytagname gets elements by their name getelementbyid gets the element by its id

6351616
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
there may be many elements on a page with the same name hence getelementsbytagname always returns a list of elements but there is must only be one element with a given id therefore getelementbyid only returns a single element

6351637
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear and viewdidappear are notoriously shaky on ios

6351671
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
if you use getelementbyid you should use element to access the element and if you use getelementsbytagname you should use

6351737
selecteditem	selectedindex
when i said visually i mean that i get correct object and index when i take selecteditem or selectedindex property of my custom list

6351794
spaces	linefeed
most browsers transform linefeed characters into a spaces

6351883
nsstring	nsdata
you could use nsstring s initwithdata encoding to convert it to an nsstring if necessary or you could access the nsdata s bytes and interpret them as a possibly not terminated c-style string

6351911
sorting	grouping
the cvs will be used as proxy and on it you can have grouping and sorting capabilities

6351913
width	height
it also helps to apply a set width and height to the containing div instead of using this jquery work around for setting the width of the overlay

6351921
multicastdelegate	delegation
if one type is a delegation the other must not also be a delegation type nor object delegation nor multicastdelegate

6351923
implements	extends
it is better to first extends the original interface with your own interface eg with additional methods like hasprev and then implements the newly created interface in your class

6351960
width	height
you just have to adjust the values accordingly make imagedata point to the top-left pixel of the sub-rect and set width and height to the width and height of the sub-rect

6351966
google-chrome	safari
has some issues in google-chrome and safari

6351985

6351992
umbraco	examine
i am using umbraco cms and trying to use its site search function that uses examine

6351993
division	multiplication
this is because transparency involves a lot of multiplication and division to blend the pixel colours while drawing opaque colours is simply a matter of overwriting the old pixels

6352019
pop-up	dialog
larger ads tend to have higher cpms but are more intrusive and harder to fit on a phone window unless you have a dedicated ad activity dialog pop-up sort of thing

put	get
this means you will get alternating put and get output assuming the output stream does not do some reordering

6358275
put	get
this differs a bit from synchronousqueue in that here the producer can proceed if the queue was empty before and the consumer can proceed if it was full before while for synchronousqueue it would wait until the consumer is ready to take it which means put and get are always overlapping in time and can t be called on the same thread

int	chars
when it converts the signed chars to signed int it doesn t say this would be 220 if it s unsigned it says this is -36 make it an int of -36 for which the 32-bit two s complement representation is ffffffdc because it must be the negative value for the full size of int this is called sign-extension

screens	hdpi
you can have 800x480 resolution but with screens of 10 you will not have hdpi

6364958
strcpy	malloc
you can also let c remain a pointer then use malloc to allocate a buffer storing the buffer s address in c and then use strcpy to copy the static string into the buffer

6364966
screens	hdpi
but any screens that has a 800x480 resolution most likely draws from the hdpi folder thats why you re seeing it blurry

in most cases particularly if the performance problem is easy to reproduce a profiling is the most effective tool for that as it will give you detailed statistics on execution time breaking it down to single methods without having to manually instrumentation your program

6365666
punctuation	words
words are broken by punctuation a space or being at the start or end of a line

6365684

there s probably a much better way to get at the post you care about but we ll need more information about what you re trying to do

6365686
fftw	fftpack
the fftw site shows fftpack running about 1 3 as fast as fftw but that s with a mechanically translated fortran-to-c step followed by c compilation and i don t know if numpy scipy uses a more direct fortran compilation

6365693
nsurl	nsstring
otherwise the following is mine a category on nsstring modeled after the new bookmark apis available in nsurl which require 10.6

6365711
superclass	subclassing
a uiview subclassing already has its own designated initializer which is - id initwithframe so calling - id init on any subsequent subclassing of contentview is not going to update any instance variables since directs to nowhere or better first the superclass runs initwithframe and only then it runs init which is the same as having done nothing

6365723
width	margin
after fussing with fredrik hedblad s most recent 1 1 11 solution for some time i figured out that the converterparameter value should be 6 + left margin + right margin margins of the outermost container in the template. after examining a blowup of a screen shot i expect the 6 is the width of the vertical bar at the left of each row

6365726
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m using javascript to do this and it works in firefox safari opera and google-chrome but not ie

6365747
profiler	visualvm	profiler	perf
once you start to isolate the bottlenecks then the next steps will start to feel more natural fine tuning your tests will become easier you may choose at that point to hook up a profiler to investigate gc cpu perf and memory consumption visualvm is good and free .the point is treat performance issues like a binary search

6365775
octal	decimal
according to the c++ standard in lex.icon integer literals can be split in 3 types decimal literals octal literals and hexadecimal literals each of which can have a suffix for signess and length type

6365775
octal	decimal
decimal literals must start with a nonzero digit while octal literals start with 0 and hexadecimal literals have 0x and 0x after the prefix for octal-literals and hexadecimal-literals any digit that is not representable in the corresponding base should trigger a compilation error such as 09 that causes error c2041 illegal digit 9 for base 8 and in other compiler prog.cpp 6 15 error invalid digit 9 in octal constant since if the integer literal is not representable the program becomes ill-formed

6365781

we are keeping the changed links into an arrays called changedarr and when back is clicked triggered because it sents back as the second argument we are doing a for-loop in the changedarr and remove everything that follows the last occurance of ..

6366167
width	height
for instance if i determine the point is drawn at screen point 100 150 i could set the quad for the first character in the point s label to be the rectangle starting with left-top point of 105 155 and having a width of 6 pixels and a height of 12 pixels as appropriate for the particular character

the following script gets html from ajax call - html displays fine by itself in browser - i use innerhtml to put it within div i get javascript error

6366543
gzipinputstream	objectinputstream
most concrete implementations like bufferedinputstream gzipinputstream objectinputstream etc

i tried to implements customconverter or extends dozerconverter but dozer passes me integer type as source and destination class and expect integer as result

6366651
getter	setter
with that name i just call setter or getter method in my converter

6366674
int	double
you are suffering from float double values being demoted to int so any 0.nn gets truncated to 0

6366695
inherited	properties
the downside is that you have to specify what properties you want to inherited

6366723
pull	push
they effectively just screen scrape the green screen terminals to allow you to pull and push data and provide macro recording and editing tools to automate the process

6366743
bufferedreader	fileoutputstream
i ve been using filereader bufferedreader bufferedinputstream and fileoutputstream classes

6366746
onclick	onsubmit
onclick or onsubmit use javascript confirm and only continue on true result

6366754
freemarker	velocity
so i am thinking of looking at other options freemarker minitemplator maybe even velocity

6366775
width	height
the way i have the program set up at the moment you have to manually set the width and height of the pixels

6366775
width	height
if the width and height of the pixels is too large it simply wont work

6366775
width	height
so basically what i want to do is have a function to automatically set the width and height to the size of the picture

6366776
width	height
i want to pack the jtextarea to the minimum possible height given a specified width

6366779
jqplot	flot
flot jqplot etc

6366894
clang	llvm
apple llvm compiler should be available under developer usr bin clang

6366971
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if it s not css as you say use firebug with firefox or in google-chrome or safari or ie8 use the developer tools to see what javascript is loading on your site and what scripts which are duplicates

6366984
ant	maven
it smells a bit but i ve ended up using the maven ant plugin to run the maven ant task to get the job done

6367082
width	height
the easiest and most compatible way would be to trigger it on resize and then just change the width or height of the frame

6367121
width	height
this will reduce the width as well height ..

6367123
post	put
the other thing i wasn t crazy about was having to manually put in admin post

6367145
viewdidload	viewdidappear
when the main uiview loads it invokes viewdidload viewdidappear

6367224
addition	multiplication
if there was a mathematical correspondence operators overloading can make a class more convenient to use by allowing equations to be expressed in the form a b + c rather than the more verbose a.multiply b .add c where addition and multiplication operators are used addition and multiplication should be the intent

6367226
onclick	onsubmit
onsubmit goes on the form not on the submit button try using type button instead in an onclick event

6367227
rss	feed
i have an activity in my app which displays rss feed and next to each rss feed arrow image is attached

then the second form will hide itself and show the first form when you switch back

6367459
portrait	landscape
i want all 3 views in portrait form and only one landscape form

6367470
int	chars
in response to your second question the chars stores the decimal value 90 as chars are really 1-byte int

6367523
portrait	landscape
if i understand your question correctly and please correct me if i do not then you want to have 3 views in portrait all of the time and one view in landscape all of the time

6367526
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you use dynamically allocated memory with malloc you can use realloc to resize the memory region or allocate a new region copy the data into it and free the old one

6367554
mdpi	hdpi
each state should have a nine-patch .9.png drawable in each density ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi

6367582
realloc	malloc
don t forget to check if malloc or realloc returns null

6367598
screens	hdpi
but i have doubt that on normal screen- hdpi itself we have 3 screens sizes

6367604
hash	salt
on linux distributions using glibc2 the hash function has a magic bit and salt prefixed to it

6367604
hash	salt
b salt and hash password as explained above

6367692
getter	setter
also you would benefit more from studying basic oo stuff about encapsulation the getter and setter in my examples

6367730
google-chrome	safari
if you re using a webkit-based browser safari google-chrome it actually animates between the two using a webkit animation

6367765
int	double
to be polymorphic f must be able to operate with values of at least two distinct types int and double finding and executing type-appropriate code

6367831
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
you are not supposed to free any addresses but those returned by malloc calloc or realloc

6367831
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
the free function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

6367831
free	malloc
even if you could use free on any pointer that points to a malloc d memory - your could would free it twice since you are calling free on more than one memory inside that area

6367836
switching	screens	width	height
i switching to the version that uses a rect for the destination which allows me to specify exactly where on the screens my graphic gets drawn including height width

6367841
children	parent
second of all you would probably be best correctly defining the relationships between entities in the edmx and you probably won t have to join at all instead you can use navigation properites to access parent children and filter on those properties directly

6367850
post	get
i also agree with you presto that your post is a little hard to get at times x

6367850
spaces	delimiter
the most typical word delimiter is the spaces but things like hyphens commas and periods are obviously delimiter as well

6367855
strdup	malloc	strdup	calloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	strdup	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	strdup	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
otherwise if the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc posix_memalign realloc strdup function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behavior is undefined

6367856
folder	directory
using ant scp i can able to copy a file from local system windows to server linux .so what i need is i want to create a folder by the system date at specified directory in linux system using ant and copy the file to the folder which created

6367867
rss	feed
i have an activity in my app which displays rss feed and next to each rss feed arrow image is attached

6367890
int	double
in some languages like c++ compiler-supplied support for run-time polymorphism virtual dispatch is specific to oop whereas other types of polymorphism can also operate on data types that aren t objects not struct or class instances but may be builtin types like int or double

6367893
outputstream	inputstream
now with outputstream writers and their inverse classes inputstream readers it is often useful in addition to wrap a bufferedwriter around them

6367924
margin	height
but that would mean you d have to know the height of the second div to make up for that exact amount using negative margin

6367943
clang	llvm
i want to run an example plugin for clang llvm

6367943
clang	llvm
specifically llvm tools clang examples printfunctionnames

6367944

6367950
getter	setter
and msg is the object of message class which has getter nd setter method

6367964
for-loop	arrays
here i pass user_page_id arrays into a for-loop and call facebook api

6367977
folder	directory
we have a folder called notrestricted in the directory where we run application from

6367990
width	height
this class also has a property body avbody which is used to define the x y width height etc of the object which in turn positions the skin

6368103
post	get
if the user allows your app you will get a auth token which you can use in the background to post any message on to the users wall

6368150
for-loop	loops
continue jumps straight to the top of the innermost loops where the per-iteration code and continuance check will be carried out sections 3 and 2 of the for-loop

6368169
for-loop	loops
the continue statement will execute the increment part of the for-loop then the test part and then decide whether to execute the next iteration or leave loops

6368173
post	get
if security is the main concern exclusively use https and post never http and get

6368175

i managed to solve this by adding an uicontrol as a subviews in the uiview

6368184
client-side	server-side
could be server-side or client-side

6368227
getter	setter
as for directly accessing attributes it s actually encouraged in python for simple classes instead of writing explicit getter and setter

6368250
post	get
post requests are no safer than restful requests which are no safer than get requests

6368424
hash	salt
wondering if anyone has some quick links to code snippets to generate a random salt that s not easy too easy to guess and then hashing some plain text password with the generated hash

6368446
oncreate	onstart
that means that trying to check oncreate onstart or even onresume will probably not get the results that you want

6368481
maven	pom.xml
in maven central repo are only spring 1.x and spring 2.x versions and adding to pom.xml don t change anything

rvm	bundler
i m using gem 1.8.5 bundler version 1.0.15 rvm 0.1.46 ruby-1.9.2-p0 x86_64 and rails 3.0.8 on a macbook

6368518
hash	salt
it just has to be unique so that if two people share the same password the salt applied to the password ensures that they don t end up with the same hash value and to reduce the effectiveness of rainbow attacks where a reverse hash dictionary is used to see the possible plain text value s that can produce a particular hash value

6368526
hide	show
you could use something along the lines of this to show hide content

6368615
min	max
i have no syntax at hand but try something along group by min sender_id receiver_id max sender_id receiver_id so that both cases will result in the same combination no matter if sender and receiver are switched

6368625
getter	setter
this is effectively a getter setter but without requiring users of your class to use methods like p.get_flavour

6368625
getter	setter
it also has advantages over letting a user directly access the data since you can add logic in the getter and setter eg

6368630
hide	show
but if you just want simple show hide functionality you should add a class to your div instead of an id

6368747
screens	tablet
it seems that my problem is not rendering a regular html tablet but a direct render to the screens

6368753
put	get
put the id over there on the this url to get the pictures of the friends now you can merge them using the php gd library functions like imagecopymerge check some tutorials and docs here

6368766
folder	directory
you can find it under tools directory of tfs installation folder

6368829
folder	directory
you can add the file to your project just like your code files and in it s properties select copy to output directory copy if newer to make sure that the file is present in the bin debug folder as well

6368877
post	get
the article you linked in your post solves any networking issues so between that and the above you should be able to get the remote debugger up and running

6368879
folder	directory
if you install your program in windows vista or 7 programms folder you will need admin rights to write into this directory

6368895
ubuntu	linux
i am having a linux ubuntu 10.10 version enabled pc and now as opengl is using shaders instead of fixed functionality

6368917
mef	prism
for example we started a large scale enterprise composite app and used prism then we started to use mef and slowly phased out prism as it wasn t necessary to meet any of the business requirements

6368925
folder	directory
the extension folder should be the ext folder in your php installation directory

6368978

6369512
eventlet	gevent
eventlet or gevent

6369536
interpolation	splines
this is a pretty unsophisticated suggestion admittedly but one obvious hack would be to fit overlapping rather than distinct subsets of points and then interpolation between the resulting splines in the overlapping region

6369541

6369711
post	put
it s probably because http put isn t widely supported by browsers as mentioned in the so post doing a http put from a browser

6369711

portrait	landscape
when user-scalable is no landscape works fine but it doesn t scale to 0.75 in portrait no matter how i set maximum and minimum scale

6370390

as another side note it would be better if fern implements runnable rather than extends thread - you re currently passing one thread to another one s constructor which doesn t make much sense.

to get better answers post only complete code.

using post instead of get as a security measure is simply a use of security through obscurity

6371098
integer	unsigned
now we assemble a 32-bit unsigned integer

6371112
post	get
you ll need to use the blogger api to get post from one blog and create them in another

6371139
getter	setter
make sure you have provided proper getter and setter for your action and also check the tags in your page to see if values being referred are actually exposed

6371191
vb6	vba
you use .net format string not vb6 vba

6371202

i can see in firefox with firebug that the request is not being cached and it also happens in google-chrome

6371299
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
there are waithandle s there are autoresetevent s there are manualresetevent s and so on.

6371301
inherited	properties
one way to do achieve would be to extend the default datagridviewtextboxcell class create a new one inherited this behaviour with some properties like the cursor changing clicking leads to opening a link if it s on the surface the link is on etc

6371342
hide	show
i get the error unknown collection member when i try show or hide a rectangle contains some tables based in this expression

in oncreate you setcontentview r.layout.results and then you establish latitudefield and other references which assuming they do not come back null is fine

6371350
3des	aes
aes or 3des are pretty standard symmetrical key encryptions

6371350
hash	md5
when for instance storing passwords in a database you would hash the password with something like md5 and store it

6371358
jboss	glassfish
if you really need to invoke the map s containskey or containsvalue methods then you need to ensure that you re running a servlet 3.0 compatible container like tomcat 7 glassfish 3 jboss 6 etc and that your web.xml is declared conform servlet 3.0

6371383
fadein	hide
for some reason chaining the hide and fadein calls together can make it stop working in some browsers like ie

6371415
implements	extends
for that i advise you to read the api and see if you can extends some basic providermanager and authenticationprovider instead of implements everything

6371443
implements	extends
the label provider is a custom provider which extends labelprovider and implements itablelayoutprovider

6371459
google-chrome	firefox
sure make the site work in that browser but honestly trying to get it looking the same in ie6 as it does in google-chrome and firefox is going to be a losing battle

6371475

you can use the autoresetevent or the manualresetevent

6371487
jobs	cron
cron jobs do not inherit the login environment of the user

6371487
jobs	cron
the absolute single most common reason cron jobs fail is that the path setting is not what the script writer assumed

6371487
jobs	cron
cron jobs do not have a stdin associated with them

6371518
nsmutablestring	nsstring
stringhtml is of type nsstring and html is of type nsmutablestring

6371606
width	height
check this code.....frame parameters are x y width height

6371615
int	chars
my biggest problem is probably that i don t understand what the binary representation of the various int and string chars .. from js look like and how i convert from data i got from the server to something usable in the program

6371683
google-chrome	firefox
try to view this site in firefox or ie xd and then in google-chrome

6371717
implements	extends
the next thing you want to consider is that if there are multiple entity models that share a property name and you want to share logic regarding that property name utilize the partial aspect of the code-generated classes to extends those classes and have each of them implements an interface

6371727
pull	push
you need to pull this branch before you can push your changes

6371728
filesystems	hfs+
on certain filesystems and i beleive hfs+ too having too many files in the same directory will cause performance issues

6371739

the first output is a double the second an int

6372083
implements	extends
where resultsview searchview extends view and results stringkey implements key

6372089
int	boolean
the boolean flag can be replaced with an information about the level of the account however for that i would use an int 0 meaning trial 1 basic 2 pro etc. over a string tag

6372098
nhibernate	queryover
how would one go in nhibernate to create a query preferably queryover or criteria api for the following

6372101
postgresql	mysql
and perhaps you d find there is no commercial demand for schema-level constraints if mysql can get anyway without check constraints... if postgresql doesn t do it i don t think anyone ever will

6372102
cpu	affinity
i m trying to set the cpu affinity of threads on linux

after searching for the largest and smallest values you can get the width and height as this

6372185
nhibernate	massive
i have noticed that ef is slower than linq2sql massive petapoco ado.net and possibly nhibernate

6372281
hash	salt
yes it s okay to store the per-user salt in the same table which stores the password hash not the password itself - even if the adversary gets access to the raw database data he d still need to try each user s salt+password separately

6372281
hash	salt
to make things clear the user table should only contain the salt and hash of salt+peanuts+password never the password itself

6372306
tiff	png

i figured that if the macro recorder doesn t record mouse events then surely it must record keyboard events but i was wrong about that too

6372455

6372628
sorting	filtering
in the case the server is responsible to sorting paging and filtering of data

6372628
sorting	filtering
if you want use local-side sorting paging and filtering of data you can use loadonce true parameter

6372628
sorting	filtering
in any way the acceptable performance of local sorting and filtering you can receive only for not so large number of rows

6372641
selecteditem	selectedindex
you are almost always better binding to the selecteditem than the selectedindex

6372662
versioning	upgrade
did the versioning numbers increment and dates get later in the upgrade package

6372662
versioning	upgrade
by default a file with no versioning info is considered user data that shouldn t be overwritten during a reinstall or upgrade

6372662
versioning	upgrade
thus upgrade are easiest--and don t require special command-line options--if they are replacing the files with higher versioning numbers or newer dates

6372695
google-chrome	firefox
this works as expected in firefox and google-chrome and even ie

6372695
google-chrome	firefox
this is how i m drawing my svg images and it works fine in google-chrome and firefox

6372818
uninstall	upgrade
major upgrade are not really upgrade as much as uninstall and reinstall of the product in question

6372849
hide	show
you can choose to ignore all of that post s implementation on the javascript side and replace it with your favorite modal plugin but you ll need to bind into the show hide event on the modal dialog to show hide your custom overlay something that should certainly be possible

6372884
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
you can decouple the new and older versioning by using major upgrade because a major upgrade isn t an upgrade but an uninstall of the old versioning and an install of the new versioning in a chained sequence

6372949
hide	show
you can use the same thing to change the show hide text

6372967
portrait	landscape
if the width is 320 then the orientation is portrait if 480 then landscape

6372967
portrait	landscape
then if the orientation has changed since the last check it will fire either a portrait stuff function or a landscape stuff function where you can do your thing for each orientation

6372982
pop-up	dialog
the dialog window pop-up that says verifying requirements and then an error pop-up that says cannot continue this application is improperly formatted and provides details see below

the zend framework quickstart page recommends a pretty small model with only private properties and getter and setter for the specific item

6373121
processors	hyperthreading
my processors is a core i7 950 4 cores 8 threads since it supports intel hyperthreading technology

6373138
box-sizing	border-box
i am wondering if it is a good safe practice to modify the grid system css and add box-sizing border-box to my grid_x classes

6373168
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is useful when you have different sorts of tasks to run which use complementary resources inside the cpu

6373182
button	checkbox
if you can the easiest way would be to just ad a line in button pressed that checks the checkbox

6373241
mdpi	hdpi
images for high dpi displays should be placed in hdpi and similarly mdpi and ldpi

6373241
folder	directory
the default folder for the drawables is drawables if the operating system does not match any dpi category or the resources is not found in special dpi directory the system picks the resource from the drawables directory

6373241
mdpi	hdpi
the size are not exact but upto 130dpi it is considered small from 130 to 180 it can be considered mdpi from 180 to 200 it can be considered as hdpi and the higher is classified as xdpi

6373274
getter	setter
then in the click add save whatever of the second form reference the first form and set it directly or indirectly via a public property getter setter

6373284
move	drag
on attempting to drag and drop a node the text turns to italics without any further info being logged to the console and the move node move back to its original position

6373314
versioning	upgrade
you should keep the vanilla versioning of wordpress on the master so you can upgrade the core and see how it plays with your custom code instead of upgrading the core on something like one of your branches and everything breaking

6373359
mouseleave	mouseenter
the issue is that i can still see the link tags in div id feedsinfo if i just wave over the lists a b c the mouse sits somewhere else now.in short it should fire mouseleave event even though they change color from red to blue and blue to red on mouseenter or mouseleave events

6373404
width	height
i tried to use the following way to get bbox width and height of a group of elements

6373409
screens	tablet
i would go with detecting the screens resolution as it should not really matter if the browser is a phone or tablet the only thing that should affect is the layout

6373428
nsurlcache	nsurlconnection
i found that many topics in web complain that nsurlconnection that use nsurlcache had memory leaks

6373428
nsurlcache	nsurlconnection
in application didfinishlaunchingwithoptions i set instance of nsurlcache with memory capacity 10mb init nsurlrequest with nsurlrequestuseprotocolcachepolicy but i can t recieve connection willcacheresponse message in my nsurlconnection delegate

6373501
stdout	stderr
you can also use the popen3 method if you want to capture stdout and stderr independently

6373533
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
what that means is that if you have a drawable that is say 50x50 on a mdpi screens it will have to be 37x37 on a ldpi screens and 75x75 on a hdpi screens in order to appear at roughly the same physical size on each screens 2cm if you put a ruler on the screens

6373533
screens	mdpi
also your computer screens is most probably mdpi which is why it s recommended to start with mdpi drawables and then resize them the physical size of the drawable will be very close between your computer screens and an mdpi android device

6373533
screens	hdpi
if you view an hdpi drawable on your computer and on an hdpi device you will notice that it s much bigger again physically -- put a ruler on it style on the pc screens

6373533
screens	hdpi
a device could be very small and have an hdpi screens or very large and have an ldpi screens

6373533
screens	mdpi
for example if a drawable fills the whole screens on one mdpi device do not expect it to do the same on another mdpi device

6373533
mdpi	hdpi
for example if a listview can show 5 items on a mdpi device it might be able to show 6 items on an hdpi device in spite of the fact that the listview items have the same density-independent 1.5 times larger on hdpi than on mdpi height

6373546
int	chars
as you can see only int and ascii words are accepted all other chars will cause an error to be added to the list inside the lexer

i read somewhere that if we use windows 7 64bit and developing apps for x86 then a separate gui called nunitx86.exe in the same folder must be used

6381886
avassetwriter	avassetreader
you could use avassetreader and avassetwriter to merge the two files but that s probably further along the control power curve than you need

6381995

things like the footer doesn t stay fixed there s extra padding to the right a div that s supposed to be a 100 width height isn t and so on so forth.

6382276
getter	setter
i googled and had an idea to use or even override lookupgetter and setter where define a new getter setter on the fly but i coundn t find if the interpreter would use this method every time it encounters new key

6382326
post	get
if you are sending over post client side caching shouldn t be the problem if it is a get request check firebug if the cachebuster parameter is being sent along

6382336
hash	md5
if you like you could store the size and the md5 hash which is 16 bytes i think

6382336
hash	md5
the larger your hash md5 is 16 bytes while cr32 is only 4 the less likely that two different files will have the same hash

6382436

there s some detailed articles on the deficiencies of ant and also maven on the site

6382489
public	protected
suppose you make that method access specifier public in base class and make protected in derived class and run the same code

6382495
cpu	processors
...as of right now as far as i am aware it s only viable to target related groups of parallel systems with given paradigms and a gpu embarrassingly parallel is significantly different than a conventional cpu 2-8 threads is significantly different than a 20k processors supercomputer

6382495
cpu	processors
there are actually parallel run-times libraries protocols like charm++ or mpi think actors that can scale -- with specially engineered algorithms to certain problems -- from a single cpu to tens of thousands of processors so the above is a bit of hyperbole

6382501
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
you could create an override for tostring great for when debugging printing to screen etc. as well as equals and gethashcode

6382507

the haxed way copy the project into the folder adobe makes in my user dir or make the theme project compile the swc into the theme folder adobe makes.

6382585

the voip sip libary is not supported by default on android emulator

6382656
rsa	aes
i am encrypting a file with aes using rsa to encrypt the aes password

6382656

the alternative would be the classic scheme when you generate a random password encrypt the file with aes using the random pass encrypt the random pwd with rsa and store only the encrypted results

6382682
hide	show
i tried using lots of combinations of show hide animations on the ui.helper ui.placeholder elements with varying degrees of success

qscrollarea	qgridlayout
the size of qscrollarea is changed inside qgridlayout

6382829
post	get
additionally simply being able to get a link or worse an image tag in will allow the user to make your client and others on the page make any arbitrary get requests including mimicking admin forms if you incorrectly allow both get and post in your inputs - why do you think facebook rewrites all posted links to go through their proxy first

6382844
splist	spsite
the other thing i found is to access with spsite and we have splist sp... etc

6382847
treemap	linkedhashmap
hashmap is generally preferred unless you need some ordering guarantees in which case linkedhashmap or treemap are good choices

6382875
getter	setter
add getter and setter to the method

6382897
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if that still doesn t work then use firebug firefox or the web inspector google-chrome and safari to check if there s a script error and try to see if you can find and fix the error in the script yourself

6382927
put	get
all of the aforementioned map implementations have their basic get put operations in amortized o 1 time complexity

6382944
width	height
note that drawrectangle doesn t accept negative width or height so you must take care of this in the onpaint method

6382953
rss	feed
i m sure it is fine as you can add any website s rss feed to almost any rss reader and it will display its favicon

6382992
post	get
check the official android api or this post to get your started

6382997

6383069
hide	show
what i would like to happen is to hide the tab bar on a certain view and show the tab bar again when the user changes views

6383069
hide	show
it works fine when i show hide it on that view but when i navigate back to the previous view the tab bar there is also hidden

6383069
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear
the same is true when the function is called in the previous view s viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear functions

your width and height are currently out of the objects scope

6383245
jar	war
and to make it worse the controller beans are not located in the war but in a seperate jar

6383245

as this jar is not in the war the jsf annotation processor does not scan it

6383498
post	get
however if you post some code that doesn t work as expected you ll get lots of helpful advice to guide you to the correct solution

6383502
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval in place of settimeout could be used instead if you wanted it to repeat the process for example if things needed to meet a certain specification before the button was to be clicked

6383579
terminate	timeout
you might want to use a time based cache using the session timeout value rather than a straight map as mostly sessions are started but timeout rather than get explicitly terminate by the user

6383579
terminate	timeout
in which case a httpsessionlistener might work for you - although as i mentioned before you probably still need to use a time based cache due to the way that most user sessions timeout rather than terminate

6383680
nant	partcover
i m currently trying to parse a coverage file from partcover using a nant task

6383681
fadein	hide
had to use visiblity hidden instead of display none to be able to detect the position of the element and then do hide remove the visibility styling and animate with fadein

addition	multiplication
the latency is 1 cycle for an integer addition and 3 cycles for an integer multiplication

6384442
multiplying	add
using sse the core i7 can issue simultaneous add and multiplying instructions resulting in a peak rate of 8 floating-point operations flop per clock cycle

6384442
division	multiplication
strange bitshifting code implementing multiplication or division is far less expressive of what you were conceptually trying to achieve so other developers will be confused by that and a confused programmer s more likely to introduce bugs or remove something essential in an effort to restore seeming sanity

6384442
division	multiplication
multiplication and division can be achieved using bit operators.

6384501
serializable	deserialization
in order to use built-in xml serializable and deserialization i have to use multiple instance of xmlarrayitemattribute as described in

mouse	keyboard
here is a how-to how to simulate mouse and keyboard events in code

6384729

6384832
pull	push
our private repos in our home all the others have only read acces so they can pull but we can git push --mirror to it without problems.

6384903
int	boolean
what you can do is have the autogeneratecolumns property set true add the dataset as the datasource for the grid thus getting most of your needed columns then turn autogeneratecolumns off and add the int and boolean columns to the dataset and the grid

6385289
int	double
but for double this is not neccessary the case since 32-bit systems have machine instructions for 64-bit floating point numbers even when thet don t have them for 64-bit int

6385289
int	double
there is two unneccesary conversions first i int is converted to double that s what math.pow takes and then the return value is converted back to 64-bit int long

6385312
int	double
on a 32-bit machine doing addition and comparison on 64-bit int types takes more instructions than doing the equivalent on double s

6385354
accelerometer	gyroscope
apart from gyroscope sensor u can also accelerometer sensor to find orientation but it returns m s 2 in x y z direction

6385376
width	height
i created a user control which is a grid of textblocks with fixed height rows and fixed width each

6385393
wadl	wsdl
wsdl 2.0 and wadl supports description of rest services and the point is similar as with soap services - describe what you can do with the service but in the rest way

mkmapview	mapkit
if you re using a mkmapview from inside a xib you will also need to include the mapkit framework in your project

6385419
codeigniter	yii
2 yii a bit more structured than codeigniter but you have a basic app up within 10 mins and if your familiar with mvc design its a great way to develop portals incredibly quickly

6385419
codeigniter	yii
personally i d say yii might have the edge as it encourages convention more than codeigniter would

why would the button that was used to submit the form be excluded from the form post when remote validation is not called prior to the form submission

6386726
width	margin
if your aim is to get a dynamic margin then you have to adjust with this else go for a fixed width page with centered elements and you don t have to worry about overflow problem

6386727

the best way to implement this is using ascii codes for achieving this you can simply cast each chars to an int you can use the following code

6396165

on my website i put the buttons hide free time and show free time

6396303
onfocus	onblur
alternatively you can hook it up in javascript removing the need for your onfocus onblur attributes in your markup - this script will hook the watermark onto the required inputs events directly

6396303
onfocus	onblur
now you can scrap your onfocus onblur attributes in your markup.

6396303
onfocus	onblur
and you ve got repeatable code meaning you don t have to contaminate your markup with onfocus onblur functionality

6396303
onfocus	onblur
then scrap your onfocus onblur attributes as the watermark function will hook it all up for you

6396303
onfocus	onblur
it also attaches to the onblur onfocus properly

6396303
onfocus	onblur
if you go with solution 2 it s a naive solution - if you want multiple handlers for the onblur and or onfocus then that method doesn t attach properly and all other handlers for those events will be replaced with these - so it s not technically a safe approach though in 99.9 of cases it will work just fine

6396526
ienumerable	iqueryable
i ve only worked matlab and c# the other way around calling matlab from c# but it looks to me like the problem is that you have an iqueryable instance instead of an ienumerable in your code

6396536
width	height
problem is i get this error even though the system.out.println shows the width and height to be 640x480

6396571
submit	submission
i fathomed there might be some funny special characters or something causing this to happen in the copied contents even though there isn t - but if you copy-paste it then delete everything up until the first word biog then submit so you are literally submission one line the same thing still happens

6396571
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my browser latest google-chrome dev on mac os x snow leopard - tried in safari and firefox same problem

6396653
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
beware that it is not supported by some browsers people actually use and on other browsers microsoft s sigh it requires using a special object xdomainrequest rather than the standard xmlhttprequest that jquery uses

6396653
post	get
json-p is only for get though not post again because it works via script tags

6396653
post	get
it will contain the various headers it would send with the get or post as well as the headers origin access-control-request-method get or post and access-control-request-headers the headers it wants to send

6396653
post	get
the browser will look at your response and see whether it s allowed to send you the actual get or post

6396666
inherited	properties
ok you add new properties to the inherited viewmodel then you can bind to them

6396693
bmp	png
if i register my extension via shellex bb2e617c-0920-11d1-9a0b-00c04fc2d6c1 and unregister shimgvw.dll via regsvr32 u shimgvw.dll my thumbnail handler extension works but this creates a problem shimgvw.dll also handles thumbnails for several common image formats like bmp jpg png etc so after unregistering it support for these formats gets disabled

6396700
stateless	stateful
you can also use ejbs stateful or stateless

6396728
folder	directory
another option to create page- or model-specific files you could create directory inside your assets javascripts folder

6396734
filtering	grouping
you cannot do it within the statement itself however you can filtering the rollup set excluding the intermediate rollups where any one but not all rows are being grouping

6396780
hash	salt
the user s password is then re-hashed with a new random salt and the original hash stored in the database is overwritten

6396825
put	get
you might want to put those code in onresume so it always get called when the main activity is brought back from the stack

6396839
super	self
one final point you will often see super childclass self .method where childclass is some arbitrary child class being used instead of a call to the baseclass method explicitly

6396839
super	self
discussion of super is a whole other question but suffice it to say in these cases it s typically being used to do exactly what is being done by calling baseclass.method self

6396855
submit	submission
the problem is the ajax submit is submission the whole page including the html.beginform at in the main view and not performing the asynchronous post with the note

6396876
range	minimum
next you find the scalar range - the minimum and maximum values in your desired output image using the brightness and contrast

6396876
range	minimum
now since we know the brightness and contrast we can setup the lut with the lower value range 0 mapping to minimum and the upper value range 1 mapping to maximum

6396877
persistent	transient
apart from using jpql i can think of one other method - which i dislike immensely i suppose i could have exposed z as an transient property in x as to prevent openjpa from persistent it as a column but that sounds like a really bad idea i am essentially flattening out an object graph manually and introduce unneeded garbage inside the entity bean not counting the time needed to flatten out a complex graph or the error-proness of this it can go awry in so many ways

6396896
hash	salt
from what i hear it is good to use the given password and a random salt and then store the hash password and salt together

6396896
hash	salt
i mean the reason to hash a password is because if someone get into your database they don t have the plain passwords and the salt make it much much harder to reverse the hash to get the password but but if i store the hash with the password what is the point of the salt my knowledge on hashing is every limited so i could be completely off base with my thinking

6396942
salt	md5
generate the salt for every user from some other information md5 of the user-id

6396942
hash	salt
even when the salt is known it will render rainbow table attacks useless or a lot more unlikely so you should always use a salt even when storing the salt right next to the hash linux for example does store the user passwords in the shadow file in a form of id salt hash

6396943
salt	md5
a few security exploits that have occurred this year were because the web application s database contained passwords without a salt and they were done with md5

6396966
opera	google-chrome
it works fine in ie google-chrome and opera

6397200
hash	salt
the only difference i can see here is that the salt hash in the database would change regularly

6397200
hash	salt
but when one of the hash is broken you found a password which together with the salt gives the given hash it most probably is the original password and it will continue to work even if the salt and hash in the database changes later

6397201
post	put
i am not sure if you want to display the cards like you wrote at the beginning of your post - or if you want to put them into an array to do something else

6397270
filtering	grouping
i am looking to create a google charts api dashboard with filtering but i would like to chart the data based on grouping data

6397270
filtering	grouping
in other words the filtering should act on the original datatable but the charts should be based on a grouping datatable

6397270
filtering	grouping
however i cannot seem to bind the filtering to the larger datatable update the grouping table and then draw the charts based on the grouping table

6397280
client-side	server-side
if validation is being performed on the client-side already then i would add any server-side validation in the business layer

np-hard	np-complete
to answer this question you first need to understand which np-hard problems are also np-complete

6397479
hide	show
all i m trying to do is have it slideup down instead of instant hide show

6397484
np-hard	np-complete
to answer the rest of question you first need to understand which np-hard problems are also np-complete

6397484
np-hard	np-complete
if an np-hard problem belongs to set np then it is np-complete

6397526
jar	war
in my experience the only time to place a jar into tomcat s lib folder instead of the war file is when your code references some library by interface and you won t know the underlying implementation until deployment time

6397526
jar	war
in that case i packaged the jms interface jar into the war file and then at deployment time i placed either the activemq or the websphere mq implementation jar into tomcat lib

6397526
jar	war
i thought this was easier than managing multiple war file build variants each bundling a different jms provider jar

6397527
apache	nginx
to add on to this since you also ask about running in apache or other web servers you may want to check out these tutorials about deploying your new sinatra-based application to apache or nginx

note both tutorials cover running sinatra via passenger -- don t be put off by the modrails name which i have had good luck with in deploying apps under apache and nginx

mdpi	hdpi
if your background image is somewhat uniform in texture consider using a single 9-patch image instead of using multiple images for ldpi mdpi hdpi

pop-up	dialog
pressing the app store install button on my ipad 2 pop-up a dialog saying it can t be installed due to the lack of autofocus

6399672
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in google-chrome and in firefox

6399687

g++	gcc
edit i compiled this as just g++ source.cpp -o1 2 3 under cygwin using gcc 4.5.0

6399836

g++	gcc	typedef	typename	typedef	struct
but not with an unnamed struct in which case the code was rejected in g++ 4.2 4.6 with error missing typename in typedef-declaration gcc 4.2 4.6 gave a warning warning unnamed struct union that defines no instances clang++ warning declaration does not declare anything comeau error declaration requires a typedef name

6399910
google-chrome	safari
there s a reason safari has an unblemished record for the last 4 years running as the first browser to fall at pwn2own. google-chrome also has depending on what source you want to believe between 2.5 to 6 times the market share that safari does

6399910
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m not kidding about the security aspect either one security expert i happen to know with a published textbook on how to do security testing has said the only good use for safari is to download firefox or google-chrome

6399956
unsigned	short
without looking at the code do you have a global unsigned short height

6399956

cpu	processors
newer hardware has processors cores shaders inside the video card which differ from your cpu in that they each run much slower but there are many more of them working in parallel

6400085
int	chars
variables of value types most built-in types like int chars bool as well as structs will normally have their memory reclaimed immediately when a function returns since they are allocated on the stack which means they are part of the data structure that gets created when a function begins execution and is freed when the function returns

6400122
restrict	shared
if you re on a shared host usually the host may restrict access to command line

6400136

my horizontal navigation bar is working fine with google-chrome opera mozilla even ie8 but it s not working on ie6

6400261
width	height
i m able to mess with padding width height etc to get the div to look pretty much the same as the input tag it is replacing but i ve got a feeling this is going to be buggy across browsers and would prefer to just use an input that literally does nothing

6400286
portrait	landscape
seems like the keyboard is still in landscape mode even though the phone is in portrait mode

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works quite fine in firefox google-chrome ie but it seems to fail in safari

6400449

6400479
button	checkbox
i want to be able to pass whether or not these checkbox are checked to a service when the submit button is pressed

6400518
for-loop	loops
if you use pre-incrementation for example in a for-loop with ++j then you are basically saying make a copy of the value of j for use in loops then increment j then go through the statements in loops with the copy of j. if you are using post-incrementation in the same loops j++ then you are basically saying make a copy of the value of j for use in loops then go through the statements in loops with the copy of j then increment j.

6400606
int	double
for subtotal it s supposed to be double instead of int but i m not sure how to parse string into a double

6400622

that said you can use aspect oriented programming aop to get a pointcut that captures the execution of visitprogram and in theory you can put your breakpoint in the pointcut

6400623
client-side	server-side
it is not possible because client-side script can not interact directly with server-side script therefore it requires you to have a transporter in the between which is ajax

floating-point	integer
is non-negative integral exponentiation is integer exponentiation and is floating-point exponentiation

6400630
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fractions	integer	fractions
there are three two-argument exponentiation operations raises any number to a nonnegative integer power raises a fractions number to any integer power and takes two floating-point arguments

6400648
base	fractions
also if you want something like 2 1.234 even though your base is an integral 2 your result will obviously be fractions

int	chars
a chars literal has type int

6400777
getter	setter
also check out activesupport delegate to see how you can concisely apply the law of demeter to your rails app and avoid lists of boring getter and setter

6400781
int	chars
the compiler implicitly converts the int to chars

6400781
int	chars
the chars is handled internally by the machine itself most likely for simple types like int

6400789
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 12.0.742.100 too although not as bad as firefox

6400794

int	chars
the value of an int chars constant

6400794
int	chars
numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an int

6400794
int	chars
as you can see since the type of a chars constant is int for sizeof a we get sizeof int which is 4 on your platform

6400794
int	chars
so the int that is a is implicitly converted to a chars

6400794
int	chars
there s an example in there as well showing explicitly that int s can be implicitly converted to chars

action-filter	onactionexecuting
as far as other standard action-filter are concerned deriving from actionfilterattribute all the onactionexecuting onactionexecuting onresultexecuting and onresultexecuted are defined as virtual but their body is empty so it doesn t make any difference if you call or not the base method

6401597
src	attr
you need to use attr src to get the src attribute and then compare it to your roz value

6401600
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
you don t say which java ee app server you intend to use glassfish jboss weblogic etc. i d also recommend looking at the tutorials for your particular vendor

6401605
serializable	deserialization
the rest of the serializable deserialization you will have to do yourself via writing the soap header and body with custom code and skipping your xml reader ahead to your content respectively

6401607
versioning	upgrade
in macos x this is similar to windows only that there s no separation between opengl interface and driver client that s the reason why macos x is so slow to keep up with new opengl versioning it always requires a full operating system upgrade to deliver the new framework

6401640
interpolation	splines
in essence the first time the function is called it should compute a whole bunch of values for a range of x since it will be integrated over anyway and then interpolation that one with splines and cache the coefficients somehow possibly in a file for further use

6401660
haskell	ocaml
in pure functional languages haskell this is not allowed and you have to use monads but most of the impure functional languages f# ocaml allow this

6401716
queue	fifo
i would like to implement some kind of queue or fifo class that keeps all the data

6401754
implements	extends
you can just implements valueof no need to extends number to do it

6401820
superclass	subclassing
but it seems that when a subclassing marks a parameter section implicit it is no longer considered to override the method in the superclass

6401826
hex	binary
-like haskell binary compiled with ghc in a hex editor

6401833
inline	inlining
code can be inline within packages however inlining never occurs across

6401844
getter	setter
it s not how you re supposed to use dot notation and you should never do something very complicated in your getter and setter and they should never do anything to your object except lazily initializing it but there are no hard barriers in place to prevent you from doing this kind of stuff

6401844
getter	setter
it s up to the implementor of getter and setter methods which are the only methods supposed to be called via dot notation to ensure this kind of frivolity does not happen but there s nothing stopping the caller of a method to call destrucitve methods that weren t intended to be used that way via dot notation

6401850
treeview	checkboxlist
i have a checkboxlist in asp.net which i d like to convert to a treeview using something like jstree

6401854
qsort	memcmp
sort it in lexicographical order so your comparator for qsort just calls memcmp left right 17

6401907
glfw	glew
i recomment glfw for window context creation it deals with all that proxy context stuff too and glee or glew to make the opengl extensions available to the code

6401925
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
anyways making a uinavigationcontroller with a uitabbarcontroller used to be straight forward for me using the interface builder now i cant find the correct attributes

6401986
width	height
i am trying to create background images with rounded corners and rough edges of variable width and height for several divs of different width height

6401986
width	height
these sections would correspond to the size of the corners and would each have a background url of the image of the corners 3 rotated or would be of varying width or height for the side sections 20px by whatever

6401986
width	height
if the width height of these divs is longer than 200px then the background image would be repeated

6401995
minimum	max	range	max	range	minimum
i ve also seen the solution that is to get sql to get a random row between a minimum maximum range like so floor max needed_id rand but this would only work when the rows are sequential 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

6402014
ant	jdk6
build the copied project using jdk6 by invoking ant thus getting a jdk6-compliant jar

when deploying web applications before i ve used vbscript and powershell plus good old fashioned xcopy though i d agree robocopy is probably a better copy replacement

6402087
ssl	https
now when i m trying to access this service online get an error to create endpoint but i can t figure our how to create endpoint especially when wcf address is ssl https enabled website

6402108
inherited	subclassing
i could have subclassing the zend_controller_action into some base controller with all the shared code which all other controllers can inherited from but as far as i know it s not the best practice to do

6402112
ceil	floor
you do not need to run integers through floating-point ceil and floor methods

6402136
width	height
1 re-size images to a maximum width and height on client size

6402166
noexcept	decltype
new keywords alignas alignof char16_t char32_t constexpr decltype noexcept nullptr static_assert and thread_local

6402166
integer	unsigned
certain integer literals larger than can be represented by long could change from an unsigned integer type to signed long long

6402166
int	double
for example the following code is valid in c++ 2003 but invalid in this international standard because double to int is a narrowing conversion

6402175
background-color	transparency
if you need to get it working on multiple different background colors requiring you to have transparency inside and outside of the border-image then you can create an element behind the current element which is within the borders and assign the background-color there

i ve implements the guestbook example from the reference guide and am now trying to extends it with edit functionality

6402213
jobs	cron
i tried using windows scheduler but i think it only works for windows server and cron jobs works only for linux

6402253
post	put
it works but i can t use it with swfupload since it uses the http post verb and not the http put verb that the azure blob storage expects when creating a new blob item

6402253
post	put
for those interested in the client code that wont work since swfupload uses http post and not put as azure blob storage expects

6402253
put	get	post	get	post	put
i figured since swfupload is open source that i download the source and change the verb from post to put sadly the flash player urlrequestmethod does not support other verbs than get and post

6402253
put	get
i ve read that silverlight 3 and later supports the http put verb so i think i have to write some silverlight code to get my way here

6402253
put	get
since silverlight supports both the http put verb that azure blob storage requires and supports progressive uploads i now have the possibility to upload massive files directly to the azure blob storage and i don t have to go throgh a asp.net solution i also get some nice progress bars and the user can cancel in the middle of the upload if he she wants to

6402254
superclass	subclassing
because there is nothing to override you re implements an interface not subclassing from a superclass which already has definition for that method

6402261
width	height
so if it sticks to left or right side of a screen - it should have maximal height and fixed width

6402261
width	height
if it sticks to top or bottom side - it should have a fixed height and maximized width 100 of a screen width

6402261

google-chrome	firefox
extremely slow i think the google-chrome firefox remote drivers are faster than it

6402291

i saw the railscast at which describes how to use capybara with rspec on a rails application

6402314

considered alfresco openkm and knowledgetree

6402329
post	get
get and post parameters are in the http header not the html source

6402329
post	get
however any get or post parameters would have been sent by your net http code so you can print those out yourself

6402358
macports	homebrew
you could also switch from macports to homebrew then all your open-source software lives under usr local and you don t get into this sort of problem

6402360
google-chrome	firefox
this works well in ie 9 but not in google-chrome nor in firefox - both just empty the bar div

6402360
google-chrome	firefox
when debugging in browser it seems resulthtml is empty in both google-chrome and firefox but in ie it s correct

6402388
versioning	upgrade
try contacting your shard hosting provider and ask them to upgrade to the latest php 5.3 versioning

when a user connects to a https url for example using a web browser safari google-chrome ... then the user can get information about the certificate related to a such https url

6402458
width	height
also considering your response in some of the comments - the hidden selector will only find elements that are display none or a width and height of 0 and input hidden but that doesn t apply to ul li .

6402462
vb.net	vb6
realize the differences between vb.net and vb6 and prepare to learn some more object-oriented programming

6402483
fadein	hide
from the comments it seems like this is just a misunderstanding fadein won t have an effect on an already 100 visible element you need to hide the element first something like this

6402538
elf	coff
you can use a custom makefile setup.hs hook and invoke windres if you re on windows or objcopy elfrc if you re on linux to compile resources to coff elf objects which you can then combine with your haskell object files to form the final executable

6402604
cos	sin
therefore sin kal and cos kal are not necessarily equal to 1 or 0 respectively

6402604
cos	sin
to get better precision from sin and cos i suggest the following

6402604
cos	sin
second invoke sinl and cosl instead of sin and cos

6402612
uicontrol	uibutton
uibutton is a subclass of uicontrol which is a subclass of uiview

6402612
inherited	properties
uiview has the tag properties so uibutton inherited this properties

6402623
google-chrome	firefox
a quick demo google-chrome firefox

6402769
config	ini
use the configparser class to read config files in the ini file format

6402770
mpfr	mpc
the standard choice of library for c is gmp which has all of those features but if you have specific correctness requirements for floats you may need the additional mpfr library and finally there is also mpc to do the same for complex numbers

6402777
querypath	phpquery
but if you want to actually fetch content from real-world html then it s easier to use a dom parser like phpquery or querypath for simplicity

6402810
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it renders correctly on firefox safari and google-chrome however on ipad and iphone somehow the rightmost link at the menu is broken

codeigniter	cakephp
i have installed both cakephp and codeigniter and it seems that codeigniter is much smaller a little less overwhelming and documentation is clearer

6403035
codeigniter	cakephp
why do people say cakephp is somewhat harder than codeigniter for people new to mvc

6403069
cpu	processors
i think because the android device has a different processors architecture than your pc so the cpu on your pc needs to emulate the android so it would do much more processing

6403084
post	get
also note that while technically not forbidden an entity body on a get is not standard and there are many products that do not handle it properly so you d wind up abusing post or another method to accomplish this

6403090

i ve followed this gist this blog post and downloaded and deployed this example and in all 3 cases i get

6403286
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i used the viewwillappear method because viewdidload seems to only be called once

6403292
boost	stl
the standard thing to do would be to use the hash classes provided by boost stl and many other popular libraries

6403295
groupbox	panel
ie a panel tabsheet groupbox or some other container

6403309

using put as the action method of the form does not work but get seems to be ugly

6403447
subtraction	addition
is there any neat way to check is it is possible to do datetime operations addition subtraction etc

6403475
profiling	instrumentation
you can play around with xcode instrumentation using build profiling in xcode 4 - specifically the zombies one which keeps dead objects around as zombies but let s you know when they get accessed

6403479
rss	feed
i am displaying data from an rss feed including the date

6403484
put	get	post	get	post	put
you should never ever put get post variables directly into a database query

6403505
min	max
unless you are doing some serious date-crunching i don t know of any instance where i would be bumping into the min and max values

6403519
width	height
the width of the image is size.width and the height is size.height

6403519
cgpoint	cgrect
if that doesn t work my advice is to create cgpoint cgrect etc for every intermediate value to make all of your calculations explicit

6403560
width	height
or you can compare other things like width height etc

6403598
put	get	post	get	post	put
i have added a custom action filter in my mvc app which checks for option requests and responds with an allow header specifying get post put delete although it never seems to do a follow up post request.

6403598
google-chrome	firefox
the request tried this in firefox google-chrome

6403607
for-loop	loops
i am searching for a way to loops through a list of items in a for-loop fashion except i want loops to iterate in a random way

6403619
mdpi	hdpi
my first android app that i wrote was designed so it supported the three commonly used resolutions 240x320 ldpi 320x480 mdpi and 480x800 hdpi

6403619
mdpi	hdpi
besides the parameters i ve also created drawables for ldpi mdpi and hdpi

6403714
hash	md5
this would pick the first two character from an md5 hash 00 - ff 256 subdirectories to generate the subdirectory

6403725
xlib	xcb
this is one among the reasons why xcb was created in the first place fix the problems of xlib

6403725
xlib	xcb
however there is a xlib wrapping around xcb and one can safely use that to interface with glx and still use xcb for the rest of the program

6403738
awt	swing
i am using swing and awt for the listeners to make a small program

6403746
gmail	hotmail
but for some reason mail doesn t send the emails or my 3 different email accounts hotmail gmail yahoo don t receive them and therefore don t even put them in the spam folder

6403747
accessor	properties
if you re making the connections in code you need to add properties or other suitable accessor methods so that the code in one class can get at the necessary object instances in the other

6403787
post	get
you do not need to pass variables in a get or post like way when including or requiring files the variables are shared between the files as long as the values are set before the including happens

6403792
post	get
this value is always set when handling an http request and will be get post head etc.

6403817
128bit	64bit
originally both were really just 64bit execution units and 128bit operations were broken down into 2 micro-ops

6403863

put doesn t work because of restful routes - the post version would activate the meetings route will call create for a new meeting put is simply denied by the router as not existing

6403884
scheme	racket	lisp	racket	lisp	scheme
racket is actually unique among lisp and scheme in this kind of support but even with others the situation is still far more advanced than in non-lisp languages

6403890

furthermore i would recommend to remove the parent and put the information into the reactor cause you would get trouble during site generation phase

6403891
versioning	upgrade
slf4j upgrade your binding to versioning

6403966
nswindow	nspanel
most methods listed in the nswindow class reference also work on nspanel because nspanel inherits from nswindow

6403996
move	drag
when i drag the scrollmenu with the finger and i stop my finger held down the cclayer in background is not updated anymore and the sprites does not move

6404080
post	get
in this case the users will have to use easyxdm or create their own proxy -- by proxy here i mean users will have to write some code on their backend that can communicate with your api such that a post request will go directly to your server and a get response will get from their own proxy

6404094
strtol	atoi
strtol can be a better atoi specifically w.r.t

6404108

firefox sends a keypress for backspace google-chrome doesn t

6404475
gif	png
base64 followed by the base-64 encoded file replacing png with whatever is appropriate gif jpeg

6404475
folder	directory
the better way is to actually drop the file into a tmp folder echo a link to that file and then delete all files in that directory that are older than x minutes

6404476
width	height
i will be grabbing the width of the parent div with jquery but i need to work out the math to automatically work out the height size

6404476
width	height
youtube has managed to do this in their custom sizer click share then embed and fill in the width to see the height automatically fill in

6404480
youtube	vimeo
this works but when i try clicking a video like youtube or vimeo from within the web view it opens on top of the view controller

6404489
width	height
get original width height ratio

6404489
width	height
so you will keep same ratio on new width height combination

6404507
rss	feed
i ve coded up an rss feed for my site using basic php

postgresql	mysql
the table is also postgresql while the main queries are mysql

6416637
ienumerable	iqueryable
for the last you can have combined approach where you have methods returning ienumerable for most common scenarios queries used more often and one method exposing iqueryable for rare or complex dynamically build queries

6416637
ienumerable	iqueryable
when you expose iqueryable you must keep your context alive until you execute the query - iqueryable uses deferred execution in the same way as ienumerable so unless you call tolist first or other functions executing your query you still need your context alive

6416788
equals	toarray
as soon as you call contains containsall equals hashcode remove retainall size or toarray you d have to traverse the elements anyway

if you don t dispose it meaning it s disposed when a application exits it is no problem to return ienumerable iqueryable no having actual data

6416862
implements	extends
it s ok to change how it is implements in general as long as you don t have to change it whenever you want to extends derive from the class

6416868

vim	notepad++
i have been told from recent posting that regex is the way to go but i m unfamiliar with it and do not know what to use notepad++ vim word or anything else

6416891
implements	sealed	implements	extends
since they are sealed i cannot extends them to say provide extra functionality that doesn t belong in the server or implements an interface

6416891
implements	extends
i can however extends the functionality of these classes by implements the defined partial methods and adding extra properties to the other partial class

the width and height of the source image are filled in correctly in the pixel bender toolkit but when i run this shader as a filter in flash player 10 the srcsize value is not automatically filled in

6417161
hash	salt
the most elegant way is of course to encapsulate the hash and salt in a class and return an instance of this class

6417170
hash	salt
a straightforward way of doing this is a small struct that contains the hash and the salt in the struct

6417178
hash	salt
you would have to create an object that had the hash byte and salt byte as two instance variables

6417195
hash	salt
if you re using project lombok you can use the data annotation to create a value class that encapsulates hash + salt and the lombok-ifier will automatically generate the boilerplate code

6417206

if you remove width and height from the canvas that seems to shift the content

6417392
iboutlet	ibaction
the best practice for a uiview is to communicate with the viewcontroller using targets that can be defined from the viewcontroller by using ibaction for methods and iboutlet for variables

6417392
iboutlet	ibaction
whenever the user makes any event with the view it can alert the controller through these ibaction and the controller can talk to the view using the iboutlet

6417494
profiling	debugging	profiling	benchmarking
then you may benchmarking profiling and debugging the sweet jesus out of that code

6417512

as an example if you have comboa and combob and combob is set in response to the selection in comboa then setting the selectedindex of combob from the view is fine but setting the items or the selecteditem of combob is not - those properties are both data related and should be specified via binding to the viewmodel

qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
i can get around this by having the derived items cast the qgraphicsitem returned by qgraphicsscene itemat using dynamic_cast but i don t really understand why that works and not qobject_cast or the benefits or disadvantages to using dynamic_cast vs

ant	maven
i would suggest that you look into using the ivy dependency manager usually used with the ant build tool or the maven build tool which has an inbuilt dependency manager

6434929
versioning	upgrade
but don t dismantle or upgrade the old usr bin versioning

6434934
width	margin	width	height	margin	height

google-chrome	firefox
so this code works fine in firefox and google-chrome but doesn t in ie

6435074
unsigned	short
cast it to unsigned assuming you ve got the usual convention of 0 darkest 255 brightest then cast it to signed short i assume that s what you want since plain short is by default signed

children	parent
i need it to be ordered primarily by its id but if its parent_id does not equal its id it is placed after its parent and also these children would ordered by id

6435131
int	chars
1 i am perfectly aware of c++ unsigned chars ranges and i can t change them to int

6435414
postgresql	mysql
even with activerecord sitting as an abstraction layer between you and your database there will be differences between mysql and sqlite and postgresql and some of them will be subtle and the correct time for them to bite you is in the development and test environments not production

6435438
postgresql	mysql
mysql and sqlite are pretty loose with their type conversions postgresql is strict

6435438
postgresql	mysql

google-chrome	firefox
now this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but generate an error in ie

6436088
min	max
although it does not give you min and max x in single query following code may be useful to you

6436125
firefox	safari

6436145
hide	show
one way is hide the button from javascript and show some ajax loader image

yes you can use the same port number for both tcp and udp

6437427
udp	tcp
many protocols already do this for example dns works on udp 53 and tcp 53

6437427
udp	tcp
technically the port pools for each protocol are completely independent but for higher level protocols that can use either tcp or udp it s convention that they default to the same port number

6437427
udp	tcp
when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept

6440454
button	checkbox	post	get

jar	war
you may have to compile them on your own create your own jar file that has compiled classes and include the jar file in the war file manually this would be a good test at least

i have implemented the pop-up by using activity with theme dialog

6440810

6440925
folder	directory
it s already added and committed so each directory has its own .svn folder already

6440925
folder	directory
i can t just copy-paste the entire directory over from the gui program s location because then all the .svn folder would be over-written

6440925
folder	directory
the lazy approach is to go into each folder side-by-side and manually just copy over the files for the base directory and every sub-directory therein

6440981
folder	directory
inside your war directory you should have a folder named after your module

6440983

i need to get the closest class html from my list but its always returning null if i put directly the closest

6441030

width	height
your js fiddle example works fine if you use height width but not for positioning it seems

6442481
move	drag
on the other hand the drag event of the draggable is raised every time the mouse move and seems appropriate for the task

6442481
draggable	droppable
drag is raised whether or not the draggable actually lies over a droppable

6442481
draggable	droppable
one way to solve both problems is to associate the droppable and the draggable in the over handler using jquery s data facility and disassociate them in the out and drop handlers

6442481
draggable	droppable
now that the draggable knows the droppable it s lying over we can update the element s appearance in a drag event handler

6442667
google-chrome	firefox
this way you can restrict the use of programs to browsers you want if you can t lock down google-chrome and firefox and on a reboot it will clear any changes to the pc basically returning you to a clean state status

6442728
folder	directory
i don t know why you d need to change the folder to applications but your strategy of creating sub web.config files in each child directory is one correct way of achieving this

6442731
post	get
unless you post some code you just get wild guessing here s mine you didn t properly override the method but hide it with a method of the same name and signature

6442754

6443025
textview	imageview
i ve done a custom arrayadapter that contains two views an imageview and a textview

6443025

6443051
postgresql	greenplum
greenplum is a massively parallel processing database based on postgresql and is designed for analytic data warehouses to manage store and analyze terabytes to petabytes of data

6443061
sysv	systemd
of course you could use nasty slow techniques where every lock and unlock operation require a syscall to emulate robust mutexes on a systemd without proper futex-like robust mutex support using fcntl locking or sysv semaphores both of which have semantics by which automatic and atomic unlocking owner registration could be achieved.

6443066
width	height
you should place the loading animation html in the actual document and use css to make it cover and hide the page positioned absolutely with 100 width and height and a background

6443071
google-chrome	firefox
.html in jquery is an equivalent of innerhtml which means that in normal browsers e.g firefox google-chrome it should get it right while in ie you ll have to use the outerhtml property

6443100
folder	directory
if no solution .sln and or project .csproj file is present then the chances are this is a standard file-system type web site where once loaded only cares about anything and everything under its own root directory as opposed to a web application that does have these files where file and folder paths and more are persisted.

6443114
tablet	galaxy
btw this happens on the samsung galaxy s1 s2 and the acer android tablet so its not just the device

6443118

6443227
google-chrome	firefox
best works in google-chrome and firefox

6443250

something that could work and applies both to int and double numbers could be like

6443271
getter	setter
yes you can define a getter setter for properties and a shadow function for the function like this

6443283
put	get	post	get	post	put
you ll note we set the content_type header only on a post or put but the general method of adding headers via a request interceptor is used for get as well

6443294
post	get
since this is a get and not a post request it makes an empty uploadimageform and renders it inside upload_template.html

6443330
portrait	landscape
when the phone is oriented in portrait i want m-f 5 columns and when in landscape su-sa 7 columns

6443338
for-loop	arrays
i then tried to use a regular arrays but then a found the length property of an arrays in js doesn t carry over so i couldn t preform a for-loop through all the items because there wasn t anyway of knowing how many elements there were

6443431
ssms	sqlcmd
the easiest way i ve found for executing a large scripts outside ssms from a tool is to use the sqlcmd

6443432
spannable	spanned
you need to use a spannable see is there any example about spanned and spannable text for an example

6443450
cells	tablecell
imagine you have two cells one left pointed and another one right pointed you have to subclass the tablecell

6443455
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and google-chrome but fails in ie8 no errors in ie8 the table just doesn t show up

6443485
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	libxml2
the html is malformed but i ve seen this error in multiple sites and since the browser is able to display it correctly i m hoping scrapy or the underlying lxml libxml2 beautifulsoup should also parse it correctly

6443517
wan	lan
users on the lan will be treated as remote just like users from the wan will

6443522
put	get
one example could be to use the different language wikipedias - download enough data in each language generate a list of the characters used in the documents with counts and put in a threshold to get rid of small instances of borrowed text from other languages

6443541
int	chars
promotes the result to an unsigned int but in the second example you force it back into an unsigned chars where it overflows back to 0

6443542
inherited	properties
actually i think you simply need to define the class actionlink in css so that it doesn t inherited the properties of the td that s containing it

6443564
union	distinct
sql server will union the results together which is an implied select distinct and then order the results by col1 then col2

6443568
int	chars
in the second program your int is assigned to an unsigned chars which results in truncation of 0x100 to 0x00

6443590
mouseover	mouseout
i m working on a menu which animates each li s padding and color properties on mouseover and mouseout and i wanted to stop the animations and color changes by changing the link s class

6443590
mouseover	mouseout
edit - since the code you all have provided below should work but does not i ve gone ahead and put in the code for the mouseover mouseout animations to see if for some strange reason there would be a conflict

6443599
filesystems	hfs+
basically you can use libdmg to unpack a dmg file to an uncompressed file containing a hfs+ filesystems play around with the files inside the hfs+ filesystems and them put it back together again as a dmg file with the correct checksums

6443629

6443663
uicontrol	uibutton
the big deal with uibutton is that it inherits from uicontrol and a good and simple explanation is on the uicontrol class reference itself

6443663
uiview	subviews
the uiview programming guide view and window architecture - tips for using views effectively - do not customize controls by embedding subviews

6443664

6443693
google-chrome	firefox
fails in firefox 5.0 google-chrome 13.0.782 but works in ie9

6443736
persistent	transient
when you use .saveorupdate hibernate will check if the object is transient it has no identifier property and if so it will make it persistent by generating it the identifier and assigning it to session

6443741
instances	transient
as stated here saveorupdate either saves a transient instances by generating a new identifier or updates reattaches the detached instances associated with its current identifier

6443761
ant	maven
in our existing structure this is in a build structure in the folder system referenced by a command-line build an amalgam of ant maven 1 and maven 2

6443798
width	height
drawtext will then modify your rectangle to the new height and width if necessary

6443818
google-chrome	firefox
i have noticed that css3 performance is unusably worse than javascript when doing a variety of css3 transitions including height or opacity transitions animations in firefox 5+ and google-chrome even the latest specifically on platforms that have nvidia optimus and or intel gma igp graphics - including the latest intel hd 3000

6443818
google-chrome	firefox
i have observed that firefox in particular defaults to using the integrated intel graphics hd 3000 in this case on optimus systems - even when a significantly more powerful nvidia gpu is present and google-chrome seems to be hit-or-miss

6443818
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried forcing firefox and google-chrome to use nvidia in the nvidia control panel but even then it won t take

6443818
google-chrome	firefox
even ios outperforms google-chrome and firefox in css3 transitions

6443825
width	height
you just need to remember to only call the runnable from onsizechanged if the new width and height are greater than 0 and if they are not equal to the old width and height

6443825
move	drag
then i just tracked the taps and drag relative to the extents of the options and move the selector on a timed handler a la animations in javascript

put	get
my answer isn t really helpful but you d need to put in slightly more effort yourself in order to get decent help

6444015
for-loop	loops
your for-loop isn t getting the child folders because you forgot to implement the recursion which exists in the foreach loops

6444115
width	height
i am given a rectangle of some height and width i want to fill this rectangle with some dummy single line text

6444115
width	height
the height and width of text should be close to that of given rectangle

6444115
width	height
eg if rectangle height and width is 100 and 300 respectively then the single line text height and width should be close to 100 and 300 respectively

6444498
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
javascript in google-chrome firefox safari should be the same on osx and windows provided you are using equivalent versions between osx and windows

you should use mapping tables when you are trying to model a many-to-many or one-to-many relationship

6453785
folder	directory
tomcat takes the default directory as lib......so if you want to hmake your own folder inside the lib then u probably need to redefine the the path....

6453827
hash	md5
of course in practice you probably wouldn t want to use a whole 32 char md5 hash just say the first 6 characters and applying cleansing such as changing s to 5 etc

6453859
spaces	delimiter
delimiter spaces one or more

6453872
strdup	malloc
the proper way of handling this is to keep track of what has been dynamically allocated through malloc or strdup

cvs	svn
say i want to convert a .cvsignore file to an svn ignore property while converting an old cvs project to svn

its working fine in firefox google-chrome safari and ie9+ but not in ie7 and ie8

6454314
width	height
just checking the width and height of the image is not sufficient to know the orientation and this is causing your stretching that you are seeing

6454321
put	get
you can just put something in etc hosts on the local system for testing but eventually you ll have to get a real hostname for other people to access your site application

6454322
for-loop	loops
change your while loops to a for-loop like so

6454363

if you need to decode your code you must use a 2 way algorithm such as aes or des

6454500
inline	inlining	inline	one-definition-rule	one-definition-rule	inlining
the main purpose of the inline keyword today is not so much to enable the inlining optimization which the compiler applies pretty aggressively whether or not you tell it to but instead to suppress the one-definition-rule odr so that a function can be fully defined in a header without risking multiple definitions errors from the linker

6454507
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
afaik most of the time dpi and ppi are the same and it next generalized to hdpi mdpi ldpi see android screens ranges

profiling	debugging
i d advise against profiling a debugging version though if you can avoid it as the vs compiler works very differently between debugging and release and you may get erroneous results...

6454523
sorting	grouping
this is my previous question for sorting grouping within project tree

6454523
sorting	grouping
here i am asking for sorting grouping files frameworks within project-tree

6454533
width	height
it makes it easier to determine the width and or height of the new image

6454578
implements	extends
the collections frameworks is an example of that - it has arraylist extends abstractlist implements list

6454601
implements	extends
on the flip side interfaces allow the flexibility for a class to implements multiple interfaces whereas a class can only extends one other class

6454727
versioning	upgrade
first i would upgrade to the beta versioning second i think you re using a older versioning of jquery

the functionality that requires windows azure roleentrypoint or other windows azure specific functionality should be tucked behind an interface that is injected autofac unity castle-windsor ninject mef etc.

6454852
hash	hmac
it is true that for the client there is no need to generate an hmac hash signature on each call but the server side must still authenticate the token and the session concept fouls up the clean restful stateless behavior

6454861
filtering	grouping
the having clause is the key part - it s necessary to filtering the results after the grouping by clause since a where clause filtering out rows before they re grouping

6454929
min	max
d i j min for t 1 to i max d i - t j - 1 sum s i - t + 1 ...s i for i 1 to n and j 2 to k

6454929
min	max
now let s consider there are i elements in the sequence and number of intervals is j we can assume that last interval is s i - t + 1 ...s i where t is positive integer not greater than i so in that case solution is max d i - t j - 1 sum s i - t + 1 ...s i but as we want the solution be minimal we should chose t such to minimize it so we will get min for t 1 to i max d i - t j - 1 sum s i - t + 1 ...s i

6454931
margin	height
the total height of every list item is height + padding + border + margin

6454954
hide	show
some of you may have noticed this just isnt working as its meant to show the clicked element and hide the other show ones any help would be appreciated

6455074
octal	decimal
javascript treats all whole numbers that start with a zero as octal so the actual value of 013 is indeed 11 decimal

6455074
octal	decimal
there s an exception for whole numbers containing the digits 8 or 9 - since those aren t legal in octal the parser will implicitly treat them as decimal even in the presence of a leading zero

6455092
config	ini
people may specify that you can manage errors within your php application but by personal preference i think this is the wrong way to go about it configuring the ini and config files for your web-server and mysql mssql will result in more acute management

6455096
octal	decimal
an octal number is no different from a decimal number once it s been interpreted as a number

6455169
hash	md5
also you can always use a hash algorithm md5 sha1 etc. to create a key

6455190
for-loop	loops
you can do foreach loops to achieve much the same thing as a typical for-loop

6455207
children	parent
any particular folder has one parent and multiple children

6455213
for-loop	arrays
the resulting arrays can be traversed via a for-loop and gives you the associative key

6455220
factories	presenter
when the presenter creates or deals with views it uses an abstract factories and only knows about the view interfaces

6455256
overwrite	preserve
seems that if the file already existed and didn t contain bom then it won t contain bom when overwrite in other words streamwriter preserve bom or it s absence when overwriting a file

6455287
accessor	properties
statements 1-3 are all okay but you generally want to access ivars directly in init and dealloc methods and use the properties accessor everywhere else

6455383
backslash	double-quotes
to have a string value inside your json array you must remember to backslash escape your double-quotes in your java program

6455393
accessor	properties
however elapsed events are continued to be raised when autoreset is set to false and the enabled accessor appears to be doing it s job in preventing the enabled properties of the base class from being modified once the paused variable is set

uitableview	nsindexpath
if you need a nsindexpath for a uitableview you can use indexpathforrow insection reference

6455496
implements	extends
if you want to implements the same semantics as extends you have to use dojo.mixin instead of dojo.extend which extends prototypes

6455577
visualvm	oql	visualvm	jhat	oql	jhat
the oql implementation in visualvm is based on the one you can find in jhat and it means that it is javascript based - in addition to standard oql queries it allows you to use plain javascript thus increasing the flexibility many times

6455588
put	get
you need to create a click listener for the button and in that create the intent and put a string extra which you get from the valuetv text

6455650
slideup	slidedown
now if i move the mouse out of the menu and bring it back in before it slides up menu has a lot of items so there is enough time to bring the mouse back in on the menu over the dropdown menu it starts a chain of slidedown and slideup functions and it does not stop till i move the mouse of the menu or back on the button

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is only happening in firefox everything works fine in ie7 ie8 safari google-chrome not sure about other versions of firefox

children	parent
this means that any changes to object state made by the children aren t automatically visible to the parent

6455729
pull	push
but windows users a don t grok ssh and b don t know linux command line environments and want a way either with their ide version control plugins or gui tools or with a cgi page written by me in python to remotely pull a clone giving them effectively a way to push or publish their hg repository up to a central repository without recourse to any ssh access to the remote server system

6455732
post	get
just use regular http get and post

6455754
inherited	properties
the reason why i like this approach is because i inherited from the mydialogviewmodel and provide more properties so that for instance i can display a bunch of options for the user to choose from

6455781
width	height
then you only need to assign the same background image as the others same width and height of the others display block and just change the background position of the image

6455815
put	get
you will need a button listener for your submit button and in its onclick method you will need to put the value in the bundle which can get passed to the next intent

6455837
svg	vml
not to be a pain and sidestep you but - and i say this as a canvas lover - the best charting package i ve used is graphael which uses svg vml and not canvas

6455862
implements	extends
pros simple to implements -- just type extends eventdispatcher and you are done

6455922
setinterval	clearinterval
it is true that setinterval is global but each call to setinterval returns a unique id that you can use to reference it for clearinterval

6456087
google-chrome	firefox
it works in the newest versions of google-chrome and firefox 4 but ie9 doesn t have this implemented yet and there s no word on if ie10 will have it either

6456122
public	protected
also since the static initializer will most likely initialize some static fields if these fields are public protected or package-private depending on your javadoc visibility convention you shold add details about the way these fields are initialized based on the behavior of the static initializer

6456133
google-chrome	firefox
this is only an issue for ie tested in ie8 google-chrome and firefox behaves as expected

6456151
put	get
use getgnuwin32 to get all the tools necessary to build the library put them in your path then rerun pip

6456161
post	get
if your not sure how to do this let me know and i ll post some code for you which will get the directions from google and extract the data you need

6456169
hide	show
you can then have a div with this message in it and show or hide it based on this value

6456187
onchange	onkeyup
in addtion onchange occurs when the field loses focus while onkeyup is fired as the user types

6456235

directcast controls lbl i.tostring label is giving out a null value or nothing

6456333
put	get
however if i put doxygen comments in my header files i can t get eclipse to display those comments when i hover the mouse pointer over an instance of the commented method member

6456335
google-chrome	firefox
working fine in google-chrome 12 firefox 5 and ie 9 even with delete cut and paste actions performed in the textareas

6456352
post	get
a get is limited in size for the browser while a post is not

6456452
post	get
however imho i would probably change the xhr from get to post simply to prevent problems with sending long data

6456473
hide	show
for example i have a user control let s call it mycontrol1 and i want to create show and hide javascript functions that can be called from javascript on the parent page - something like mycontrol1.show

6456506
getter	setter
you could create an object with a cookie setter and getter

6456506
getter	setter
more about getter and setter

6456564
gtk	gdk
i m programming in python gdk without gtk simply as a x11 abstraction

6456574
getter	setter
maybe you can let the controls be public or use friend methods to save the getter setter writing

6456590
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade the app by running the msi file which will have a higher versioning number than the installed versioning

6456605
nsurl	nsstring
having trouble getting nsstring to convert to nsurl item.image holds the url for an image that im getting through xml

6456621
processors	hyperthreading
if you are talking about a processors with hyperthreading then that processors has extra execution pipelines for most parts of the execution cycle

6456621
processors	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading
a quick test to validate this is to use a computer with hyperthreading spawn off some threads that do processors heavy operations and look at the cpu usage

6456634
post	put
put the asyncfileupload control in an iframe on the page which will post back to just that section

6456695
getter	setter
this viewdata class is a class of getter and setter

6456737
google-chrome	safari
what we found out is that safari and maybe some older versions of google-chrome or other webkit browsers have a problem with facebook s code using the innerhtml js function if your page arrives with an xhtml response header application xhtml+xml

6456740
hide	show
would i need to create another panel inside the container panel for each item they have selected and then hide show based on the active item show as item #1 in the dropdown

6456767
folder	directory
when i try to upload a file to the directory i get the expected login screeen but my login doesn t work and after several tries the page errors out with access to path server path fubar drop folder name filename.txt is denied

6456782
webkit	gecko
for example the bit like gecko is deliberately used to coax servers into sending the same markup as it would for firefox unless the server knows specifically about webkit

6456798
rss	feed
php-created rss feed

6456798
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome show the source code instead of the nice feed view other feeds are shown correctly

6456824
subtract	add
although you will have to add or subtract the length of your string test or abc

6456834
superclass	subclassing
if your xml filename is stored as a static member of your superclass have your subclassing assign the value before generatetestdata is called

6456872
cos	sin
to make things quicker you could calculate cos t and sin t directly

6456907
portrait	landscape
if the phone is in portrait mode and a user starts my app i see my app background appear then it will do an orientation rotation to landscape view because i use setrequestedorientation within my app

6456907
portrait	landscape
i just want a hard switch between portrait and landscape

6456912
ubuntu	linux
the problem seems to be either in eventmachine bundled with latest thin in ruby 1.9.2-r290 or in the linux kernel ubuntu 10.4 lts 2.6.38.3-linode32

6456926
getter	setter
there are certain situations where you might want a view model to combine data from multiple models sources or for specific validation scenarios etc. but it s perfectly acceptable to have your view take a model without an intermediary view model especially if the view model is just a class of getter and setter with no other functionality

6456943
hide	show
so you cant use delay with show and hide

6456959
ubuntu	debian
for example in debian ubuntu you can just install second version from package postgresql-8.4 and postgresql-9.0 and everything works out of the box thanks to postgresql-common

6456964
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is supported in ie 9 firefox 5 and google-chrome 12 but not safari 5 on win 7

client-side	server-side
i am thinking about writing a web app using knockout.js for the client-side and cakephp for the server-side

6457021
getter	setter
felix king s answer is right on i just wanted to point out that there is an alternate syntax for defining setter and getter in ecmascript 5

6457029
put	get
just an idea but if you want to create a unique directory name for each ua just put the ua through md5 and get something like

6457041
google-chrome	firefox
i m ok with running google-chrome or firefox with specific options or opening permissions in some other way

6457076
inherited	properties
all the properties and methods of the parent class is inherited in the child class so theoretically you can access them in the child class but beware using the protected keyword in your class because it throws a fatal error when used in the child class

6457104
mouse	keyboard
it s a little annoying but you need to right click on the element and then keeping your mouse over the link use your keyboard select the inspect element link and press enter

6457115
width	height
if you meant the actual size of the li element then you can change that as normal with width and height

6457170
pop-up	dialog
what i mean by fails is that typically when you execute the exporttopdf method a dialog box pop-up with the name of the pdf file it s size and whether you want to open it or save it

6457198
converter	multibinding
another way to do this is using a multibinding and converter on the button you want to enable disable

6457198
converter	multibinding
while this approach does work i tend to agree with the other answers in that you should use commands when possible over multibinding and converter

6457220
mouseup	mousedown
my button handler gets called twice - once for mousedown touchstart and a second time for mouseup touchend

6457220
mouseup	mousedown
examining the event objects passed to the handler in chrome devtools i can see that they re both simulated tap events the first originating from mousedown and the second from mouseup

6457245
junit	mockito
i m learning mockito at the moment and one of the things i m doing to consolidate my learning is converting an old junit test from using a hand rolled mock class to one which uses mockito mocks instead

6457261
width	height
add a meta tag that sets the height and width to the device-height device-width you can allow the user to zoom by changing the maximum-scale to something above 1 however zoom is disabled in the following example i believe mobile safari allows a value up to 10

6457261
width	height
viewport.attr content height device-width width device-height initial-scale 1.0 maximum-scale 1.0

6457261
width	height
viewport.attr content height device-height width device-width initial-scale 1.0 maximum-scale 1.0

6457261
width	height
the if then statement in the event handler checks for which orientation the user has changed to 90 -90 and 270 are all values i ve seen for landscape and the lines just switch the height and width values in the viewport tag

6457262
versioning	upgrade
i also only have leopard installed as the company i work for does not wish to purchase an upgrade so close to a new versioning being released

6457265
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this works correctly in ie7 google-chrome and opera and i think in firefox 2 but not in firefox 4

6457265
opera	google-chrome
comparing to google-chrome and opera and ie7 the offsetwidth of the cells are a mixture of 44 and 43 pixels but adding up to the correct final width of 1311

6457266
post	get
specifically i d like to post some json to the server and get json back so my code looks like this

6457275
put	get
should i put like more methods in the service class which interact with the entities which would get the user and check everything for log in action get parent if needed and then just return the log in result to run method

6457276
pull	push
you can either periodically check the tasks for changes or use push pull notifications in case of exchange 2010 there are also streaming notifications available

6457294
addition	multiplication
the fact that the multiplication comes before the addition is irrelevant

6457385
cos	exp	cos	sin	printf	strtod
my program have reading of full precision values with strtod doing a lot of different operations on them like +- sin cos exp and other from and printf -ing of them

6457385
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
support for additional types includes the arithmetic operators add subtract multiplying divide

6457443
postgresql	mysql
pick an open source databases either mysql or postgresql dependant upon which your team is most familiar with and how it integrates into the rest of your infrastructure stack

6457476
gridbaglayout	miglayout
you could use gridbaglayout or the non-standard miglayout if you want to code the gui by hand

6457490
squash	merge	squash	branch
so i have a local git topic branch vacation which i need to merge back into master to dcommit but i don t want to squash all the commits into one big one

6457529
submit	submission
that this would mean you d have to say yes when the app store submission process asks if your app includes encryption meaning extra paperwork and time before you could submit the app

6457565
inherited	properties
the issue is that i was using reflection for the looping on all the properties and this will cause a problem when you do this piece of code and you are using some inherited

6457571
public	protected
if you are attempting to keep others from taking advantage of your classes resources you can leave the modifier off private public protected which will make the class package protected the default when no modifier is present

6457591
cout	ofstream
if i m writing to the terminal i will use the std cout object whereas if i m writing to a file i ll create and use a std ofstream object

6457591
cout	ofstream	std	ostream
since both std cout and std ofstream objects inherit from the std ostream class i figured i would create a sort of print_output function that accepts a std ostream object

6457627
stdout	stderr
if you are sure the output is coming out on stdout via the print statement replace stderr with stdout

6457669
config	ini
however if i do not try to change the script the default layout layout.phtml is working fine set in my ini config

6457711
opensso	openam
we are looking to use openam opensso to act as a sso provider

6457760
post	get
get and post make get and post requests respectively which is useful if you are building a restful service

6457760
post	get
edit i actually don t see get and post methods on the ajax object

6457772
google-chrome	firefox
i have a bit of a problem with streaming mp3s in ie and google-chrome it works fine in firefox

6457772
mp3	wav
the web app streams the wav file by converting it on the fly to mp3 using lame not great but we have to do it is this way because of limitations of asterisk and then outputs the content as a binary stream

6457772
google-chrome	firefox
why does firefox not have any problems but ie and google-chrome

6457793
unix	solaris
however it s much more portable you said any unix but the linux and solaris way is to look in the proc filesystem - and other unixes may have different apis to just parse the output of ps for example to eliminate any extraneous output than to do any system-specific process stuff

6457822
updatepanel	onclientclick
if there isnâ t an event that can be easily handled it seemed like it might work to add an updatepanel with updatemode conditional and an asyncpostbacktrigger that pointed to a hidden button with an onclientclick event handler that would get the active tab index â but that seems like a lot of moving pieces for something that iâ d expect the dom to expose already

6457836
writetofile	nsdata
i think the issue is the returned nsdata is just a light wrapper around an array allocated with malloc and that writetofile does not know how to handle this

6457843
submit	submission
try to remove the submit event handler before submission the form again

6457846
put	get
i have given the tick to the first answer as that put me on the right track to find the solution although it might not be 100 correct its working in order to get this to work i followed answer number 1 but then in the view i did the following

6457870
prepare	execute
try to prepare and execute the query

qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
the data in qnetworkreply is not ready immediately after the call to qnetworkaccessmanager get

6458818
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
the call is asynchronous and you need to connect to either the finished signal of qnetworkaccessmanager or readyread signal of qnetworkreply before you attempt to retrieve any data

6458821
qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager	qnetworkreply	qudpsocket	qnetworkreply	qtcpserver	qtcpserver	qnetworkaccessmanager	qtcpserver	qudpsocket	qnetworkrequest	qnetworkaccessmanager	qnetworkrequest	qudpsocket	qnetworkrequest	qnetworkreply	qnetworkrequest	qtcpserver	qnetworkrequest	qtcpsocket	qtcpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager	qtcpsocket	qudpsocket	qtcpsocket	qnetworkreply	qtcpsocket	qtcpserver	qudpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager

6458949
keydown	onkeyup
onkeyup not keydown or keypress as the input s value won t have the new keystroke in it yet

6458984
onresume	onpause
it would probably be best if you put that logic to close in onpause and then again initialized in onresume

6458997
put	get
if you subclass uiimageview and put that code in it you will only get the touches from that view you will probably need to set the acceptsuserinteraction to yes

6459124
int	chars
i m guessing the type of the variable ret is wrong unsigned chars instead of int and thus -1 is getting converted modulo 256 to 255

zoo	xts
if i understand correctly this is easily accomplished with either zoo or xts

6459154
zoo	xts
now we load the xts package which also loads zoo

width	height
suppose theta is the angle by which you want to rotate and suppose that the object s width is 2w while its height is 2h

6459227

i also note that caliburn.micro is a viewmodel first approach but in wp7 you have to navigate to a page first

6459758
google-chrome	firefox

width	height
the css forces the link to expand to the full width and height of the td

google-chrome and firefox probably have no problem with it and run it just fine for some reason

6460423
post	get
i came across some post that tell how to get an isoformat string but not the other way round

6460428
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
the buttons imagebuttons inside a container such as a gridview listview repeater etc have their click event bubbled up to the container itself

6460452

also look up awtevent.getid mouseevent keyevent in the api docs

6460536
mouse	keyboard
this is how the software i work on monitors mouse and keyboard to see if the user is busy working and locks the window if they re not

6460565
button	checkbox
then it will show you message when ever you will click on one or there is a button which will give you the actual state of all checkbox

6460595
titlebar	window
you can start a browser in such and if there s no window manager and desktop environment running the browser will be the only thing visible no decorations titlebar or the like

6460599
getter	setter
that the according getter setter methods are there

6460606

ubuntu	linux
i run ubuntu linux 11.04 x86_64 but i can boot into my windows 7 partition if needed

6460627
return-value-optimization	nrvo
in this case the return-value-optimization nrvo is trivially applied

6460691
subtract	add
what you should do is just access the array by subtract 1 from the index but if you want to access starting at index 1 add an nsnull first

6460747
google-chrome	firefox
this works flawlessly in firefox and google-chrome but in ie9 the javascript function is not even being called

6460813
pop-up	dialog
say i m using a generic javascript library such as colorbox to pop-up a dialog on the screen and prompt the user for information

6460822
cufft	fftw
cufft has the same behavior as fftw it computes unnormalized ffts

6460822
cufft	fftw
there are some padding differences between fftw and cufft with c2r and r2c that can screw up a simple comparison but not for c2c

6460822
cufft	fftw
i would double-check your data setup and length calculations and verify your plan in both fftw and cufft

6460839
width	height
the library isn t perfect my brief time spent with it i ve leared that it doesn t seem to render radial gradients with more than 2 colors and it doesn t allow scaling it appears you can only change the width and height properties which is both strange and very unfortunate but at least now i can include the code for the graphics instead of using assets

6460858
inherited	subclassing
if you want to inherited content from the main translation you d have to write your own contentproxy subclassing with a customized _inherit_from method

6460859
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
in my uiviewcontroller that i use for my uipopovercontroller i have a label on top a segmented control and then a uitableview below it

6460882
uiview	subviews
i ve discovered that if you put a custom cell s subviews on a uiview that is between approximately 300 and 320 points wide and then add said subviews to the cell s content view it will not move the subviews upon triggering editing mode

6460887
firefox	safari
i have tried using both safari and firefox but neither of them work

6460943
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in google-chrome firefox opera and safari and all browser use for both technique a limit of 5 mb

6460943
opera	safari
- in opera and safari you can store more than 5mb of localstorage

6460944
google-chrome	firefox
the update works fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie a bit of space is added between the list and the button every time it updates

6460944
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it stays put

6460947
width	margin
i wrote the following jquery to display the hidden div then update the css to the automatic generated width of the table and change the margin to center it

6461147
put	get
if i put the following code after injecting the jquery script i still get an error

6461168
int	double
all arithmetic is done using signed bigint or double values so you should not use unsigned big int larger than 9223372036854775807 63 bits except with bit functions

6461183
prop	each
you need to groupby the prop value and then select the first member of each subset

6461184
int	boolean
you might change the variable foundblock and the return of your connect function to boolean or at least an int since string is overkill for what you re describing and since string checks for equality are not performed with the operator

6461197
opensso	openam
openam is the open source authentication authorization entitlement and federation software derived from sun microsystem s opensso

6461199
getter	setter

although you can gzip using a reverse proxy such as nginx lighttpd or in varnish

6461224
hash	salt	pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt
my sites now use an algorithm very similar to pbkdf2 that i lifted from bruce schneier and niels ferguson s book practical cryptography for which i use 512 bit random salt and sha512 storage is cheap plus many thousands of iterations to hash a clear text

6461290
width	height
this will then tell you the height and width of the string

6461342
mp4	webm
since i m only using html javascript i can only play webm mp4 and ogg files

this works fine in ie8+ google-chrome and firefox but unfortunately i need to support ie 7 as well

6461397
ppl	tbb
intel s tbb and microsoft s ppl included in vs2010 do not suffer these issues

6461401
onsubmit	onkeyup
so you need to connect to the onsubmit event on the form instead of onkeypress or onkeyup

6461408
oncreate	recreate
normally when there s an orientation change android will actually destroy your activity and recreate it by mean of oncreate again so any data that was obtained will be lost unless the state is saved in the onconfigurationchanged method

6461476
width	height
you need to set the height and width prolly on the containing div as well not just the image

6461480
mouse	keyboard
this happens to me from time to time because i use synergy to share my keyboard mouse between multiple computers

6461489
portrait	landscape
i have implemented the method willrotatetointerfaceorientation and my iphone app nicely animates the orientation movement when i switch between landscape and portrait

6461513
width	height
set each anchor to the height and width of the sprite like you would the divs

6461525
profiling	debugging
i would suspect that may suffer greatly from debugging builds so try some optimization flags if you didn t do that already you always should for profiling

6461542
post	get
so rather than testing specific class behaviors as you do with unit tests you ll want to be creating objects in the database and making get post etc

6461542
rspec	capybara
lately i have liked using steak inside of rspec for my integration tests using capybara to facilitate the web interaction

6461550
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
one way to do this is to log titlelabel.text currenttitle and titleforstate in viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisappear and viewdiddisappear

6461621
ubuntu	opensuse
we first tried some modern ubuntu 11 and 11 and opensuse mono for vmware release from here we use every day

tested in ie7 8 9 firefox google-chrome safari opera

6461660
background-color	transparency
the general consensus on creating a uiview with a clear background requires adding html code to set the background-color transparency like this.

6461673
public	protected
public protected and friends aren t really keywords just the names of important methods which are called during the creation of modules or classes

6461683
onclick	onsubmit
to the action that you are wanting to prevent is the onsubmit not the onclick

6461699
int	boolean
of course the majority of those stored values are small int or boolean

6461711

i ve been trying to switching two views from two separate view controllers for a while and it never works the simulator always crashes to the home screens

6461742
hide	show
i have had to on a couple of occassions go from a fade effect to a show hide effect

6461803
gif	png
you can use a gif or an 8 bit png here though and get better results

6461803
hide	show
what i do is make a browser check for ie 7 and if i detect 7 i then switch to hide show as opposed to fades

6461812
hash	md5
my first thought was to create an md5 hash of a json encoded value like so body is the variable referred to above

6461818
width	height
i have set up the image size to be the width height of the tablet device in portrait 600x1024

6461827
firefox	safari
therefore when safari which in my experience is following the appcache standard a little more strictly than firefox sees a request for a web address that is not in the appcache it does not allow access

6461832
background-color	transparency
one thing you can do to fix this is easily is that if the background behind the transparency png is a solid color you can give the div element with the png image background-color attribute as well

6461869
hide	show
need to use one single button to toggle the show and hide for div

6461869
hide	show
but after i show and hide it once whenever i tried to show it again it starts chaining show hide show hide by itself without any clicks

6461869
hide	show
it seems it s just a loop that everytime it doubles the amount of looping like show hide for 2 4 8 16 32 times .... the more i do the longer it loops

6461869
hide	show
i tried to remove the click part in the hidetable function the loop stops but still whenever i try to hit showtable it will show then hide it self automatically like it s auto executing the stuff in the click function without any clicks.

6461869
hide	show
because i need a way to track which div to show and hide and change the the text in corresponding button

6461870
width	height	portrait	landscape
also i want it to change its appearance layout when due to screen rotation the widget size changes because 3x1 has different height and width in landscape and portrait

6461901
qapplication	qstyle
internally when you call qapplication setstylesheet qt creates a qstyle sub-class called qstylesheetstyle

6461907
google-chrome	firefox
i have known ie to choke on trailing commas in object or array definitions though firefox and google-chrome usually seem to be able to handle it

6461940
hide	show
this will put an onlick on your buttons inside your div which will find the closest parent div with class toggleable and will either hide show your div

6461943
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
google java read file java write file java list directory - that is basically everything you need. the important thing is the use of bufferedreader bufferedwriter for pulling and pushing the text in to the files and realising that there is no particular code science involved in writing html to a file

6461961
firefox	safari
i usually just use the following jquery for mvc project on fields which need a watermark the code compatible with ie 6 - 9 firefox 2 - 4 safari 4

6461965
post	get
just change the method from post to get

6461965

colorbox	thickbox
i think the problem is in the way thickbox and colorbox are written

6462838
colorbox	thickbox
colorbox is implemented as a jquery plugin which is a bit different and better than thickbox s sort-of-self-contained widget model

6462838
colorbox	thickbox
the difference is where thickbox would automatically find things with the class of thickbox and apply the effect colorbox needs you to tell it which elements to work on

6462838
colorbox	thickbox
this will initialise colorbox on any links in the page with the class of thickbox with the default settings

i can currently get a new row for every message and hide show all of them but i am not able to figure out how to get the reply button to target the unique row to reply a message

6470845
portrait	landscape
i don t know why the picture are always landscape even though they were taken portrait

6470845
portrait	landscape
i already send hopefully in the post request enough information to check if it s portrait or landscape but i cannot rotate the image properly

6470851
width	height
the dot language has a graph attribute called size for specifying the maximum width and height of the output in inches

6470851
width	height
so i think to make it one page wide and three pages high assuming the pages are portrait you could set the size attribute s width to the width of a page in inches if you re using american letter size i think that s 8 1 2 inches or a4 is 8.3 inches and the height 3 times the height of a page or larger

6470884
stdout	stderr
the reason why install.sh gets killed seems to be that stdout and stderr are closed when the ssh session is yanked so writing to them fails

6470884
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout stderr into install.out and then tail -f it

6470922
margin	height
shouldn t the p tag s height padding and margin be calculated into the height of the body

6470942
int	double
then that data has to be cast to the appropriate types be it bool int double etc

6470942
int	double	int	chars
bytebuffer has functions that return int double long short float and chars as well as ones to put all of those types and a few other useful functions like translating the entire structure into an int array

6470942
for-loop	arrays
as for the bit shifting shift the entire arrays before wrapping it as a bytebuffer as suggested by vidstige in the same way the first if else in the for-loop does and everything will be in order

6470947
awt	swing
for instance you would do well to learn how to use the swing awt layout managers and avoiding using null layout setbounds

6471004
stdout	fflush
so it looks like node.js can t fflush the stdout stream and everything is kept in memory

6471027
hide	show
edit sorry about it being vague what i currently have is 2 buttons in a contentcontrol when clicking one of the buttons it hide that contentcontrol and show a different contentcontrol with its own set of controls and a back button

6471027
hide	show
when clicking that back button it hide the current contentcontrol and show the original

6471051
stdout	fflush
if you want your code to look sync use streamlinejs as described here node.js stdout fflush

6471061
hide	show
you should probably make two user controls and hide show them when clicking the buttons

6471091
equals	gethashcode
equals or gethashcode

6471141
calloc	malloc
being bored with calloc in fact always have been since my early c coding days i changed the arrays to be nsmutablearrays and guess what guard malloc again stopped at the same line of code this time with the nsmutablearray replacing the float32 pointers but because it is objective-c it also told me that the index was out of bounds and gave me a stack trace

6471141
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
there you have it when you get a exec_bad_access in your main watch out for calloc malloc free and check double check and recheck your indices

6471150
mouseleave	mouseenter
in that case the mouseenter event on the child menu should cancel the normal behavior of the mouseleave event on the parent menu the dropdown should not close

6471150
mouseleave	mouseenter
the problem when you try to set this up in a normal straightforward way is that the mouseleave event on the parent menu fires before the mouseenter event on the child menu and the child menu closes before the mouse can enter it

6471150
mouseleave	mouseenter
there are separate handlers for mouseenter and mouseleave events for the individual menu item its parent menu and its child menu

6471159
width	height
i d like to specify a default width and height to make it more useful

6471190
caliburn	prism
the framework that i like most because it s simple to understand and learning curve is not so steep is the mvvm light toolkit but there is also prism and caliburn

6471192
mouse	keyboard
you need to set up a global hook to listen for keyboard and mouse events

6471192
mouse	keyboard
i have a c# class that does this and raises .net keyboard and mouse event args but i am not going to post the code online as this type of activity can be used for nefarious means

6471192
mouse	keyboard
we embedded powerpoint into our application but we didn t want the user editing the powerpoint slides while viewing them so from our c# application we set up a hook to monitor and intercept mouse and keyboard events if they were in the powerpoint control

6471208
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
to compare the md5 hash you would need to query the database based on the user name enter in the login and return the known md5 hash and the salt if there is one

6471208
hash	salt
then hash the given password with the known salt

6471347
google-chrome	safari
they come with google-chrome and safari i believe

6471380
getter	setter
the relevant sections of the jpa-annotated java classes are below getter and setter mostly omitted

6471386
maven	pom.xml
i accomplished this with some targetpath trickery in my maven pom.xml

6471410
min	max
i believe that the greatest error is introduced when i m taking the average of the max and the min and then the error is multiplied by the factor which can be a float

6471477
ssl	https
edit ssl https is out of the question

6471532
int	double
each custom object is made up of int a int b string c and double d

6471551
width	height
the only problem is i want to be able to enforce a maximum width and maximum height on these images without messing up the aspect ratio but i cannot check the size and do resizing math before hand since the bbcode parser is not that smart

6471573
post	get
are you sure that you are using get and not post

6471594
puts	gets
i have been able to successfully tunnel out of the proxy for gets but puts are all failing on the dooutput

6471612
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i think google-chrome firefox and opera do at time of writing.

6471660
post	get
if you post some code on jsfiddle for example you may get a more specific answer

6471699
width	height
i think createbitmap int width int height bitmap.config config only uses config you can use other variant create bitmap may be

6471702
hide	show
i d also go ahead and trigger the event handler at load to give an initial show hide state using a name-spaced event to avoid causing other bound functionality executing

6471706
google-chrome	firefox
i already tested in other browsers google-chrome 11 firefox and ie8 and everything works fine

6471808
ant	maven
this uses ant not maven but may be of some help nevertheless

6471832
activemq	rabbitmq
i evaluated rabbitmq activemq hornetq and redis and found redis to offer the best mix of ease of installation simplicity and performance

6471841
sorting	filtering
datatables allows you to add sorting paging filtering limiting and more to any html table

6471860
shadowing	named
also you have a named shadowing problem - the parameter array_size of type long is shadowing the static member with the same named albeit of type int

6471893
folder	directory
also just for interest and learning i notice in the java installation that there is a jre folder inside the java-sdk-1.6.xxx folder and also another one in the same directory as the java-sdk-1.6.xxx folder

6471923
sorting	filtering
it gives you quite a few new features including sorting paging filtering limiting searching and ajax loading

6471957
put	get
i want to put it the select count statement in this linq statement so i can get the sales count in my linq statement

6471967
listview	gridview
i tried declaring an abslistview i can t declare gridview or listview because i don t know which one it is until runtime like this

6471967
tablet	galaxy
which works on an asus eee transformer tablet but not samsung galaxy or htc desire it just crashes log cat doesn t tell me anything

6472008
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and safari the following works

6472015
put	get	post	get	post	put
get head post put

6472042
for-loop	loops
it seems you are resetting the variable e in the second for-loop causing it to loops endlessly

6472101
jar	war
my opinion is that the package checkbox see the screenshot below has been unchecked for the apache commons fileupload library or jar file and therefore netbeans will no longer package this into the war ear file

6472104
dom4j	xerces
basically i used jxpath and xerces as well as dom4j and javax

6472145
width	height
the call to cudamemcpy2d as written assumes that h_ref is a 2d-array of width x height float elements stored contiguously when in fact it is a 1d-array of width pointers

6472145
width	height
instead of representing the matrix as a 1d array of vectors i would suggest storing it in a 1d array of width x height floats and using macros for access based on row column

6472153
pow	math.h
use the pow function from math.h

6472156
getter	setter
i imagine when using explicit getter and setter we would do something like

6472156
getter	setter
if we use implicit getter and setter we can define validation rules within the cfc itself such as

6472160
min	max
my volumechanged method gets hit every time the button is pressed even if the volume does not change as a result because it s already at max min

6472163
rsa	dsa
putty has a very handy tool for going back and forth between dsa rsa and ppk certificates which you can download here

6472163
rsa	dsa
just about every tool you ll use other than putty that establishes ssh connections will use either a dsa or a rsa key-pair

6472178
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox safari and google-chrome ie8

6472225
put	get
in order for you to get access to this context you have to put code inside the view s drawrect

6472267
disk	ram
except in very rare cases where the entire database is stored in ram mysql databases are ultimately stored on disk

6472275
superclass	subclassing
you can t change the ivars in a superclass without recompiling all subclassing known and unknown or you ll risk crashing

6472282
children	parent
if so then if you build not save the pages and then save the report rails will try to save the dependent children and will not save the parent if the children fail to save

6472304
public	protected
onresume is normally protected but i override it and make it public so that my activitygroup can call it

6472315
post	put
i m working on a image editor uploader based around pixastic where i grab image data out of an tag put it into a canvas and after manipulating it encode the data in base 64 and post it to my app with javascript where it will be saved as a new image file

6472329
public	protected
the webmethod attribute is attached to a public method cannot be attached to a private protected that you want the method exposed as part of the .net web service

6472333
width	height
the interface you re looking for is iamstreamconfig on the source filter s output pin this lets you specify fps and height and width etc

6472348
public	protected
the webmethod attribute is attached to a public method cannot be attached to a private protected that you want the method exposed as part of the .net web service

udp	tcp
tcp and udp connection tables

6472390
inherited	properties
i just needed to configure the superhuman to map inherited properties like so

6472421
postgresql	mysql
also since we are moving from this model where each site is independent each site has its own database and i quite like it that way especially since we are using relational databases mysql but migrating to postgresql so its much easier to shard this way

6472429
inherited	subclassing
it s just important to note that inherited arrays and objects are not copied to instances with this implementation - so if you inherited an array you ll want to redifine its values in the subclassing constructor function otherwise all instances will share a single array - i can post an example for you if you want to see there is also one in the comments of that post

6472438
fseek	ftell
using fopen fseek ftell fwrite and fclose

6472445
qtextedit	qpushbutton	qdialog	qpushbutton
i have created a simple qdialog that has a qtextedit and a qpushbutton

this then led to a further problem where the iframe came back empty in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie bizarrely

6472500
post	get
i tried get post but i have no idea in how to notify a player that s waiting to move and how to preserve the game state

6472525
pdfsharp	migradoc
we use pdfsharp and migradoc to generate pdf files on the fly

6472629
uiapplication	uiwindow
i don t think there is any official documentation on how the modal is implemented but any view can get the uiwindow of the uiapplication and call -presentmodal.

6472636
int	boolean
easiest way to do that is keep a boolean or int track of occurrences nmatches then print no-match-message at the end if nmatches is 0 or false before you close the file or the pathname goes out of context

6472636
int	boolean
also you might like to abstract the functionality into a function find_occurrences searchstring pathname which returns int or boolean noccurrences .

6472648
children	parent
i m having a hard time using updatedata because i never actually call domodal on the preference boxes because they re children of the parent dialog container and they are just bound to the picture control in the dialog

6472660
hide	show
when someone selects an item in the list hide the 1st panel and show the edit panel in that same page

6472673
postgresql	mysql
this will export your mysql sqlite or postgresql db on your development machine and import it into your heroku instance

6472682
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
either audiotoolbox or avfoundation will be your best bet maybe a mix of the two

6472685
salt	md5
use md5 sha1 or whatever encryption you want with a salt

6472690
google-chrome	safari
however the latest versions of google-chrome and safari have support for websockets

6472735
hash	md5
if an attacker would get to your database and get the md5 hash it is almost certain that he will be also able to crack them

6472735
hash	md5
md5 hash of weak passwords can be cracked even bruteforce by a casual computer

6472788
hash	salt
it doesn t affect how fast an attacker can try a candidate password given the hash and the salt from your database

6472791
stdout	stderr
but you could have in input stderr and stdout of ffmpeg

6472846
profiling	debugging
one other issue is that i had to run ngen with both the profiling and debugging flags to make sure i could do both

6472858
folder	directory
however when the process is started the program it launches ends up looking for all resources in the workingdirectory instead of pulling user content from that folder and all other content from the directory the exe resides in

6472873
hide	show
now based on a functionality i hide and show some columns in the same grid editgrid and when i click add row it again show the same previous fields instead of new ones

6472873
hide	show
now based on the functionality i hide date client and amount fields and show tax total closed fields

6472912

assuming you have a children collection in the parent with one to many relation

6472959
rss	feed
i have an input rss feed with some elements already added with namespace prefix for itunes

6472961
put	get
you need to use method calls get put etc. for that

6472982
division	multiplication
although it has been two years i felt i might as well add my penithworth for a really fast way to detect overflow for at least additions which might give a lead for multiplication division and power-of

6472997
int	double
i m running into a bit of an issue with determining if the user input is an int or double

6472997
int	double
i need to figure out how to determine based on the scanner if the input is a int or double for the above methods

6473010
versioning	upgrade
what kind of development environment needed to upgrade a webapplication developed in older versioning of ruby deployed in linux to latest versioning 2.3.11

6473018
stdout	stderr
the output can be captured within c# by redirecting stdout stderr

6473042
hide	show
an entirely different approach would be to tie the selection to the addition removal of one or more css classes to the form container coupled with css rules to hide show portions of the form

6473068
hide	show
because jquery is the bee s knees instead of separate hide show functions this will suffice given just as above

6473075
autofac	ioc-container
using an ioc-container like unity autofac or others you have to register and resolve the iinterface to get the instance

6473218
int	chars
of course the above will work only if sizeof chars isn t the same as sizeof int

6473245
int	double
in this case you can detect if an input is an int double or just obtain an entire line

6473276
spaces	delimiter
i m writing a regular expression to parse arguments in a fashion similar to shell arguments with spaces and quoted strings as the delimiter as well as backslash escaping

6473318
keydown	keyup
inside the keyup handler you determine if the key was being pressed and if so calculate the duration by subtracting the time-stamps of the keyup keydown events

6473373
submit	submission
submission is only allowed when a user manually loads a page and submit the

6473398
implements	sealed	implements	extends
wcf is very extensible except scenarios where you want to extends already implements protocols - those classes are mostly sealed internal and cannot be reused

6473407
post	get
maybe if you do an ajax http request post to a php serverside script and get back the response and then do the alert based on that response you could do what you re wanting

6473420
int	double
the decimal tells the compiler that you want a floating point number instead of an int and the f tells the compiler to use the float type instead of double

6473533
post	get
yes just use a post method instead of get

6473550
width	height
iframe src height 100 width 100 iframe

6473600
width	height
it becomes very hard to check conditions that involve multiple attributes if a product s size medium then the weight must be between 1 and 10 pounds if a product s height is specified then a width is required as well so people don t make those checks

6473600
width	height
and then you ll discover when the application is being configured that you missed a ton of requirements that only became clear when the attributes were defined-- you can t know that width is required if height is specified if you don t know whether they re going to store height or width in the first place

6473624
nsscanner	nsxmlparser
for a simple result you can even use nsscanner and not go deep into the nsxmlparser

6473646
user-controls	elementhost
this user-controls is what you would then display in the elementhost

6473654
width	height
for the progressbar you may wish to hard code a small size say 40dip width and also height

6473656
margin	height
use js to calculate the necessary positioning or padding margin needed to center the element after calculating the height of the container and child element

6473673
accessor	properties
if the mailaddress constructor or its argument expressions or the assignment to from if it is a properties accessor throws an exception the mailmessage will not be disposed

6473677
int	double
it is an interesting detail that the int will be retrieved as double from javascript indicating that there really was a forward and backward mapping to a javascript data object

6473698
javassist	cglib
i m not sure whether this is what you re looking for but consider javassist or cglib library

6473698
implements	extends
cglib is a powerful high performance and quality code generation library it is used to extends java classes and implements interfaces at runtime

6473737
cassette	squishit
cassette similar to squishit and requestreduce which is quite different than anything else by automagically doing everything for you

6473750
vim	emacs
do yourself a huge favor choose to learn either vim or emacs suffer with the mental phase shifting for a week and do all of your work via ssh to the linux box

6473769
postgresql	mysql
i haven t tried using postgresql with ado.net but from my experience using it with mysql you might be better off sticking with sql server if you plan to use linq to sql or entity framework

6473773
listview	gridview
i had thought about giving up and just using my asp .net skillset and creating formviews and gridview bound to the proper listview datasources

i need to create a subclassing of a existing class which i know how to do but i need to be able to create the subclassing based off a existing superclass without modifying the superclass

6473814
deselect	multi-select
i have 2 multi-select dropdown boxes ddb i use jquery mobile .once user selects the items from ddb1 based on his selection i need to populate ddb2.i have used jquery.change in ddb1.but the issue i face is that onchange is called every time the user selects deselect an item from ddb1 i understand that this is the expected behavior and not when the whole selection is over

6473856
httpresponse	request
when that class handles the request it returns an httpresponse instead of the standard file like object

6473875
int	double
however i doubt you re lecturer is trying to catch you out with and will probably just be giving you int and double

6473875
int	double
casting a double to an int results in the decimal portion of the number being discarded

6473892
copying	overwrite
note that tenuring an object will have exactly the same effect but instead of copying it to to-space it s copied to the old generation heap - we end up with a copy of the data in from space that isn t overwrite

6473901
hide	show
for the first part since after hours of looking i cannot find a jquery plugin that allows for multiple divs that show on click and hide any current div that s open

6473918
jfreechart	jchart2d
libraries that aren t acceptable thus far those without 3d points jfreechart jchart2d

6473931
superclass	subclassing
the author of the superclass should be able to rewrite it without breaking subclassing and vice versa

6473972
clang	llvm
like mkroehnert and puzzle said neither llvm clang nor gcc actually come with a set of frameworks

6473972
nsstring	nsobject
gcc comes with only a small runtime that doesn t provide nsarray nsstring not even nsobject

6474016
daemons	launchd
and if you want to launchd you daemons when you linux start you should find out which init version you are using in you distro but usually you can just add command to execute you daemons to etc init.d rc but it seems to be no so good idea

6474039
ubuntu	linux
my first choice of linux distribution is ubuntu but i ve heard that in ubuntu eclipse is can be bugged or slow

6474083
width	height
you are setting the max width and height to a very large size

6474085
put	get
i m hoping for better answers but i wanted to put these in here in case i don t get them or to give people looking for the same info the few links i ve found

6474094
png	ico
for now im using server generated png - ico - tray but this is ugly and slow ....

6474132
post	get
the webclient provides the querystring namevaluecollection which is designed exactly to pass parameters in a querystring and it works just on get methods so in my case the querystring collection doesn t fit because while uploading the file the webclient is actually doing a post

6474177
post	get
the solution is to do a post redirect get or to use a nonce key

6474184
hash	md5
i m using the md5 algorithm to hash the key for an on-disk hash table i know it s questionable whether this is the best algorithm to use for this but i m going with it for now

6474184
hash	md5
where key is the value being hash and n is the number of bits of the md5 result i want to use

6474199
entities	entitymanager
i have a dao in which most of the entities are mapped directly to columns using jpa annotations so i use the entitymanager and it works great with no issues

6474215
jobs	cron
it seems as though most of the gems god whenever etc... rely on calling cron jobs

6474270
nsuinteger	nsmutablearray
the reason for this is that an nsarray stores nsobject s so any time that you have an int float nsinteger nsuinteger etc that you wish to store in an nsarray or nsmutablearray you will need to convert it into an object

6474302
jar	.war
don t include the jar file into the deployment assembly so that it will not get exported to .war file

6474325
int	double	int	chars
just to clarify double is a primitive type like int or chars

6474331
pop-up	dialog
your use of the words window pop-up you mean modal dialog

6474404
width	height
because the preview will require some manipulation it will be a smaller percentage of the original height and width i would like to use jquery to calculate the dimensions of the preview programmatically rather than simply hard-code it

6474405
bmp	png
build up the image that you want or convert from jpg bmp png as a dib and convert to an hicon

6474441
accessor	properties
if you still want a single access point you can map a third ignored properties that implements it s get and set accessor with the two first properties

6474453
post	get
actionautocompletetest will get the data sent by cjuiatocomplete via post

6474515
entities	entitymanager
update statements are usually pretty simple so you might as well use the normal doctrine2 way programmatically updating entities and calling entitymanager flush or using dql updates

6474538
google-chrome	firefox
edit 3 - ok here s the code but google-chrome and sea monkey and firefox don t display it correctly

6474548
udp	tcp
how or whether it s fits into the context the real-time multi-user games like the conventional tcp and udp protocol or

6474591
innodb	myisam
the table may be myisam or innodb

6474613
post	get
the technique mentioned in another post on this page of getting a page with a comments plugin on it probably wont work unless your getter is actually a browser than will run javascript - i have tried this with a like button on a page i want scraped and no dice an admin on that page actually has to click like for it to get scraped

6474635
folder	directory
these folder are stored within the mysql data directory

6474678
post	get
in the ajax call i would make post call instead of get

from this great explanation about the differences between webviewclient and webchromeclient it seems that if you use one you shouldn t be using the other for the same webview object

6474771
cout	cin
in your case assuming you only want to use std cout and std cin just an example you can do this

6474792
inherited	properties
the inkcanvas isn t a panel type note it inherited from frameworkelement but it does contain attached properties as ed s

6474837
puts	gets
i have a php page which gets loads of persons from a db then sorts them and finally puts all persons

6474876
ant	maven
i have a project that i am migrating from ant to maven

6474876
maven	pom.xml
i figured i would just import this build into our internal maven repo and list it as a dependency in the project s pom.xml file

6474877
children	parent
each parent has_many children and accepts_nested_attributes_for children as in railscasts #196 and #197

6474893
google-chrome	firefox
i have some code that uses dispatchevent to simulate clicks and the same exact code works fine in google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox

6474893
google-chrome	firefox
i m clicking on a link that loads another page and the page loads fine in google-chrome but firefox does absolutely nothing when i run this code in firebug or even when i execute it as a bookmarklet

6474899
inherited	subclassing
this is important as inherited is specilisation if would be a subclassing of it should be able to contain but it s not

6474904
innodb	myisam
sure the records are all there in plain text .myd files for myisam the ibdata1 file for innodb tables but it would be a complete time-waster devising a custom app to parse or update the file structure as well as trying to tie in table structure contained in the related files for each table

6474907
pull	push
gitslave is useful when you control and develop on the subprojects at more of less the same time as the superproject and furthermore when you typically want to tag branch push pull etc all repositories at the same time

6474917
screens	tablet
i would assume that things like screens dimensions and orientation would matter on a tablet but in the bits of basic sample code i ve found there hasn t been anything about this

6474918
superclass	subclassing
then override the method in your subclassing you could probably just call the method in the superclass

6474929
int	double
this works great but i want the output xml to include the data type of object properties string int double etc

6474931
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 4 you didn t need to list binaries in the manifest things in components folder are loaded and checked for functions to see if they are xpcom so a google-chrome manifest might have looked like

6474931
google-chrome	firefox
from firefox 4 the google-chrome manifest needs to list your binary files so it then looks like

6474971
put	get
a is a list in which you can put any object implementing record and every object you get out will implement record

6474971
put	get
a is a list in which you can put any object implementing subrecord and every object you get out will implement subrecord

6474978
portrait	landscape
i usually start by making a portrait layout then you can simply make a landscape version of the same layout but for tablet you ll probably want to start landscape since that is the main orientation

6474990
portrait	landscape
this allows the application to load a different layout if you specified a different layout for landscape portrait

6475006
width	height
now i am using timthum for resize the feature images i want to resize with fixed width and height but here the image size was crop here is my code

6475015
put	get	int	double
put a double or a long long int on an address that does not end with 8 or 0 when printed in hex and you are likely to get a core dump

6475015
int	double
double and long long int need to be aligned to 8 byte boundaries

6475038
setinterval	clearinterval
you re declaring a dynamic function in the setinterval your call to clearinterval inside that function will not be able to access the thisfunc variable

6475064
children	parent
what matters is children are beneath their parent

6475071
setattr	subclassing	getattr	metaclass	getattr	subclassing	getattr	setattr	metaclass	setattr	metaclass	subclassing
i was experimenting with metaclass thinking i could manage to override the setattr and getattr functions of the builtin type in the subclassing

6475074
hash	md5
i d recommend you do not give a user one hash we ll say md5 to make this simple and have that remain their sole string of characters

6475086
width	height
if you want to be able to specify a minimum height and width use inline-block

6475093
nsurl	nsdata
note that you are not loading any certificates well technically nsurl will load them internally but this code is most definitely not putting them into the nsdata

6475093
nsurlconnection	nsstream
and most definitely you don t have to go through nsurlconnection first and then through nsstream

6475199
cpu	processors
to set thread to a specific cpu or core you may either use system.threading.thread.beginthreadaffinity or by get the processors thread system.diagnostics.processthread the os thread that is running on the processors and represented by .net managed thread then use processthread.processoraffinity not that processthread.processoraffinity is a set only property

6475227
debian	linux
on debian linux two versions at once is pretty easy

6475228
postgresql	mysql
having been confronted with some bold claims about postgresql s insecurity while hailing mysql s security i d like to get someone else s opinion

6475228
postgresql	mysql
i d have said that postgresql is more security aware than mysql supporting roles more authentication methods ... but that the database itself has generally a very limited impact on the security of an application

6475228
postgresql	mysql
ps both mysql and postgresql are great products - no need for any non-security related discussions

6475263
getter	setter
in your case i d exclude the flowdocument property from serialization and instead have a string property which converts to from flowdocument in the getter setter

it uses the c backend to prepare and execute your mysql queries

6475289
direct3d	directx
direct3d directx locks you into ms platforms only

6475341
x86	64bit
on some systems and generally how it is handled today on your x86 systems for example when you have dram ddr etc in particular ram interfaces with ecc capabilities at the memory layer itself you can only write in complete n bit quantities for example 64bit with 8 bits of ecc because they have to compute in this case the 8 ecc bits from the 64 data bites and write all 72 bits at once when read back all 72 bits are read and checked if good the 64 data bits go back to the user program

6475342
width	height
for me it just comes down to trial and error with regards to setting row and column width height to auto and fixed and then combining this with stackpanels and scrollviewers

6475373
sse	avx
i m using sse avx float vectors

6475446
width	margin
you need to set left 50 on the header element that has position fixed and then apply a negative margin of half that element s width to center it

6475813
postgresql	mysql
it uses the cubrid database but it should be fairly easy to adapt to mysql postgresql firebird etc again a few minutes on google turns up a number of how-to s and tutorials

6475814
postgresql	mysql
sql is a standardized language accepted by both mysql and postgresql and oracle and others...

6475814
postgresql	mysql
i have very little experience with postgresql but i will say that mysql has an outstanding permission system in place that allows users to be delegated a set of available commands on a specific list of databases on a select list client hosts

6478188
bluetooth	usb
i have set up a connection between a bluetooth module and a pc bluetooth usb dongle on the rfcomm protocol

6478205
equals	compareto
different events can have the same timestamp so - if i understand correctly - compareto and equals would be inconsistent

6478205
comparator	comparable
my first approach was to let the event implement comparable and provide comparator like this

6478205
equals	compareto
so compareto would return 0 because they have the same timestamp and are equals for the purpose of sorting

6478205
equals	compareto
i looked at sortedset but it had the same warnings about the consistency of compareto and equals

6478210
readonly	temporary
3-legged oauth if you are dealing with a superadmin user you can request that they grant you temporary right to access the api in readonly mode

6478214
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it only does that in google-chrome not in firefox or safari i didn t test in ie yet

6478235
implements	extends
properties extends hashtable implements map so you can use it in the above method

6478247
equals	compareto
so by the way you implement compareto you should also override equals as

6478265
submit	submission
submission the second form after being re-rendered by a submit of the first form would then visually have no effect

6478283
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
tested on win7 in ie7 ie8 ie9 opera 11 google-chrome 12 firefox 4 safariwin 5

6478286
comparator	comparable
when you implement comparable then you should also override equals object because comparator should only return zero if and only if equals return true

6478286
equals	compareto
compareto t should only return zero if and only if equals object return true

6478286
equals	compareto
compareto equals and hashcode implementation was taken from the implementation you can see in java.lang.long

6478286
comparator	comparable
if you want to have a comparator that evals to 0 when equals must return false as stated in another comment then you must implement a comparator instead of implementing comparable

6478289
implements	extends
i am extends a relative layout in which i am inflating an xml.i added the on click listeners in the class..on click i want to start another activity .i ma not able to start it as i am extends relative layout..how to implements this

background-image	background-color
so when the background-image ends the background-color takes over and ensures a smooth transition without a hard cut-off

6486793
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search

6486847
parentviewcontroller	modalviewcontroller
if you want to follow good design practices the parentviewcontroller needs to delegate the management of its button to the modalviewcontroller

squash	merge	squash	branch
his changes eventually were added to and merge into a master branch with a squash commit

6496058
squash	merge
i am thinking this is because of the squash merge and the fact that it will confuse the merge tracking

6496058

if developers are working on a number of branch and possibly needing each others changes before they go into master is there a way to handle this while continuing with the squash commits on master

webkit	gecko
gecko and presto but not webkit

6496557
webkit	gecko
webkit but not gecko or presto

6496557
webkit	gecko
my guess is that webkit doesn t have the same issue as presto or gecko but instead includes an optimization that gathers style changes applied in the same function and applies them all at once

6496557
webkit	gecko
gecko presto and webkit

6496564

postgresql	mysql
mojoportal supports 5 database platforms ms sql mysql sqlite postgresql and firebird sql

6497763
serializable	deserialization
this provides a very fast serializable deserialization as well as a reasonable transmission size for most data

6497779
filesystems	ntfs
this should work on ntfs filesystems since they support sparse files

6497779
filesystems	fat
for example usb thumbdrives pens are typically formatted with the old fat filesystems by default and it does not support sparse files

6497790
mouseup	mousedown
mouseup and mousedown can be combined by saying handles btnrightpos.mousedown btnrightpos.mouseup like this

6497959
free	malloc
no need for malloc or free

6497968
qbytearray	qchar
you would also need the qchar qbytearray qatomic and qnamespace includes classes all under the corelib folder and you should define qt_no_stl_wchar when compiling

6498014
freemarker	velocity
the liferay s templating system consists of velocity freemarker templates that renders particular html segments of portlets on a page

6498051
scheme	racket
scheme and c++ and racket and pascal and logo and modula-3 and postscript are all turing equivalent meaning that they can all be used to simulate each other and hence that they can all compute the same things

6498122
free	malloc
i removed the unused vars and instead of a malloc free a simple allocation in the stack will do

6498134
prepare	execute
tcl s quite thoroughly embeddable as long as you remember to call tcl_findexecutable before tcl_createinterp so you could do it that way using a small amount of python code to prepare tcl scripts that you execute in the same process

6498146
appkit	nscell	appkit	nsprogressindicator	nsprogressindicator	nscell
the best thing to do would be to use an nscell version of nsprogressindicator but appkit doesn t have such a thing

6498458
rss	feed
i m trying to write a simple rss feed reader in c# using the xmlreader class

6498463
put	get
if i put a description in a box with a fixed maximum width it will wrap correctly but i can t get relative widths to work correctly using css

6498467
bytearrayinputstream	bufferedimage
it occurred to me that a much simpler solution would be to write the bufferedimage out to bytearrayoutputstream and then read it back into a swt image with bytearrayinputstream

6498532
inherited	properties
i m having an odd issue with ef 4.1 code first where even though i have configured an entity to generate columns for its inherited properties it still joins to the inherited type s table

6498591
versioning	upgrade
when your key s validity period expires users will no longer be able to seamlessly upgrade to new versioning of your application. it seems that users will still be able to run your app but not upgrade when the key expires

post	get
i guess http get or post and sax xml parser can be used without soap

6498663
getter	setter
everything is done through getter and setter

6498663

in my application i am reading rss feed and saving them to a core data db using the url of each specific article as the key

6498788
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and google-chrome this works but in firefox event.stoppropagation gives me a null pointer which makes sense because i m not taking in an event parameter into edititem this

6498800
free	strdup
check the return value of strdup for null and free those pointers when you are done with them

6498803
int	chars
try to use a fixed-length key - int bigint chars x for x 6 chars - those tend to be easier to deal with and give sql server less overhead to work with

6498819
udp	tcp
that can for instance happen through wcf see the according sample on codeplex or a tcp udp approach

6498821

whenever you click and drag though the div move at lightning speed

6498855
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the footer looks good in ie firefox safari google-chrome but when i look on to a pc it appears that the font is rendering differently and pushing information into the social icons i have placed

6498871
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if your current controller is already a part of uinavigationcontroller hierarchy then you must not create a new navigation controller - use the existing one instead note that every uiviewcontroller has a reference to its parent uinavigationviewcontroller if it exists

6498884
division	multiplication
if multiplication are o n 2 this is slower than long division for large numbers o n 2 vs o n 2 log n

6498884
division	multiplication
note that if you have a better multiplication algorithm then newton s method outperforms long division asymptotically

6498992
rss	feed
i m trying to write an app in tornado that upon receiving a post request containing a category will call a function that will make blocking http requests to a list of rss feed held in a couchdb database with that topic then perform some sorting on the data returning a dictionary to the tornado async request handler

6499020
versioning	upgrade
i am wondering how the upgrade process should go to get to versioning 1.5.1 of the gae sdk

6499058
inherited	properties
in simple apps if all i want to do is augment a domain model my view model will directly inherited from the domain model and add the extra properties i want to display

6499058
inherited	properties
you could get away with this if you write the mapping layer for this model yourself to take into account the privileges of the accessing user but that is probably more overhead than just creating a second admin model that inherited from the regular view model and augments it with the admin properties

6499092
accelerometer	gyroscope
i am recording sensor data such as accelerometer orientation gyroscope

6499092
wakelock	powermanager

ubuntu	linux
btw i will be porting to linux ubuntu to but will be using notify-osd there which is exactly what i need

from this page i am using ajax to post to a secure url the json response i get back is correct however when i refresh the page the user is not logged in

6499264

i don t know whether python is a good choice or not and which gui library wxpython or pyqt is suitable for that

6499512
onclick	onmousedown
if clicking on this text that is not a link causes something to happen then it is likely that there is an container element that encapsulates the text which is wired to execute some specific javascript when a particular event like onmousedown or onclick is detected

6499549
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
a very reliable way to center an absolutely positioned element is to set its position from the left or top to 50 and then its margin to -half the width or height of the object

6499560
margin	text-align
i ve tried text-align float margin padding and position properties but none of them seem to solve this

6499596
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
if you re one for reading then check out the uiresponder class reference and in particular touchesbegan and touchesmoved

6499606
width	height
the values are not related to the layout_weight just the pre-defined constants for width and height in android

6499614
put	get
this should get rid of the extra space on the left as well as put that blue border around the drop-down that i believe you were also trying to create

6499625
post	get
consider this the models don t really know about post get and whatnot

6499661
int	boolean
primitive types int float boolean etc. work distinctly such as you describe in your example

6499723
google-chrome	firefox
the following chokes for about 20s in firefox on my machine about 6s in google-chrome

6499737
portrait	landscape
the issue seems to have been that the app thought it was in portrait mode even though i had the .xib in landscape mode

6499751
background-image	background-position
i ve tried using the full long hand background properties background-image background repeat background-position and i ve tried the x y version background-position-x background-position-y etc

6499833
hide	show
in the callback i check which one is actually set and then show hide a div

6499839

to do this i am currently using a for-loop with isinstance with the number of loops being #nests - 1

6499880
accelerometer	gyroscope
i would like to detect gestures on an ios device using the accelerometer and perhaps the gyroscope

6499919
google-chrome	safari
meanwhile you can use a dirty google-chrome safari hack to add some fixes to your css

6499941
implements	extends
i have a situation where i would like to create javascript objects that extends an abstract java class much like you can use invocable.getinterface to make javascript objects that implements java interfaces

6499966

it is either available directly in webkit google-chrome safari or via firebug for firefox don t know about ie or opera sorry

6500140
int	double
thus .net can provide interlocked.exchange functions for floats and double by pretending that they are int and long int respectively

6500156
width	height
to get the the scale factor of the main image i could retrieve its measuredwidth and measuredheight and set this into relation of the original width and height of the view

6500178
put	get
also to make the mime type problem go away in php put this code in before any echo or prints get done

6500230
portrait	landscape
if you hardcode the width to make it look right in portrait mode for example it won t take advantage of the extra space in landscape mode

6500281
maven	cobertura
great tool but because of the way maven works the cobertura plugin has to run all the phases from resources to compilation again

6500281
maven	cobertura
i once shaved 40 off the during of a long maven build by writing a plugin to stop tests being run until they where being run by the cobertura phase

6500281
ant	maven
i d suggest trialing grandle as it fixes a lot of the issues that both ant and maven have

6500291
ubuntu	linux

mef	prism
i am currently try to integrate mef and prism to work with each other

6502115
free	realloc
whether the realloc will free the 20 bytes or not again completely depends on the os library implementing that realloc

6502121
free	realloc
if the size given to realloc is 0 together with an allocated pointer then it will free the memory the pointer points to and will return null

6502144
int	chars
i think returning -1 is error prone because you do a casting to int and moreover 255 is also a valid chars

6502153
free	realloc
so if your implementation is one of those that doesn t return null for a zero-size allocation and it requires some housekeeping information for each allocation and the memory arena is so full that you can t store even another housekeeping header and it s not smart enough just to split the current allocation and return most of it to the arena it may fail a zero-size realloc and hence not free the original memory

6502290
boost	stl
the stl has an auto_ptr but that cannot be used in a standard container.boost smart pointers would be a best solution but as you already said you can t use boost so in your case you can use your compiler s implementation of smart pointers which comes in tr1 namespace remember though that there is some disagreement on the namespace for tr1 functions visual c++ puts them in std while gcc puts them in std tr1

6502291
google-chrome	firefox
you may be able to use resize none but there are extensions for firefox google-chrome and grease monkey that will bypass that anyway

6502307
free	realloc
so if realloc returns null then the new object could not be allocated and the old object must not be free

6502307
free	realloc
but if realloc returns non-null then you still have the object that must be free or some new memory object that must be free

6502307
free	realloc
implementations do free the block when realloc ptr 0 is called regardless of what c99 might have to say about it

free	malloc	int	chars
already free is only one of the cases other include address not allocated by malloc the data is not actually an address some int or chars string casted to pointer data corruption etc

6504960
free	malloc
if you are interested in the already free case only you could try to track every memory allocation and deallocation by using a custom malloc and free wrapper but this would probably only make your code more complicated and even more error-prone

rss	feed
gmail offers rss feed for inboxes

6505243
children	parent
with this there is no need for the absolutely positioned children to have a z-index at all as those divs now take their z level from their relatively positioned parent - ie and the stack can be quite confusing

6505254
hide	show
there two options show and hide for that i wrote this condition

6505260
tstringgrid	tcxgrid
you could think about a tstringgridtocxgrid facade class which replaces the tstringgrid and translates your legacy code to tcxgrid

6505275
hash	md5
there are documented problems with the nsstring built-in hash method so if you do not want to rely on it you can use the md5 hash instead

width	height
assuming that the resulting cube is axis-aligned and that width corresponds to the x-axis height to the y-axis and depth to the z-axis

6505387
width	height
you could try replacing the ready call with a load call or supplying width and height attributes in your img tags so that their size is known before the images are loaded

6505392
portrait	landscape
they are in a good position when the uiview is in portrait mode but the positioning on the uiimageview s and uilabel s are messed up when the uiview becomes landscape mode

6505419
hide	show
one solution would be to hide any flickering content with css and then show it as necessary with the javascript

6505440
portrait	landscape
you can do.just apply transform to convert their x y coordinate from landscape to portrait etc

6505456
express	node.js

you may need to cast your clob to xmltype before passing to the proc using sys.xmltype.createxml

6505652
google-chrome	firefox
i have designed a navigation menu it working properly on google-chrome firefox and ie8

the webimage class has properties that expose the height and width of the image in pixels

6505974
switching	screens
it works beautifully for smaller amounts of objects but if you plan on having more than 200 objects on the screens you will want to switching to faster mathematical methods

6505993

6506078
google-chrome	firefox
i have a firefox addon that first displays a warning info page telling the user they are being redirected google-chrome localfilter content wait_page.html then redirects them to their destination

6506151
pull	push
if you re instead are using one public master repo that everyone pull and pushes to this would be a even worse idea since when the push inevitably will fail sometime they are trained not to use commit then push but use your ci alias to commit and push changes

6506164
min	max
try to use jwindow instead of jframe because in jwindow you don t have min max and close buttons

6506194
ubuntu	opensuse
i have tried ubuntu and opensuse

6506200
inherited	properties
hard coding properties name in attributes is not bad except functions etc.i suggest you to implement new class inherited from compareattribute so most of above code will gone and your hard coding depency problem will be solved

6506231
width	height
iirc you will get an outofmemoryexception if you try to use a lineargradientbrush to fill a rectangle whose width or height is zero

6506231
width	height
just add an if statement to your drawing code and don t fill the rectangle if the width or height is zero

6506283
width	height	post	get
combined with this post about calculating the size of the resulting text should get you on your way to calculating the text width and with knowledge of the text height the number of lines

rspec	capybara
im using rspec capybara with selenium as webdriver

6506411
post	get
manager is a subclass of field - that s why it s returned as a field by the gridfieldmanager from what i can decipher in your post you re attempting to get around the fact that you can t assign a change listener to a manager.

6506428
implements	extends
note that you can only extends one class while you can implements multiple interfaces

6506471
implements	extends
you will use an abstract class if you want to provide a partial implementation for the subclasses to extends and an interface if you only want to provide signatures of methods that must be implements

6506471
subclass	abstract-class	implements	extends
there is however one limitation of abstract-class in a subclass you can only extends one abstract-class but you may implements as many interfaces as you like in a single class

6506483
postgresql	mysql
for dbmses that support transactions oracle sql server postgresql mysql to some extent ... here s a different approach

get data from web service async and put data into coredata

6506629
inherited	subclassing
an abstract-class is more restrictive when it comes to inherited only one can father a subclassing but you can implement methods and constructors in it

6506641
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade my app make it versioning 1.6 to the new versioning but would like to test that data is not lost during upgrade

6506672

use abstract-class if you want to define some functionality in superclass and to define prototype of some methods that must be override in child classes extends the functionality of a class

6506718
folder	directory
within that folder there should be a bin directory and within there is passenger-install-apache2-module

6506723
subtraction	addition
the subtraction addition simply converts a into the number 10 b into 11 etc

6506730
button	checkbox
rather than using css javascript to change the background of the checkbox which will have issues cross-browser as town has pointed out i would recommend using the asp.net ajax control toolkit s toggle button control

6506733

try giving the virtual directory path create a virtual directory for the image folder

6506739
paredit	slime
however after opening elpa and installing clojure-mode slime and paredit

6506894
gtk	ttk
there are partial ttk themes that delegate to gtk and qt available this presentation from last year shows them in action but they re partial in large part because of the poor quality of the themes gtk qt themes not ttk themes

6506930
apache	nginx
first i thought it was the plugin but it works locally on two different machines mac os x and we ve updated all packages on the vps debian apache nginx php to the latest versions

6506962
hash	md5
md5 is one way hash

6506988
put	get
if you look in the projects json you see that i put a tasks array with ids in it -- thats how the internals know which tasks to get

6506988
children	parent
so to answer your first question you dont need the id from child to parent you need the parent to load with all the children so the json does not match the fixtures exactly

6507032
stdout	stderr
since you say that i m still seeing all my virtual hosts listed i suspect you need to redirect stderr to stdout as seen below assuming bash out.py is just a pythonscript that writes some output to stderr using sys.stderr.write

6507032
stdout	stderr
now send stderr to stdout

6507035
hash	md5
if you re hashing e.g with md5 the value you can compare hash values of id e.g

6507038
deselect	multi-select
to deselect everything in a multi-select

6507057
children	parent
and assign this class to parent s children using jquery or manually like this

6507067

on each of these archived pages i d like to display not only the archived post but also the 10 post that were published before it so that people can get a better sense of what sort of content the blog offers

6507118
cldc	midp
it supports java midlets java midp and cldc technology which provide location communication messaging media and graphics capabilities

6507164
post	get
you ll need to use post then not get if you do not want it displayed

6507220
move	drag
show the map tiles in a div the container when user drag move the container new map tiles in fact they are images will be downloaded

6507220
move	drag
so once user drag or move the container we will download 5 times amount of images than before

6507367
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also google-chrome and safari seem the make another mistake as firefox ie9 and opera

6507505
inherited	properties
i have base class and two inherited classes these two inherited classes also share the two properties

6507526
listview	gridview
if you don t want to add your own insert-functionality its easier to use a listview instead of a gridview

6507574
base-class	subclassing
it does seem a little unusual though not to push this down to the base-class if it is a mandate of all subclassing

6507600
subtract	add
since prefixing characters in roman numerals can sometimes mean subtract this value as opposed to add this value

6507608
google-chrome	firefox
this issue is only in google-chrome it works fine in firefox and ie

6507612
uipangesturerecognizer	uipinchgesturerecognizer
if you need the annotation to move more smoothly you can add a uipangesturerecognizer and uipinchgesturerecognizer to the map view and also update the annotation in the gesture handler

6507630
firefox	safari
in the very near future new versions of firefox and safari will start to support the data attributes but given that there s a perfectly good way of accessessing it that works in all browsers then there s really no reason to be using the html5 method that will only work for some of your visitors

6507719
onclientclick	scriptmanager
two important things to note here the scriptmanager has and the asp button has an onclientclick attribute specified

6507779
hide	show
so you need to think your site structures what is very important and what is not to show some part of the pages hide some other if the user is not register and that way google have something to index even if its not loged in

6507827
maven	m2e
you could uninstall m2e and use the eclipse eclipse plugin for maven instead

6507855
instances	transient
org.hibernate.transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing form.district

6507902
width	height
you ll need to offset by half the width height of the circle

6507906
margin	height
you need to take the witdth and height into conserderation when you re setting the margin

6507931
min	max
my foxpro program has a quit button and the usual min max x buttons in the top right and when using either the program disappears and seems to have closed properly

6507934
post	get
i do plan to cover sub-commands but it ll be a while before i get to it it ll be one of the last post

6507938
fontfamily	font-size
ok you might want to modify fonts as in fontfamily or font-size but not much more than that

6507942
folder	directory
.net 4 has it s own assembly folder c windows microsoft.net assembly which has a gac_32 and gac_64 directory within.

6507943
instances	transient
if you want district to be null it should be actually null rather than pointing to the new transient instances

6507953
express	node.js
in node.js i will be using the express framework

6507953
postgresql	mysql
i m used to postgresql and mysql with django but what i m needing here is some simple data storage etc

6507964
gridview	rowdatabound
i know for a fact that there is sufficient data being returned the datatable fills with all of the records and the gridview shows all the records fine when not touching the rowdatabound event

6507964
gridview	rowdatabound
i have also determined that when handling rowdatabound the gridview s databound event never gets fired

6507975
implements	extends
ive read about implements vs extends behavior and things like that but im not quite experienced in oop to deal with that and find the best solution

6508012
width	height
you have statically assigned height and width to iframe and if that is taller than the contact form then it will fill the entire td cell and the contact form will move to the bottom as the default behavior for td is vertical-align bottom

6508034
nhibernate	queryover
it seems as if nhibernate uses the name of the variables in the queryover expressions somehow in its code

6508085
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout events may act buggy in many browsers because they trigger when leaving elements inside the element that has the handler

6508085
mouseleave	mouseenter
the jquery mouseenter and mouseleave events fix this see demo at bottom of page

6508101
mouseover	mouseout
your mouseover and mouseout events are defined on the same id #gallery which means when you hover over the #gallery the mouseover function will be called but because your overlay is now covering the #gallery your mouse is no longer over the #gallery but it s over the #thumbnails thereby triggering mouseout

6508155
google-chrome	firefox
in ie8 firefox and google-chrome this works perfectly fine

6508178
textview	simplecursoradapter
i did the same by creating a new textview in the listview and mapping the string value using simplecursoradapter

6508187
implements	extends
the syntax is the same for extends classes and implements interfaces

6508211
rss	feed
im using domdocuments to download an rss feed into my php script simple by

2 the password is being hash by a hash function and a key with concatenated salt jquery

6508275
hide	show
i m attempting a hide show toggling script using jquery

6508275

the name of the label is passed into the jquery script and the id of the information is used to trigger a hide show

6508326
client-side	server-side
one side is of the opinion that the entire application could be built using html and a js library all client-side the other side is of the opinion that the application should use a server-side mobile web framework such as rails or similar

6508331
tostring	string.format
in that case you d simply tostring both of them if you ve overridden that method or use the key value in some string.format operation

6508339
post	put
the scenario you ve made a superb script where users can vote for images but you haven t put a failsafe on the post meaning that some users end up finding a way to vote multiple times for an image in one go by refreshing their browser

6508346
hide	show
just use javascript to dynamically hide show the inline set

6508356
zoo	xts
i recommend xts zoo

6508367
implements	extends
i have tried implements runnable instead of extends thread but it still gives anr

6508367
implements	extends
should i implements runnable or extends thread in a significantly different way

6508404
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
we have this solution working in ie and firefox browsers which you can demo below but should you click the demo links using google-chrome or safari the content will constantly loop the template in the iframe source which is where i need your help for a solution to resolve the google-chrome safari issue

6508404
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as mentioned above the solution works in ie firefox but not google-chrome and safari

6508497
jobs	cron
a normal approach to cron jobs with a django site would be to use cron to run custom management commands periodically

6508547
put	get
however when put online i get a java.security.accesscontrolexception access denied exception

6508572
width	height
if i change the width and height of option nothing changes

i m loading essentially the same thing pictures from core data in viewdidload and viewwillappear

6508686
hide	show
when user click on editing any row of the gridview rowcommand event i just want to hide this grid trmyposts and show trnewpost

6508689
hex	binary
then 1 would read in binary as 00000001 and the result would be 11111110 again in binary which is the same as 254 in decimal and 0xfe in hex

6508788
mvp	presenter
in clean mvp view state is kept in the view and not in the presenter

6508810
children	parent
i think the problem is that the parent container won t be able to figure out the height the list should have because there are two children so fit doesn t really have a meaning

6508810
children	parent
if you change the parent s layout from a fit to a vbox give the toppanel a fixed height and the list a flex of 1 the two children should fill the screen

6508823
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the following reduced test case works in google-chrome and firefox but not in opera tested on 11.50 alpha and latest stable both on mac

6508829
versioning	upgrade
i m working for my sins on a flex 3.3 project which unfortunately cannot be upgrade to a newer sdk versioning at this stage and have hit an issue with the custom hierarchical tree class subclassing mx.controls.tree we re using

6508846
sorting	grouping
i have a sub that should be re-ordering a grouping of records but the query at the heart of it is not grouping and sorting the records as expected under rare specific circumstances

6508914
oncreate	onstart
and then i use a service to first register the receiver in oncreate and then handle the events in onstart

6509028
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
that works and is consistent between google-chrome firefox opera ie9 8

6509056
post	put
define a shortcode to create something like adsense you can put in a post

6509088
listview	gridview
this works for all the items in my adapter-fed gridview although it s turning out to be impossible to then properly adding a contextmenu to the gridview itself which registers longclicks on the empty gridview items but that s another story altogether and i d imagine a listview to work the same

6509095
setinterval	settimeout
also it looks like you want setinterval instead of settimeout and you re not adding the cornerimgfocus class to the next slide when the timer ticks

6509167
children	parent
fi merge from parent to children often

6509179
for-loop	loops
you could solve this problem recursively using a queue of vectors where you have a function with a for-loop that loops over the number of n balls placing each of the n balls in a single box of the m boxes that is represented by a vector of size m

6509228
move	drag
the main thing i am looking for is a way of displaying an image in which the user can pinch to zoom drag to move and click on overlays

6509304
children	parent
right now my code only gets the parent but not the children though

6509363
post	get
1 change post to get or

6509371
pop-up	dialog
the main difference is to use a docked cell instead of a pop-up dialog

6509371
post	get
i know that titles get edited sometimes so this trigger as a new post in that case

6509396
fastboot	adb
the program itself executes adb and fastboot commands from the android sdk

6509411
actionscript	mxml
however classa is written as mxml not actionscript code

6509430
width	height
when the android camera opens it fills up the screen in width and height but actually i want the app to open and limit upto certain dimensions on the screen aka barcode scanner but here the catch is that the image taken should limit the boundary of the rectangle that the app shows on its surface

6509433
rel	attr
i thought i could just remove the attr href and rel from the anchour and add them again when i want it enabled but it still works even after i remove the href and rel

6509439
jar	war
however if your deployment package is an ear you need to have an application.xml where you will specify that you have a war or jar as module inside

6509449
memcpy	strncpy
i don t see any practical difference between strncpy and memcpy

6509475
memcpy	strncpy
so memcpy would always copy all the data but strncpy would often be faster because of the check

6509479
memcpy	strncpy
so if the string to be copied is shorter than the limit strncpy pads with zero while memcpy reads beyond the limit possibly invoking undefined behaviour

6509485
memcpy	strncpy
no strncpy is not a specialization since it will detect a 0 character during the copy and stop something memcpy will not do

6509488
getter	setter
note that this method is both a getter and a setter

6509502
width	height
yuvimage preview new yuvimage data imageformat.nv21 width height null

6509502
width	height
preview.compresstojpeg new rect 0 0 width height 100 mjpegoutput

6509502
width	height
imageutil.decodeyuv420sp data width height

6509504
width	height
so at the moment your image plane is 2 width x 2 height and your triangle occupies only a pixel actually even less due to perspective distortion

6509527
int	chars
that is i can copy a 4 byte int to 4 consecutive chars of 1 byte like this

6509527
memcpy	strncpy
another difference is that memcpy does not look ofr any characters such as null by strncpy

6509529
post	get
one common pattern is post redirect get

6509529
post	get
your question is more about design than technology so gwt doesn t really change the picture except to note that the gwt history mechanism is intended to mimic the behavior of static pages connected by links which the post redirect get pattern does also

6509539
memcpy	strncpy
when using memcpy the source and destination buffers can overlap while in strncpy this must not happen

6509539
memcpy	strncpy
according to the c standard the behavior for overlapping buffers are undefined for both strncpy and memcpy

6509539
memcpy	strncpy
according to the c standard the real difference between strncpy and memcpy is that if the source string is less then n value then null characters are appended to the remaining n quantity

6509545
versioning	upgrade
it s a substantial upgrade from the versioning that ships with the jvm

6509549
.htaccess	httpd.conf
my httpd.conf is empty and i don t have .htaccess

6509622
urllib	httplib
some have multiple python urllib urllib2 httplib

6509643
fastboot	adb
since adb and fastboot are just small executables you could include them with your project rather than depending on a separate install

6509671
mouseleave	mouseenter
1.6 fails to work as the mouseleave event is fired when leaving the child element trigger bug details are here and edge fires the mouseenter event for trigger each time

6509704
vbo	normals
the indices i give to gldrawelements to render the mesh are used i suppose by opengl to get vertices in the vertex vbo and to get normals in the normals vbo

6509771
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend using google-chrome or firefox for admin work especially adding editing products

6509776
portrait	landscape
currently everything looks great in landscape on some pages but if you change the device to portrait the whole site gets zoomed in

6509793
inherited	properties
one is abstract which provide the persistence properties to inherited classes

6509856
put	get
or pyramid gently forces us to put every code which requires deployment settings in views callables which can get settings dictionary anytime through request.registry.settings

6509856
put	get
those logics are usually put in one or more python modules that may be other than app init .py or app views.py that can easily get access to config or registry

6509913
rsa	aes
depending on the size of the data you want to encrypt you may have to envelope the data with aes then use the rsa keys to encrypt the aes key

6509921
int	boolean
method.invokenative object object class class class int boolean line not available native method

6509929
getter	setter
and setter would just assign to one of those and getter would return value of just one

6509957
folder	directory
i want to strip the base directory of the unpacked dependency have my own base directory at the top and exclude some of the folder e

6509974
min	max
no joining to itself the obvious solution of getting the min and max in one query and then joining to those dates to get the values

getter	setter
i say maybe because just because c# doesn t let you treat a getter or setter like a real method it doesn t mean that some other .net language can t

6512071
serializable	deserialization
the code and json you posted serializable and deserializes as expected for me without any custom deserialization

6512085

serializable deserialization does not magically make the same object instance accessible in multiple jvms but it just creates new object instances which are copies of each other

in width but not in height

6512154
post	get
my blog post shows you how to get changesets programmatically from tfs

i ve got googletest and gmock compiled linked and successfully working

6512772
serializable	deserialization

6512791
post	get
i am having a problem where the ajax post doesn t even get triggered when ie is launched by waitn

6512802

6513314
affinity	processors	cpu	processors	cpu	affinity
setting processors affinity to some specifically-selected arbitrary cpu core doesn t seem like a good idea if that core happens to be busy there s no reason all threads shouldn t be able to migrate to some other core provided there s a full cache flush first

6513316
for-loop	loops
a for-loop should be used when you know the range of your loops in advance for

6513316
for-loop	loops
but then there s the other line of thought that uses only one kind of loops and at that the for-loop because it s more versatile

6513352
cpu	processors
even locked operations are relatively cheap on modern processors - the cpu simply obtains a lock on the cache line when it begins the read part of the operation which it has to have on any write anyway and refuses to release the lock until the locked operation is complete

6513365
pull	push
this is how every push and pull will behave from now on

6513365
pull	push
you push and immediately you can pull the same changesets back with new hashes in a parallel branch to yours

6513365
pull	push
you fix a bug and you re not yet ready to push everything to the server so you allow me to pull from you and now i have outgoing changesets with your name on it and a server that will enforce my name on them all

6513373
rss	feed
there is an app that displays news from the rss feed

6513398
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome opera has a slightly different line-height issue and even ie all render submit buttons without adding any extra space

6513410

changing the height and width barely helps too

6513442
put	get
view controllers often get retained by other view controllers when you push them onto a navigation stack or put them in tabs

6513457
getter	setter
rather than using a has_many association which adds a bunch of setter methods as well as getter simply define a method which you ve more or less already done

6513475
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m developing an npapi plugin for mac and it works and registers properly in both firefox and safari but not with google-chrome

6513475
firefox	safari
the info.plist for the plugin is adequate enough for firefox and safari to acknowledge that it exists in their own plugin listings

6513478
submit	submission
i ve tried adding the simplemodal-close class to the submit button but then it simply closes the modal without submission the form

6513481
width	height
i believe that the view.getleft and view.gettop functions offset by the screen width and height can be used to specify a rect that can be virtually moved around within the constraints of the world and block further deltas from being argued to the view.scrollby method

6513484
loops	while-loop
some prefer to use a while-loop when you do not know when loops will terminate

6513488
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i d guess your trouble here comes from incorrect use of uiviewcontroller and uitabbarcontroller

6513504

it guarantees that throughout the execution of the getter setter code from another thread won t affect the consistency of the result

6513524
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
in the above mentioned question there is quote from msdn saying that sortedlist is based on a tree and sorteddictionary has similar object model but different complexity

6513533
google-chrome	firefox
there are some small syntax errors that caused some errors if you are using firefox you should try taking a look into using either the built in javascript error console for firefox or firebug or if you use google-chrome the built in console and that should help you debug you re script

6513538
multiplying	subtract
adding subtract and multiplying are relatively straight forward

6513580
post	get
but i still don t know how to do it properly or get the post parameters

6513835
voldemort	memcachedb
couchdb hadoop memcachedb voldemort

6513843

surely that didn t come from a swing example but more likely an older awt example

6513854
innodb	myisam
2 the table level locking problems problems updating large datasets in myisam avoidable by using innodb

6513914

the following was taken from another example of how to store a salt password hash

6513918

many shared hosts restrict you to use certain gems

6513927

6513927
children	parent
h must be i s parent i is h left child in case i has no children else h is the next far left child in the tree

6513927
preorder	postorder

today it is said that current browsers catched up with flash but all the html5 canvas samples i have found so far stutter in current firefox and google-chrome browsers

6513944
nscell	nstablecolumn
neither nscell nor nstablecolumn will display tool tips because neither is a subclass of nsview

6513961

to get you on the right track since magento is especially cryptic in this part of itself you should read the inchoo programmatically create order in magento post and by the same author programatically create customer and order in magento with full blown one page checkout

6513965
apache	nginx
i ve tried running with django 1.3 + nginx + apache + mod_wsgi and i m getting 3 as well so it s not a webserver problem but i don t get the 404 error

6513983

fast-forward	merge
i do several commits into feature-x rebase feature-x from master and then do a non fast-forward merge from feature-x branch to the master branch

width	height
you could calculate the width and height using javascript after the page has been rendered then add the box-shadow and set the width height

6514054
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout bubble anytime a child element is hovered over so your fadein method keeps getting called

6514054

change those to mouseenter and mouseleave

6514056
put	get
put this code in a sandbox and you will get

6514080

problem is if you want to detect the shift key itself this triggers a keydown with and a keyup with

6519170
keydown	keyup
i ve tried to attach an event to this combination on keyup but this fail in a very subtle way when both shift keys are pressed for the second shift key you get both keyup keydown with true 16 and then you get another keyup with true 16 when the first shift key is released

6519178
executable	sfx
i have an application that starts an sfx self-extracting executable file and extracts it

mvp	presenter
denis i have been fighting exactly the same problem in an mvp winforms application and the best way we could find to solve the problem reliably was to move to a persistent conversations model rather than session per presenter

6519406
portrait	landscape
my ipad app supports both portrait landscape orientations

6519406
portrait	landscape
changing the frame of all of the children views according the portrait or landscape

6519408

6519422
width	height
set its height and width as fill parent and set its gravity as bottom and put any textview or any button you want in it

6519423
children	parent
the parent sets up the listening socket spawns pre-forks children and each child does a blocking accept

6519426
hash	salt
assuming the salt is unique to each user what you want to do is hash multiple times usually 1000 10000 times

6519515
put	get
so what i have to do is get the event.name for each event_id task_seq combination an put it into task.script

6519533
int	boolean
roughly i require the data to be an int string boolean or other where other datetime is serialized as a string

6519601
ssl	https
also note that using no-store makes very little sense unless the connection is encrypted https ssl

6519681
post	get
in this case i would suggest a web service as you can easily write the business logic rules inside the service and the client will just do a request response process to get post data

6519761

on jquery 1.4.4 works fine but instead to use an older version of jquery i solved using an hidden element in the second container that i will move when i finish to drag the element from the first container

6519871
extjs	smartgwt
you may also use third party libraries with widgets like extjs gwt or smartgwt

6519881
jruby	rubinius
however it ll make yarv rubinius and jruby slower hence the if around the monkeypatch

6519904
try-catch	exception-handling
i m not a big fan of using exception-handling try-catch if logic can be applied so although i could try-catch the ctype i d rather find a way to route it through different code

6519925
google-chrome	firefox
this code for example will work fine with ie but not on firefox or google-chrome

6519960
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome doesn t support any activex objects by default so it is no wonder why you get this error message

6519990
mouse	keyboard
it s a list of items that you can hover over with the mouse or navigate around with the keyboard

6519990
mouse	keyboard
if the mouse is hovering or if the keyboard navigation has the item selected they will both do the same thing set that particular item model to be selected

6519991
google-chrome	safari
you can style it with css3 google-chrome or safari only

6519998

6520001
width	height
i m using the stock embed code that flex provides i tried to edit the css style for the div which i think is #flashcontent and give it a min width and min height but it didnt seem to work actually anything i did to #flashcontent didn t seem to do anything maybe its not the div i need to be adding that attribute to.

6520004
opera	firefox
it looks okay in firefox 4 and opera 11 but doesn t work in ie 7 palemoon etc

6520033
union	distinct
according to an update in the comments union apply a distinct which makes sense now that i think about it

6520052
atoi	strncpy
information about the behaviour of functions is sometimes incorrect atoi fails to mention special cases strncpy or omits vital information iterator invalidation

6520099
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
the mistake i made and i think others might make is thinking there is a direct correlation between setting the gesture s state and the chronology of the standard methods when you subclass a gesture recognizer touchesbegan touchesmoved etc.

6520114
slider	jcarousel
i have a callback which i ve had help on previously which gets the last slider visible on a jcarousel

even though i sometimes only copy the dll assembly from bin directory to iis website folder if the change is only in the code-behind files and the markup images other-content have no changes

6520314
google-chrome	firefox
this is from a php script which solves the problem perfectly with every browser i ve tested firefox since 3.5 ie8+ google-chrome

6520325
put	get
to transfer files you will need to open a channelsftp and issue the right commands call one or more of the put get methods

6520336
ready	each
but if the size of message is say around 1 10th the size of frame then is it that each frame will be now holding 10 messages if 10 messages are ready to be delivered

6520337

i can cache sql result set with memcached or apc but need to know how to do so in case of dynamic sql

6520431
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can do it using httpwebrequest in place of webclient as like below

6520557
int	double
if you want 8 significant digits for your coordinates single precision floats are probably just not enough so your records would have two double precision floats and a 32-bit int which is twenty bytes in total so 60 million records would need 1.2 gb of memory

6520636
implements	extends
create a class extends org.hamcrest.typesafematcher and implements the methods given

i can reprogram the db access layer if needed but i m using sqls and not oo getter and setter methods

6520718

i tried to use following code to get screen width and height in android app development

6520718
width	height
how to get screen width and height then

6520721

i ve previously thought min max should display same results when there is only one record in the given group

6520721

the result for month_2 and month_4 is 0 0 for min 2 5 for max a clarification for this behavior would be appreciated

6520756

try with the following code to get width and height of screen

6520790
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tried with firefox google-chrome safari

6520827
min	max
in this case min or max are going to avoid the null value for doing their aggregate whereas if you put 0 the min or max function will take the value

6520861
implements	extends
today this menu is implements as a custom view extends a linear layout also this menu will be expandable and collapsible so the way it is i have to store the menu state through the activities

6520932

6521237
google-chrome	firefox
edit this approach works in google-chrome but not firefox

6521286
hide	show
what i want to achieve is pass the null or some value and then jquery should hide or show the div depending on the value passed for instance something like below

6521305
width	height
one problem i see with this is that if one of the items change height or width i will have to adjust the x and y coordinates of other ui items so maintenance will be a challenge

6521364
draggable	droppable
i made a test page for ui draggable droppable with a simple html table that worked fine in all browsers

6521364
firefox	safari
i applied something similar to an asp.net page but it s not displaying properly in firefox or safari

6521364
draggable	droppable
the draggable and droppable areas are tags that are dynamically generated in a grid view

6521364
firefox	safari
this function still works in firefox and safari however when i drag the column headers i cannot see the moving on the screen it just stays in place even though in firebug i can see it s coordinates changing with my mouse movements

6521507
width	height
i have a text field with a set height and width and that allows word wrapping

6521509

6521564
versioning	upgrade
there are known issues with jquery 1.6 and any versioning of the validation plugin below 1.8 i suggest you upgrade to the latest versioning as i don t see any apparent errors in the code you have provided and as you see it is working fine in the fiddle

6521638
vb.net	vb6
i find a lot of vb6 examples out there and a few c# examples but no concrete solution in vb.net

6521638
put	get
simply put i need to get the next available drive letter in as few lines of code as possible

6521685
spaces	linefeed
it seems like the linux method just using linefeed makes a lot more sense saves spaces and is easier to parse

6521693
put	get
if i print this out directly in php it displays correctly but if i put it into mongodb and call it back i just get ã â ã â ã â ã

6521696
put	get
if you ve got c# code then put it through the developerfusion coverter - that should get you close although you ll probably have to tweak it

6521706
hash	salt
an integrity key would be a server side generated hash of some of the data plus a salt that you would check against on the server on a round trip

6521717
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the page works as expected in firefox safari google-chrome even in ie7+ â but it does not do so in the latest opera

6521717
opera	google-chrome
i even re-wrote it all using tables â that helped for opera but this way i lost dynamic image height functionality in google-chrome which is essential for me

6521743
hash	md5
the best way to do this was by using md5 hash

6521764
rubymine	radrails	phpstorm	rubymine	phpstorm	webstorm
webstorm + pycharm + rubymine + phpstorm though to be fair rubymine has more features than radrails atm

6521791
inherited	subclassing
worse if the referenced method is inherited from a parent and not overridden in the current subclassing the program will die because it doesn t exist in that package

6521830
portrait	landscape
but when i change orientation from portrait to landscape

6521831
width	height
set a max width and height for the div and it should work

6521831
width	height
if it happens that you are forced to support ancient browsers like ie6 you need to use width and height instead of max-width and max-height anyways or it still won t work

6521843
width	height
you need to define a width and height

6521863
post	get
in the high throughput scenario i d start making bucket documents for small groups of post say one per get more page

6521899
google-chrome	firefox
note that in firefox and ie the focus event fires on document load while in google-chrome it only fires if the window had lost focus before and now it has regained it

6521925

for parent and children for example something along these lines is often a better idea

6521979
width	height
what i have been doing is using global constants to set the height width xoffset and yoffsets

6522046
ant	maven
afaik the only tools that jenkins can natively autoconfigure are java jdk ant and maven

6522054
pull	push

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
just tested this craziness in ie8 google-chrome firefox and safari

6522155
int	double
generally in c the lack of a protoype is not an error in itself - if the compiler sees a function call without having seen a prototype it will assume that you re passing the right parameters it will apply default promotions to paramters basically convert things to int ot double as appropriate and will assume the function returns an int

6522190
pull	push
when a user wants to view the spreadsheet i pull out the byte build the workbook and push it to the client ui for editing

the latter is the enterprise way of doing it because it s easy to run mvn clean install war and you can attach the script to an automation engine like hudson bamboo teamcity etc which can then compile test deploy everything something is committed to your source control

6522364
post	get
i d attempt to decouple the page into the independent partials give each one a pair of controller methods get and post and assemble the page by requesting each partial with ajax type calls

6522434
hide	show
i have the following code to show a progress ajax icon and then run a bunch of javascript and then hide the progress icon

i would like the page to fit 100 height width in the browser

6522499

a custom view could just as easily be a uiview uibutton uilabel etc

6523128
width	height
your relative layout must have height and width properties

6523129
screens	tablet
android 3.1 is optimized for tablet while your application will run it may not function visually the same due to it being massively scaled up for a tablet sized screens

6523129
screens	tablet
if you are unsure how it will look then set up the emulator included in the sdk and set it to the screens size resolution of a tablet and see for yourself

6523154
dlsym	dlopen
the other library would be the one loaded by nativeactivity - with android_main and all - and it would use the dlopen dlsym dlclose c api to load run and cleanup the app library

6523155
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
these all work with ie 9 firefox 5 safari 5 and google-chrome 12 on win 7

6523156
width	height
you can try adding the width and or height to the iframe and #outerdiv add overflow-x to the #outerdiv as a failsafe

6523157
post	get
well since this question is composed on how to get the task bar coordinates i ve decided to post another version of how to achieve this by using shappbarmessage function with abm_gettaskbarpos message parameter

6523174
margin	height
i d guess that there s an issue with sizing margin padding or height change in the menu to begin with

6523186
put	get
if you put it down below on the function that can take awhile then you may get a timeout above if the script takes a long time to get to where you called it

you can put the selectedvalue in a hidden field and then you will be able to get it in server side from the hidden field

6523198
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	svg	vml

i then launched my app and looking at process explorer it was loading all my assemblies from the local binaries directory instead of loading the .ni.dll files from the nativeimages_x folder

6523265
superclass	subclassing
for delegating responsibility from a superclass to its subclassing es you might be looking for the template method pattern

6523288
gridview	entitydatasource
i have a simple gridview with an entitydatasource

6523298
subtract	add
if you simply went with then this weird definition of subtractoperation would be legal and you lose the guarantees about what t is in that case - hence the subtract operation can copy itself into an add operation

6523300
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i know it s not much of an answer if your job is a internal corporate intranet one but in the real world most sites redirect ie users and put up a sign saying download a modern secure browser like firefox google-chrome or safari to use this site - to avoid bad press

6523306
hard-drive	floppy
hard-drive partition letter floppy

6523323
put	get
i put breakpoints on the function get showbusycursor calls in httpservice and abstractoperation

6523368
prepare	execute
the problem is that the tools i ve found cannot run in real time it is you need to prepare a script for the deployment phase or even you have to manually execute the tool with your files

6523449
put	get
it s easy to put data in but hard to get data out

6523473
udp	tcp
every ip datagram has a source address and a destination address in the ip header plus a transport protocol number which is for majority of internet traffic is either tcp or udp

i figured out how to build and send get post requests to simulate a click or form submit

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie 9 firefox 5 safari 5 and google-chrome 12 on win 7

6523547
inherited	properties
1 what the code is saying on line 14 is that you want your prod_dept function to inherited the properties and characteristics of the base product function

6523552
width	height
that will let you open a new window of a specified height and width you just need to do something like

6523585
google-chrome	firefox
you should be able to run this on google-chrome or firefox as both have a console accessed by pressing f12 in the browser in which i am outputting the json array

6523609
hide	show
i have an event listener on my mediaplayer to show and hide but it doesn t seem to be working properly

6523623
try-catch	exception-handling
calling get in done method would result in two try-catch blocks as the computational part throws exception-handling so i think this is cleaner in the end

6523661
google-chrome	firefox
i m just trying to understand a difference between ie google-chrome and firefox

6523673
google-chrome	firefox
okay so far this works in google-chrome but not firefox

6523794
width	height
add height and width to the picturebox

6523821
memset	malloc
malloc doesn t initialize the memory it hands back so unless you memset or use some other initialization the values in that memory could be anything and therefore if you re trying to check a pointer assuming it d be null or that an int will be zero you can t make that assumption without initializing the memory first

6523840
superclass	subclassing	uiview	subviews
my guess is that you d have the balloons be subviews of the map s uiimageview then subclassing the uiimageview for the map and implement your own layoutsubviews method layoutsubviews being a method of superclass uiview

6523851
getter	setter
a second question i have in trying to better understand self ivars setter getter is in my legend class why can i just use

bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
svn follows filenames with the meta information contents whereas in git hg and bazaar the contents is follwed with the meta information file name

6523880

i m working on a bit of code that is supposed to trigger a download from a pop-up window that was working in ie7 but broken in ie8 also working in google-chrome and firefox

6524324
pop-up	dialog
both pop-up windows close with no ie download dialog

6524336
post	put
but i added the 2 post ahead of the asynch call which i would believe put something into the run queue ahead of the asynch call

6524408
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that console.log does in fact work in both google-chrome and firefox

6524408
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox you need to have show google-chrome messages and show google-chrome errors enabled in firebug to be able to see messages produced by your greasemonkey script

6524413
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in firefox google-chrome and node.js but fails in ie because of the trailing comma

6524421
getter	setter
another reason that it s generally ungood is that if the setter or getter needs access to the rest of the object then this involves a stored outer object pointer which equates to some inefficiency both memory and time

6524422
folder	directory
i mean the views admin folder is actually website.com admin which is i suppose kind of a virtual directory

6524482
webclient	httpwebrequest
you don t really need a service such as wcf you can do the data transfer manually using primitives such as webclient or httpwebrequest but in this case you ll end up having to deal with bytes on the wire instead of abstractions such as operations proxies and normal clr types

6524508
width	height
so the height width property will always be that of the content within it

6524508
width	height
if you want to get the width height of the content just use the contentheight contentwidth property

6524508
width	height
the height width of swfloader should be the size of the canvas and not it s children

6524592
udp	tcp
also - read more about the protocols tcp udp sockets ethernet the more you read - the better

6524601
filtering	grouping
no in general a having clause is used to filtering the results of your grouping by - for example only reporting those who were paid for more than 24 hours in a day

6524611
filtering	grouping
i would like to check the rowcount of a filtering grouping from without the scope of the grouping

6524611
filtering	grouping
i moved the filtering to the tablix and then i simply used the expression that follows note that there is no data region declaration on the next row in the table after the grouping which was in this instance the details grouping

6524631
profiling	benchmarking
that said you should probably try both and benchmarking profiling to see what happens

6524659
portrait	landscape
here are screen captures of me opening the application rotating to landscape touching the screen to display the video controls then rotating back to portrait to see the corruption

6524677
typedef	struct
i have tried various data structure workarounds such as using struct typedef etc.

6524682
width	height
if the object is dropped close enough to another object combine them into one larger object that has a width equal to the larger of the two and a height equal to both of the objects combined

6524704
put	get
you can have many of these since they get from one queue and put into another queue safely

6524733
cvs	svn
whenever i try to do file-new i only get general and cvs i think you get them when installing regular eclipse i dont get php or svn

6524745
width	border-color
you must css the border-color first and then animate the width

6524761
opera	firefox
ps this code was tested in both opera 11.10 and firefox 4 both with the same result

as the error message clearly says javadoc creates documentation for public or protected classes and methods members that are visible from outside your package

6524862
outputstream	inputstream
if you just want a copy do not make the rookie mistake of using a reader but copy using inputstream outputstream

6524889
put	get
you can put in your web.xml mappedfile set to false like so to get rid of many static lines that aren t neccarrily good blocks to put into an include but they add up to save space

6524891
ubuntu	linux
on osx the error is -5 libusb_error_not_found and on ubuntu linux as root the error is -1 libusb_error_io

6524897

6524925
postgresql	mysql
on the install page i wasn t given an option to use postgresql driver so i assumed i needed to use the mysql or other option

6524957
move	drag
i wonder if there s a way you can configured the flash app object to only get mouse clicks and not mouse drag events thus letting the normal mouse events as you move with the mouse down flow to whatever object is under the mouse event outside of the flash object

6524961
uiview	subviews
right now my solution is to store a uiviewcontroller in my custom uiview set it whenever the uiviewcontroller i m using changes and then adding the uiview as a subviews of the controller

6524974
rvm	bundler
i think from this question that you ve not quite grasped the difference between rvm and bundler and what exactly each does

6524997
for-loop	arrays
the arrays can be iterated though using a typical for-loop starting at 0 and ending at the arrays lenght - 1....the objects inside each arrays element can be iterated through using the for key in object notation

i had to port several shaders to make them work correctly on ati cards it s seems nvidia implementation is a little more permissive regarding bad code i wrote some time

6525045
.htaccess	httpd.conf
to redirect an old domain to a new domain you ll want that rule to be first in your .htaccess or httpd.conf file mdash

6525072
move	drag
the second site has alot of tutorials for things you will need like how to build menu items and buttons and also how to handle user interaction mouse move drag key clicks etc

6525093
post	get
using a post to get the data from the server seems the best approach to not allow the url to be saved

6525179
ati	nvidia
nvidia is more permissive for example nvidia lets you cast wrongly ie float4 to float only making it a warning ati won t error

6525179
ati	nvidia
there is a bigger difference if you use opengl than if you use directx for example i had a quite complex vertex shader matrix palette skinning and even without the slightest warning it didn t work on ati but did on nvidia

6525198
xlsx	xlsm
we released spreadsheetgear for .net 1.0 in 2005 added support for xlsx excel 2007 workbooks in version 4.0 and added support for excel 2010 xlsx and xlsm workbooks in version 6.0 last year

6525245

6525381
children	parent
you want to name the parent and add the child to that instead replacing the existing children

6525440
versioning	upgrade
you need to re-install all your packages when you upgrade a ghc versioning not just wai-handler-devel

ubuntu	linux
answer no it is not - the best way to find it out is to get the very user-friendly linux distribution ubuntu and try it on your own

6525718
mp3	flac
there is a filesystem that converts flac to mp3 behind the scenes

6525718
mp3	flac
so even if the files are actually stored as flac they look like mp3 to the applications

6525737
stdout	stderr
its complicated and the simplest thing is to use utf8 all which will make utf8 the default for your code your files argv stdin stdout and stderr

6525742
versioning	upgrade
but i m hesitant to upgrade what appears to be a significant versioning increase

6525756
profiling	debugging
if you find the chrome-extensions scripts very irritating you can create yourself a developer profiling with no extensions or a minimal set of extensions for debugging your scripts

6525756
profiling	debugging
use this profiling for debugging

6525764
getter	setter
can i use it as setter and getter for the variable

6525780
post	get
you need to add the buttons before the post back so that you can get access to them during the post back probably in the init of the page

6525783
put	get
the stuff i put below is all i could get to work but i m leaving this question open in case someone has something more elegant

6525791
hide	fadeout
fadeout hide the element and you won t be able to hover over it again

6525806
onresume	onpause
i started with onpause and onresume which worked well except when i had an activity that was doing stuff in onactivityresult

6525808
put	get
to get the data back out use the get functions just like the put functions

6525831
onresume	onpause
the android sdk provides the nativeactivity class which is a convenience class that notifies your native code of any activity lifecycle callbacks oncreate onpause onresume etc

6525834
folder	directory
if you just want the .exe file it is located in the bin debug or bin release folder of your project s directory depending on the current configuration setting

6525836
fadein	fadeout
firstly i think your fadeout and fadein are the wrong way around

6525848
bash	zsh
typeset is largely compatible between ksh bash and zsh

6525854
cos	sin
you also have your sin and cos calls the wrong way around in pointat - sin should alter the y axis coordinate not the x axis

6525882
accessor	ivar
you should use the accessor -variable and -setvariable rather than accessing the ivar directly except in -init and -dealloc where you d use _variable

6525885
getter	setter
creates a setter and getter that set get the variable you set it to in this case _variable

6525934

range	max
the max numeric portion range from 1 to 9999 while the letters begin with qa and range from qaa to qad etc

6526029
hide	show
but it doesn t work it just hide everything but then doesn t come back to show the rest

6526034
superclass	subclassing
you ouput the private int x from the subclassing and set the number variable in the superclass

6526043
nexus	artifactory
you should definitly install a repository manager like archiva nexus or artifactory to avoid situations like this

6526055
min	max	minimum	max
this gave me one record per city with the max min values i asked for but those min and max represented individual queries for the minimum latitude maximum latitude etc.

6526055
min	max
what i want to do is search for one record which has the max latitudinal and max longitudinal value then the max latitudinal and min longitudinal value .

6526055
min	max
i tried a few in statements but always resulted in one record which didn t quite represent any of the max or min values

6526061
subtract	add
you would take the sum of the numbers from 1 to 8 which is 36 and subtract it from the sum you get when you add up all the numbers in the array after a position was zero d

6526063
google-chrome	firefox
this page does not hang in google-chrome or firefox but does in ie8 and possibly other ie versions

6526103
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
in css we have a box model to define how border margin padding and fill contribute to the total width and height of a rectangle

6526103
width	height
when i measured the total width and height in photoshop it came out to be 101x101

6526127
post	get
the key here is to remember the order of events when you post a form or click a link and make a get request

6526160
ggplot2	aesthetics
ggplot2 works best if you work with a melted data.frame that contains a different column to specify the different aesthetics

6526170
rss	feed
parsing html with regular expressions is normally seen as a very very bad idea so i d second abizern s suggestion of using the rss feed

6526170
lxml	beautifulsoup
if for some reason you can t do that and have to use the html then as the block has no further structure ruling out something nice like using lxml or beautifulsoup then the following python works for this single example...the regular expression is probably very fragile and frankly cludgey and would need tweaking to handle further examples exceptions

6526219
cruisecontrol	jenkins
otherwise if you need more feedback for your clients you should consider using a real continous integration tool like jenkins hudson cruisecontrol

6526225
typedef	struct
i can t pass a pointer-to-const struct around using the typedef so some functions look like

6526260
post	get
please send an advice about how could i get my facebook wall post info etc

6526276
pull	push
but from then on i could use tortoisehg against github push and pull just fine although pageant needs to be running for authentication to work

6526287
super	self
in your code you are not passing any of the parameters of __init__ to super chef self .__init__ and hence the parameters defined in __init__ are more or less meaningless

6526287
super	self
rem you can take more parameters in the __init__ method then you pass to super chef self .__init__ function

6526290
typedef	struct
just typedef the struct not the pointer

6526306
jar	war
all files in the resources directory get added to your jar or war without being compiled

i prefer objectweb asm and there is also cglib and javassist

6526423
post	get
assuming you get these pieces to work correctly you should post your resulting code

6526424
width	height
alternative inefficient approach store an array of width height lists

6526447
instances	transient
but you would get transient address instances rather than attached adress entities

6526466
put	get
my understanding is that static variables get put in the uninitialized variable section of the binary the bss section and so those are safe to assume as being initialized to 0

6526512
post	get
but if i combine the two with inner join technique i get the same count for post and messages

6526516
profiler	yourkit
this morning i got my hands on a profiler yourkit and started looking for problem spots in my server

6526614
sproutcore	cappuccino
as backbone only enforces the mvc structure of your app unlike frameworks like cappuccino or sproutcore this was a perfect fit for us

6526614
backbone.js	zepto
however it seems like backbone.js is trying to take a library agnostic approach for instance you can use zepto instead of jquery if you like

6526675
map	quadtree
if you are trying to draw a minimal non-rectangular poly around a set of map points you would have to select every point for a city and use a convex hull algorithm or a quadtree of some sort

6526687
rtsp	rtmp
i m trying to convert some h.264 aac rtsp live streams from ip camera to rtmp streams

6526687
xuggle	vlcj
actually i first tried xuggle and vlcj to try to play the rtsp stream natively but jni jna and the package size makes them hard to deploy.

6526783
post	get
using left joins instead of inner joins will also let you get users without any post or without any message

6526785
width	height
followed by its width and height

6526785
width	height
and the width and height are set to the width and height of the window into

since getelementsbytagname returns a htmlcollection changes to the dom are also in your input variable

6527053
hide	show
what i need to do is show or hide certain controls based on what one of my dropdownlists has selected

6527065
udp	tcp
i am interested in deriving a list of active tcp udp network connections on an ios 4.3 device

6527065
udp	tcp
basically i m looking for the same type of information one gets from issuing a netstat -anp tcp or the same but with udp command under os x darwin

6527076
gif	png
everything worked fine until i wanted to render an image jpg gif png with a texture

6527149
gif	png
you could check if the file has jpeg gif png s file signature

6527151
mouse	keyboard
your best bet for long-running ui tests are two machines and a keyboard monitor switch or use terminal services to run the test app in a session of its own so it can have its own view of the world focus mouse keyboard state that won t interfere with the desktop you re working on

6527151
mouse	keyboard
the fundamental issue is that some ui resources - notably the mouse pointer and keyboard focus - are shared among all apps on the desktop

6527186
charindex	substr
set qty ship qty convert int left size charindex x size -1 convert float substr size charindex x size +1 charindex size -charindex x size

6527188
hide	show
i ve devised a workaround to hack a views exposed filter to hide and show products with a stock count of 0

6527189
innodb	myisam
myisam also does table-level locking on insert and update so if you are using myisam for instance for read speed instead of innodb the first approach is also more problematic

6527217
udp	tcp
neither a socket uses a transport protocol but it could be udp tcp or whatever else

6527228
udp	tcp
for #3 the term sockets programming can refer to either udp or tcp

6527237
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my preference is the firebug add-on for firefox but google-chrome safari and even internet explorer all have them built in now

6527274
udp	tcp
serversocket socket is tcp datagramsocket is udp

6527283
hide	show
...and i used the toggle docs method to show or hide based on whether or not any matches were found

6527283
hide	show
0 means hide greater than 0 means show

6527299
udp	tcp
you can decide if you want it to be udp or tcp

6527310
udp	tcp
tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work

6527333
put	get
if you have only put and get get must also remove the element otherwise you won t have access to the nth element for each n

6527333
put	get
for example you can create a adt with put get and pop where get will only return the element

6527337
ubuntu	linux
im compiling with g++ on ubuntu linux

6527356
posixct	read.table
as far as importing csv files read.table s colclasses argument will accept posixlt or posixct as known types

6527363
filtering	grouping
a good grouping to choose to filtering out is the one described by w3c as not suitable for use in markup

6527367
public	protected
it has none of the warm fuzziness of the public private protected hierarchy of member visibility and i ll be the first to admit that it makes me nervous

6527384
gmail	hotmail
as has been stated above you can t force a browser to open an email client-- furthermore many users use gmail hotmail yahoo mail and may use the browser as their client

6527430
cos	sin
implement a user-interface for choosing whether the operand to sin or cos is

6527430
cos	sin
in my sin and cos cases i do the following

6527430
post	put
i realise this is perhaps better suited for math.stackexchange but since there was some code i wanted to post i put it here

6527430
cos	sin
it s been a while since i even worked with cos or sin radians and degrees

6527449
hash	md5
it looks like it could be an md5 hash

6527449
hash	md5
i suggest googling around for hash md5 etc to learn more if you are so inclinded

6527465
hash	md5
while the md5 hash guess suggested by others is quite plausible it could be just about anything.

6527498
range	max
not an answer so much as a workaround having been unable to successfully implement max s solution i copied the emails in the date range to a separate folder and modified my code to act on the new folder

6527502
inherited	properties
inherited will make the min-width properties take the same specified value as the parent s min-width properties

6527537
post	get
imagine the cache update if some post at page 1 get deleted

6527541
children	parent
for example with one database engine the implementation may define foreign keys with cascading deletes and delete the parent object but for another engine it may delete the children of an object separately before deleting the parent

6527547
hash	md5
instead split the cached files into subdirs by some abstract value like the last digit of the thread id or the first two characters of the md5 hash of the thread id

6527597
profiling	instrumentation
it seems that the ants profiling does instrumentation and sampling of code at exactly the same time which i find very interesting

6527603
client-side	server-side
the stack trace you get in this instance from soapfaultbuilder is entirely misleading as it s the stack trace of the code that is creating a client-side representation of the server error rather than the server-side stack trace showing the actual problem

6527636

6527797
width	height
if you are forced to use hard height width values a common way to bind them would be like this

6527797
actualheight	actualwidth
normally if you bind heights and widths you bind to actualheight or actualwidth but those properties do not exist on contentcontrol

6527797
width	height
height and width are only suggested values so you may find that if the above binding is needed and works for you you may need to tweak the values slightly with a value converter to account for margins or padding

6527846
profiling	instrumentation

6527857
oncreate	onnewintent
the problem is onnewintent is only called if the task is already alive forcing me to handle the intent from oncreate too

6528545
getter	setter
if you think your code will never ever use or require any of the above then writing getter and setter by principle is definitely not good practice

by the way coalesce inside of sum is redundant even if capacity is null it won t make the summary null

6530443
aggregate-functions	coalesce
and a coalesce inside an aggregate-functions is a performance killer too as your rdbms engine cannot just rip through all the rows it has to evaluate each row s column if its value is null

openfire	ejabberd
these common xmpp servers like ejabberd and openfire already seem to have inbuilt support for xmpp-over-bosh therefore what added functionality does punjab provide

6532072
openfire	ejabberd
many large sites are using punjab in their xmpp implementation but i couldn t figure out why they would be using it when you could directly have the in-broswe xmpp client connect to ejabberd or openfire

apache	nginx
first replace apache 2 by nginx

6532115
apache	nginx
sadly you will need apache 2 and nginx as reverse proxy to apache 2

6532115

superclass	subclassing
this is working beautifully until i try to present a dialog in the superclass as this behaviour should be exhibited by each subclassing and i get the following error

6532423
int	boolean
so i d suspect that you want to find the difference between false a boolean value indicating a failure and 0 an int indicating that no rows were returned.

6532423
int	boolean
you therefore need to use the operator to check whether you re dealing with the boolean false or the int 0

6534738
mouse	keyboard
the computer does not even have a mouse or keyboard connected to it

6534740
setcontentview	findviewbyid
my solution is setcontentview has to be used with findviewbyid android.r.id.empty but if like me you have two different listview in your activity which need different empty views you will have to find it inside different layout

6534748
highcharts	raphael
if raphael is not a hard requirement you could take a look at highcharts

6534837
int	chars
the unpack compiler pragma comment asks ghc to store the raw unboxed value alongside the tag instead of storing a pointer to the int or chars

6534837
int	chars
your c example has no way to tell whether the value was constructed with an int or a chars while myunion in haskell can tell whether the value was constructed by an i or a c

6534837
int	chars
the c type you wrote is also quite dangerous as if i write to the single byte chars and read the multi-byte int the rest of the bytes in the int are likely undefined

6534849
gridview	objectdatasource
i have used entity framework with objectdatasource for gridview

6534950

6535374
children	parent
it s possible to inflate your own views for both parent and children in it

6535423
int	double
so in summary if you put a literal of type double or long double or some int into a float the compiler will implicitly convert that value if it can be converted exactly

6535587
button	checkbox
or let s say you have some checkbox and realize that the options are mutually exlusive then you can simply morph them to radio button

6535590
inline	inlining
if you really need inlining it s possible to write a script that extracts inline assembly from source files and prepares it in a way that follows the pattern above

6535604
children	parent
the usr1 or graceful signal causes the parent process to advise the children to exit after their current request or to exit immediately if they re not serving anything

6535615
width	height
for example it can put it s new height width there into the parameters

6535615
width	height
this way it can redirect the width and height it received to the mainpage

6535617
inherited	properties
anyway i ll suggest you to model active passive state like a properties in your class rather then use inherited

6535640
mp3	flv
i m trying to convert an mp3 to an flv for use in a custom player we already had built

6535682
hide	show
try using the textbox s enter and leave events to show hide your button

6535781
portrait	landscape
as an aside i believe the iphone specifically rotates photos that it s taken in landscape orientation by setting a flag in the image metadata rather than actually rotating the image data so if you re rotating images taken on an iphone make sure that you test with images taken in both portrait and landscape orientations and check that your image rotation is doing the right thing in each case

6535781
portrait	landscape
if i recall correctly the photo data is always in portrait orientation and just has the landscapeness set in the exif orientation data if the photo was taken with the phone held in landscape orientation

6535793
int	chars
but if that can help you the chars primitive type uses 16-bit unicode chars to store the data and int uses 32-bits

6535843
wxpython	pygtk
i don t think you can mix pygtk with wxpython

no matter where i put this in the oncreate after i get the data i need or in the onstop or ondestroy it will produce this error

6535923

6536181
uiview	subviews
the way i d do it is to separate the right curve of the button as images and make a uiview that has the left part of the button and the right curve as subviews

6536184

doing so would also let your beta users get notified of an application upgrade that is the release of the final versioning

6536336
post	get
after reading this post looking for the same solution as you i found a solution using the .any and .all methods for linq are a nice simple and elegant way to get matching results for arrays

6536346
post	get
instead of saying it is wrong post the compiler errors you are getting and you will get better answers in return

6536351
width	height
and a width and height just to be sure

6536365
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you could put your views inside uiviewcontroller and those uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller then use the uinavigationcontroller handle that for you

6536402
accessor	properties
note that synthesize generates the accessor for your properties it does not initialize the backing instance variable

6536788
maven	m2e
the m2e plugin is fairly intelligent about maven dependencies

6536789
post	get
- the most common reason is it allows you have two actions with the same signature see the get post delete actions of any scaffolded controller

6536835
screens	tablet
even among tablet devices the difference in screens size and screens resolution can require different fonts size and link spacing for legibility of the font and the accurate touchability of the links

6536851
maven	pom.xml
i m not sure if you can point to a directory that has a pom.xml in it but at least you don t have to deploy it into maven

6536852
implements	extends
you then extends that generated code by implements your your customizations manually in another partial class

6536865
helpers	actioncontroller
next create a helpers method on your base controller class that takes an actioncontroller and routevalues as parameters and returns the viewresult for this shared view

6537394
jar	war
in the case that the jar that contains faces beans is already bundled in an ear because it contains ejbs then you also have to put the same jar in the web-inf lib of the war on top of adding the faces-config.xml in the meta-inf directory so that the container recognizes the jsf 2.0 annotations

and therefore it was not able to determine the width height of the image

6537725
width	height
in this case i found a simple solution by hardcoding the height width into the flickr-loader - and the initializing orbit once that was done

6537743
children	parent
it should always work the other way around where the parent manage and keep track of the children

i have a website with an rss feed of news items

6537877
rss	feed
i m ashamed to say that i don t use rss feed much personally so i don t even really know what it implies for one to be updating too often - i can see how it would be annoying if you keep checking an updated feed only to find no new content or even worse if you are receiving continual alerts of non-existent updates

6537877
rss	feed
but as i say i don t have a clear picture of how rss feed consumption generally works

6537877
rss	feed
if it s relevant the rss feed is being generated by standard cakephp helpers for the purpose

6545619
portrait	landscape
in default portrait mode the tabs are located on top of screen but when change to landscape mode the tabs on the top makes the screen looks odd so i would like to locate the tabs on the left side of the screen vertically when the emulator change to landscape mode

goto	break
as a side note the java language designers decided to ban goto completely and introduce a labeled break statement instead

6545740
goto	break
goto is great for breaking out of many loops where break would not work well say upon error conditions and as kragen said goto is used by the compiler to generate switch statements and some other things as well

the same pattern could have possible interpretations string boolean int and so i don t think that that actually even makes sense

6545785
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit	gedit	aptana	gedit	nano

pop-up	dialog
this is happening because you have set up the ddl as target of your modal pop-up extender - so whenever target index is changed the dialog is shown

6546521
pop-up	dialog
the solution is to have an hidden button and make that a target control for modal pop-up extender - if your ddl has auto-postback as true then your server side code will check the selected index and pop-up the dialog

6546521
hide	show
you can also use modal pop-up javascript api to show hide on ddl selected index change w o doing post-back

6546529

6547813
getter	setter
and don t use setter and getter at all

6547829

minimum	max
the sql server is set with a minimum memory seting of 2048mb and a max of 4096mb

6548718
min	max	minimum	max
from my understanding sql server should at the very least grow to the minimum memory level and then stay between the min and max but it s not

6548729
post	get
as i understand it the canvas is a holder for draw requests which get executed when the post is issued

6548748
google-chrome	firefox
which seems to do what i expect in msie6 firefox and google-chrome - the nthrow tr elements below the initial tr are made visible previously style.display none

6548764
min	max
also note that the min max memory levels only affect the buffer pool - memory is used for many other things in sql server though the buffer pool is by far the largest consumer

6548765
udp	tcp
you could write a websocket server to serve as proxy bridge between tcp udp

6548800

i would advise you to look at more modern json libraries like gson or jackson because they make life a lot simpler

6549149
superclass	subclassing
extending the defaults for the subclassing are reflected in the superclass

6549149
superclass	subclassing
this seems to defeat the purpose and i m more apt to explicitly list the superclass defaults in the subclassing to get the structure i m looking for

6549175
imperative	declarative
instead of using declarative cas i would use imperative

6549198
post	get
bob cravens truck trackr is a good series of post to read to get you thinking about it

6549198
ninject	spring.net
if you have to have it like that then consider using a dependency injection framework such as unity or spring.net or ninject

6549218
hide	show
so if you use the sql as i ve written it that will ensure that grname is always populated and so on your asp side logic to show hide controls isn t necessary

6549218
hide	show
of course there are reasons to show hide controls as well - but if you can eliminate unwanted rows from the data being sent to the server that s less traffic overall and as little as necessary and possible is always a goal when it comes to data transmission

6549219
post	get
also i did not post the query because i don t think it is very useful it is just a simple select query and i am sure you get the idea

6549227
google-chrome	firefox
i searched almost everywhere in google-chrome and firefox and i didn t find any place to revoke given permissions

6549235
google-chrome	safari
but google-chrome and safari still have the vert align problem

6549244

if you want to load different resources in landscape and portrait mode like a layout although it could be anything in your res folder then put the pertinent resource files in res layout-land and res layout-port under the same filename

6549244
portrait	landscape
if you want portrait to be your default orientation then put those resources in res layout and put your landscape resources in res layout-land

6549470
kerberos	ntlm
you will see exactly where kerberos digresses to ntlm

6549472

after you do that you need to learn how to make http post and get calls parse your data and insert into your phone database

6549564
cpu	processors
to simply find out the cpu used has a processors field

6549596
ant	pom.xml
even though this is kind of old another alternative with jetty 8 is to simply include the jetty jars as dependencies in your pom.xml and add the following in your pom.xml versus an ant script that unpackages the war and repackages it

versioning	upgrade
stuck with jsf 1.2 cannot upgrade to a higher versioning

6549623
clang	llvm
i have a source c++ code which i parse using clang producing llvm bytecode

6549787
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux but i have xp in a vm if it s windows-only

6549812
inherited	properties
anyway it would be trivial to implement yourself - create a class that inherited from linklabel add a string url properties you may need an attribute to make this show in the designer properties panel if you want to set it that way and provide an event handler that opens the browser with that url

6549854
serializable	deserialization
once you finished implementing the serializable and deserialization function either you can write using operators or functions

6549896
fadein	fadeout	slideup	slidedown
the problem with doing .stop then slideup slidedown or fadein fadeout is that the animation can end prematurely and keep an incorrect height opacity

6549918
fadein	fadeout	slideup	slidedown
the fadein fadeout slideup and slidedown move from the current state to a new one and then revert to that - not to the original css

6550070
getter	setter
it is only if getter setter methods are provided otherwise it is not

6550070
getter	setter
indeed the property synthesize directives are facilities meant to declare and define default getter setter methods

6550070
getter	setter
it is not necessary that every ivar has a property nor that it has getter setter in order to be used inside of that class implementation

6550070
getter	setter
synthesize will provide implementation for getter setter for anotherclassobj so you can use syntax

6550070
getter	setter
when you have no getter setter either auto-generated or custom you can assign directly to an ivar by using the syntax with the semantics of simple pointer copy

6550070
getter	setter
anotherclassobj notwithstanding you can still refer _anotherclassobj directly in your .m file like in bypassing getter setter if you ever need it

6550070
getter	setter
one thing you should have clear is that getter setter are not only a way to make an ivar public

6550072
hive	hdfs
in my case hive stores data in user hive warehouse directory in hdfs

6550076
teamcity	nant
we use teamcity s nant runner to start the test jobs and use nant s task to run the tests under control of nunit

on some sites if you click an image within a post you will get the image in a new page with the images in the post at the bottom

6550219
floating-point	integer
i assume that you are representing your currency using integers and not floating-point so that the currency value â 123.45 is represented by the integer v 12345

6550224
printf	getchar
however if i add a getchar right after the printf i never get anything off the input stream

6550229
fadein	fadeout
the problem is caused by the way fadein fadeout etc

6550229
fadein	fadeout
the way that you would solve this is actually to replace fadein fadeout etc

6550229
slideup	slidedown
a similar thing could be done to replace slideup and slidedown using animate

6550303
stdout	fflush
this can be done in c with fflush stdout

6550550
getter	setter
i m not sure if having a host of private setter and getter methods is the way to go

6550590
width	height
through debugging the width and height of the mapview remain constant except when there s an orientation change except for the initial creation of the mapview where the dimensions width and height are zero

6550618
packets	multicast
i have a prototype android app that is listening for multicast packets to discover clients to communicate with

6550627

6550696
put	get
i wouldn t put all the chat messages in a single collection and then have the session view models filter them - filtering items in a collection is an o n operation and if you re building a chat client n is going to get very big

6550702
inherited	properties
how could i inherited from the style and just change one properties

6550713
udp	tcp
but this has the usual reliability problems of udp and we also need to use message-numbers to relate responses to requests or such - which could mean that we have to re-implement half of tcp again

6550774
puts	gets
i m building a java application that gets its data from an oracle database and puts it into a jtable

6550786
folder	directory
if you re going to have many partials i d recommend you putting them into subdirectories of that folder whatever makes sense to your application since having many partials in one directory is generally not a good practice

6550788
crossover	mutation
then throw out the 50 or some other percentage of nns that were farthest away from the goal do crossover mutation of the top 50 and run the new set of nns again

6550805
switching	screens
using the back button to go back doesn t cause an activity switching animation to happen it just refreshes the screens to the previous page

6550812
put	get
after you get your results back put them in a list and let this be the backing list for your table model

6550834
hex	binary
you can also look at the binary of the app with a hex editor you won t be able to see the source code but it should still give you an idea

6550868
google-chrome	firefox
this is what i ve tried and it works fine in firefox google-chrome and ie8

6550880
width	height
i want from select box if selected 700x7000 then image s size will be height 700px and width 700px

6550923
post	get
one minor downside is that you can t have a foreign key from media to news post so you don t get referential integrity

6550936
width	height
well to change it you can just set the image s width and height

6550945
put	get
i m using an xmlfilter pipeline to get sax events from an xmlreader and i would like to put an xmlfilter stage in the pipeline to dump the result to a file kind of like the tee program in unix

6551478
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie i get this

6551553
kerberos	ntlm
i have found many references to this problem and only one potential solution that to this point i have not been able to determine if we can implement it this is the reference to calling strictly via kerberos and not ntlm which is not as simple as it may appear according to the documentation and my research

6551602
postgresql	mysql
i am using mysql but i might need for another project using postgresql

6551609
width	height
in the example above i defined the height of the containing element .box as 2em and the borders of the contained span elements as 1em making the overall height 2em had i given the span s their own height or width the shape would have become more intricate

6551609
width	height
using both width and height allows for a partially-dissected box

6551620
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome but it seems to have no effect in firefox 3.6.18

6551620
google-chrome	firefox
when i type in or jquery in the firefox console i get an error whereas google-chrome just shows it correctly. the rest of my scripts can t load because of this

6551626
hide	show
you can simply add both the views to your viewcontrollers subview and use the hidden property of the views to show hide the correct view

6551645
opera	google-chrome
it should fade on hover etc but it s just not working tested in moz opera and google-chrome no luck

6551705

6551713
subtract	add
the problem here is that if in my algorithm presented in function trymove i add potentialarea to movelinearea and i am doing detection of change in the spacetestarea which is created from the movelinearea after subtract areas taken by all units i have a collision with a unit that is not even close where moving unit is at and it is moving to

6551741
post	get
this is still posting under my own id though so now i need to go the extra step of figuring out how to get the post to appear to come from the page itself

6551778
bash	zsh
i don t think bourne bash or zsh will let you do that but you could do it in perl using the built-in setpgrp note the slight name difference from posix

6551800
width	height
have you tried to multiply height and width by density

6551850
chron	lubridate
we can use lubridate s year month day or chron s month.day.year

6551850
chron	lubridate	zoo	chron	zoo	lubridate
we can just use aggregate.zoo directly with the original zoo object z using lubridate or chron or just using yearmon from zoo depending on what it is that you want to do

6551850
chron	lubridate	zoo	chron	zoo	lubridate
then we need neither chron nor lubridate but rather can use zoo s yearmon

6551869
screens	tablet
we also have a bug where the tablet becomes unresponsive with the screens off

6551869
screens	tablet
i am pursuing a theory that the unresponsive tablet is a bsod crash that happened with the screens off

6551876
pop-up	dialog
this would then pop-up the usual dialog box from the browser about downloading content etc.

6551887
post	get
i ve a program running to compute this in mathematica with some restrictions and i ll also post it if i get some time to finish it

6551887

6551984
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
1 have a temporary object tempworktime subclassed from nsobject with the same attributes from the worktime nsmanagedobject

6551984
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
i would of course have to subclass them to accept an nsobject instead of a nsmanagedobject

6551989
vmware	virtualbox
modern hardware-assisted desktop virtualization products like vmware workstation or virtualbox normally provide the guest os with a virtual graphics adapter that has a limited functionality

6552003
width	height
svg is inline and inside of a table cell so try adding display block to svg and width height to the so that svg knows what to calculate percentage from

6552045
int	double
this actually produces a double though so you ll need to cast it down if you really want an int

6552074
lisp	smalltalk
but semantically it has more in common with lisp and smalltalk

6552104
pop-up	dialog
i have subclassed dialog in order to display a pop-up

6552132
onresume	onpause
and as counterpart of onpause you should use onresume

6552146
free	malloc
i would expect so lousy performance if each malloc free called virtualalloc virtualfree and if that is the case you have enabled memory debugging somehow somewhere

6552227
robocopy	xcopy
i checked the documentation for both xcopy and robocopy but i couldn t find any parameters that allowed this functionality

6552248
mouseover	mouseout
to ensure that i is the value you want when the mouseover and mouseout events are fired wrap them in a function

6552249
inherited	properties
it looks like trying to apply class object structure in objects where producttype is a class and product is an object that can be an instance producttypes and inherited properties and available values from each of associated product types

6552435
getter	setter
in an attemt to display the image i changed my getter and setter methods to the following

6552442
post	get
i ll gladly post mine for all to use if i could get it to work

6552443
servicebehavior	was
i have some wcf services using datacontracts and i wanted to i was hoping to pass a exception with custom dictionary string object data in the data property but when i add any data on this array before throwing i get the following error in the errorhandler of my custom servicebehavior

6552456
getter	setter
see this post for more details john resig javascript getter and setter

6552513
width	height
to do this i got the intended size from width height viewbox depending on which is available made the viewbox equal the size of the available viewport the containing tag and changed the x y values of the viewbox attribute so that the image appears to be in the center of the viewport and removed width and height attributes if they were present

6552517
min	max
i am searching for code that could find the min and max or first and last values from a column in a datatable

6552517
min	max
i have stored the datatable with four column values i want to find the min and max values from the third column index 2 and display it to the user

6552525
superclass	subclassing
in java a subclassing will either override or hide superclass members fields methods types of the same name

6552562
pci	iommu
an example for iommu is graphics address remapping table gart used by agp and pci express graphics cards

6552562
vmware	virtualbox
products from vmware citrix and virtualbox etc

6552569
folder	directory
i have the following directory c files and i m trying to create a wrapper function which emulates mkdir s functionality except works on more then one folder

6552614
min	max
if you are looking for min max you d need to write a loop such as this

6552619
ssl	https
let s get back to the webservice scenario if you want to invoke a webservice located on a webserver which uses ssl and https there is a problem

6552644
hash	md5
hackers can and have created rainbow tables whereby they hash using md5 sha1 sha256 sha512 etc. a list of the top 1 000 or so most common passwords

6552646
memcpy	memmove
seems like the library code is using memcpy when to be strictly portable it should be using memmove

6552694
int	double
my psychic sense tells me that eyex is declared as an int not as a double as it should be

6552694
floating-point	integer
alternatively if you don t control the definition of eyex et al say because they re part of a structure for a third-party library then what you should instead be doing is printing them out with the d modifier to print them as integers not with f and you should also assign them integer values such as -1000 and 0 not floating-point values such as -1000.0 and 0.0

6552704
hash	salt
they take these values concatenate a random salt to each then hash them

6552704
hash	salt
they record the salt and pass the hash to their opponent

6552704
hash	salt
the opponent concatenates a salt of their own hash again then shuffles the hash and passes the deck back to the original player

6552706
filesystems	ntfs
the windows filesystems ntfs doesn t store any metadata for a file beyond the trivial stuff like name extension last written date etcetera

6552713
org.json	gson
android has the org.json parsing classes built in and there is a separate jsonreader based on gson in android 3.x

6552715
subtraction	add
for instance if you add debug code to your program you ll see that this exclusiveor area only pops up in the 6th subtraction

6552741
disk	ram
mongodb tries to keep the indexes in ram and every io needed to look up an index on disk will slow down your query considerably

6552743
hash	salt
the reason as i found in this article is that you actually need the salt to check an incoming password with the salt and hash one in your database

6552754
width	height
as you can see i m initializing the variables for width height etc

6552770
hash	salt
as said above unique secret salt for each password will prevent anyone from pre-computing the hash in a rainbow table

6552791
nsurl	nsstring
chris when you create the nsurl from the nsstring store that in a local variable and log that

6552794
gtk	gdk
if you want to render gtk with opengl i d start by creating a new gdk backend x11 opengl or something like that that re- implements all the gdk drawing functions using opengl

6552868
websphere	ibm
these are quite a number and i searched them with a little grep and unzip -l magic and figured that the file opt ibm websphere portalserver wcm prereq.wcm wcm shared app jdom.jar contains jdom without the jaxen stuff

6552904
atomic	interlocked
there are special cpu instruction like lock which must be executed together with other instruction like cmpxchg to ensure atomic interlocked ram read write or modify some instructions are atomic by default

6552904
atomic	interlocked
remember the atomic interlocked ram access can be only 1 2 4 or 8 and 16 under 64bit cpu bytes long

6552941
move	drag
in wpf the pod being move does not move while you drag the mouse but the other pods still get out of the way as you drag the mouse around

6552961
int	chars
using printf converts the int into a series of chars in this case 4

6552961
int	chars
using fwrite causes the actual bytes comprising the int value to be written in this case the 4 bytes for the chars w o r and d

6553071
converter	multibinding
so i don t have multibinding converter out of the box and binding to the parameter doesn t work which i think it does in wpf

6553099
google-chrome	firefox
if it s for an intranet and you can control what they ll use firefox or google-chrome or ie9 then yes you don t need to worry that much

6553162
google-chrome	firefox
the user only has ie7 at his disposal and cannot use firefox google-chrome etc

6553192
ssl	https
ssl is really well supported it s used in https afterall

6553232
folder	directory
i want to provide them with folder with tk and tcl .tcl source files that would be located in some directory relative to my app like extras tcl and extras tk

6553267
hash	md5
instead of trying to reconstruct the hash which is a md5 checksum over the method s definition as parsed by doxygen see memberdef setanchor in the code

6553268
addclass	removeclass
it should be as suggested as above addclass and removeclass

6553301
inherited	properties
this properties are part of some interface and the generic param is constraint to inherited from the interface

6553302
redmine	chiliproject
chiliproject a fork of redmine uses bundler you might be able to use that gemfile instead

6553343
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i am using touchesbegan touchesmoved etc

6553363
hash	salt
i think it would be smarter to salt and hash passwords directly on the client s machine

6553373
hide	show
the secret sauce to hide them in conjunction with the show all code is

6553378
google-chrome	firefox
this information is likely available via the extension mechanism of various browsers firefox add-ins google-chrome extensions etc. but that would be only for a browser extension which requires an explicit install from the user and currently requires writing one for each browser vendor where not all vendors offer an extension mechanism

6553416
pop-up	dialog
i have a swing app that has a dialog pop-up and ask for a username and password

6553417
superclass	subclassing
so you ve got a superclass called entity which has subclassing user building and hotel

6553418
getter	setter
i haven t think much on the design but the first simple runtime approach would be refactoring all the existing code so that instead of accessing the fields directly they do so by means of accessors setter and getter and that map the arguments to the storage types

6553429
hash	salt
the trouble with that is that the salt hash password then travels over the network and if anyone intercepts it they can use it

6553429
hash	salt
what might work is if the server sends the salt to be used to the client and the client then sends back the salt hash password using the server-created salt

6553429
hash	salt
and the classic way to do that is to have the server store the salt hash password and the client sends the password to the server which validates what the client sends by salting and hashing the sent password and comparing the result with what it has stored

6553430
qgraphicsview	qwidget
qgraphicsview inherits from from qwidget because it inherits from qabstractscrollarea

6553455
cos	inverse
to get the angles themselves you ll need to use the inverse cos function

6553556
rss	feed
there is a rss feed link

6553562
onresume	onpause
instead you should design your activities to consume free resources in the activity lifecycle methods like onresume onpause onstart onstop etc

6553564
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qgraphicsview reimplements keypressevent and will forward events to the qgraphicsscene

6553564
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
by default the qgraphicsscene will forward that key press to the current qgraphicsitem through its keypressevent function

6553564
qgraphicsitem	qobject	qgraphicsscene	qobject	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
besides implementing qobject installeventfilter you could also subclass any of qgraphicsview qgraphicsscene or qgraphicsitem and override the keypressevent function

6553615
aggregate-functions	sum
sum is an aggregate-functions which only make sense over a group of rows

6553642
width	height
in the above replace scan0 with the pointer to the bitmap data in bytes which i believe in your code is pbitmap and the rest of the information regarding the height width pixelformat etc from the m_format variable

6553656
folder	directory
s3 doesn t have the concept of directory the whole folder file.jpg is the file name

6553657
maven	pom.xml
you could create a dummy pom.xml with the necessary properties and make those calls through the maven plugin

6553657
maven	pom.xml
the pom.xml sitting in your current directory has the correct maven coordinates in its definition

6553678
post	get
check that the form was sent via post and not get

6553736
serializable	deserialization
it s my understanding that the official c# driver can perform serializable and deserialization of pocos

6553746
children	parent
from here a node at position i j has children at i + 1 j and i + 1 j + 1 and parent at position i - 1 j and i - 1 j - 1 assuming those indices are valid

6553855
hash	md5
there are also issues with md5 so depending on your purposes you might want to use a more-secure hash function sha-256

6553883
nswindow	nsscrollview
i have an nsscrollview inside an nswindow but it seems to be disabled

6553944
qwebview	qtextbrowser
qtextbrowser qtextedit and qwebview

6553966
int	double
dates in access jet ace are stored not as the text representation but as a double where the int part is the day since 12 30 1899 and the decimal part is the time

6553968
min	max	range	max	range	min
- as belisarius says you can find the range of area ratios for each of the above situations but simply taking the min and max is incorrect

6553974
inherited	properties
and of course it inherited from an object too that is the internal __proto__ properties

6553974
inherited	properties
an empty object always inherited some default properties but it does not have own properties

6553982
perl	tcl
python perl jruby lua beanshell javascript tcl and shell are currently supported and we re planning to add more.

6553988
inherited	properties
those are methods and properties inherited from the object class

6554024
superclass	subclassing
constructor injection ist not very subclassing friendly as the subclassing constructors will have to redeclare the superclass dependencies

6554043
google-chrome	firefox
instead of firefox or ie i use google-chrome and i superficially feel google-chrome is responding better

6554074
portrait	landscape
i have an app that is in portrait mode but some screens should have a landscape mode for phones with physical keyboards

6554125
onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onkeyup	onmousedown	onkeydown	onkeyup	onmouseup	onkeyup	onkeydown	onkeydown	onmouseup
associate this function to the onkeyup onkeydown and onmouseup and onmousedown to get the location tryit out over here

6554158
octal	decimal
you want to use 777 octal not decimal

6554158
octal	decimal
777 decimal turns out to be 1411 octal which will give you the bitmask 1 100 001 001 which is why you re getting those strange permissions

6554158
umask	mkdir
also keep in mind that mkdir is subject to your umask setting and may not give you the permissions you ask for your umask setting gets removed from the permissions you ask for to give you the actual permissions

6554158
chmod	mkdir	umask	chmod	umask	mkdir
you re better off using mkdir to create the directory then chmod which isn t affected by your umask setting to change the permissions

6554163
glassfish	weblogic
once you re ready to deploy lift apps are packaged as war files and can be deployed on any common servlet container jetty tomcat glassfish weblogic etc.

6554180
umask	mkdir
mkdir is also affected by the current umask see example #1

6554229
accessor	properties
the accessor of a properties contains the executable statements associated with getting reading or computing or setting writing the properties

6554235
put	get	accessor	properties
simply put get and set accessor are the functions called on a properties

6554235
getter	setter
generally speaking you ll only want to compare the hash of a password instead of storing things plaintext so you d have the getter variable retrieve the stored hash and the setter would take the provided input and hash it for storage

6554236
getter	setter
in this case bar is a public property that has a getter and a setter that allows access to the private field _bar that would otherwise be inaccessible beyond class foo

6554240
accessor	properties
properties are language elements that allow you to avoid the repetitive getxyz accessor and setxyz mutators techniques found in other languages like java

6554240
getter	setter
getter setter access modifiers in c#

6554240
getter	setter
multiple getter or setter not in c#

6554245
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i haven t really tested the html css beyond mac os but it works fine on safari firefox and google-chrome

6554247
public	protected
they can each be public protected or private

6554247
accessor	properties
similar to accessor and mutator methods they allow some computation when code tries to access mutate the properties

6554248
accessor	properties
properties act as accessor to the internal state of an object hiding the implementation of that state

one factors i still am ambivalent about with this approach is that adding another searchable attribute would mean adding a new column

6554771
int	chars
what makes no sense to me is that occasionally this supposed resetting of the arrays would cause some or all of the values in keys to become two- or three-digit int therefore always evaluating true and making the player chars move uncontrollably until one or more of the keys that were apparently down were depressed

6557096
opera	google-chrome
opera google-chrome -- key 12 value bb key 23 value aa

6557096
opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome are storing in reverse of creation order because 12 is less than 23 so if you use instead say -

6557096
opera	google-chrome
if the string identifiers are numeric 23 and 12 then opera and google-chrome treat them as numbers and again reverse the creation order so that type are not permitted either

google-chrome	firefox
in the image you can see that where in google-chrome right the button and input field fit perfectly in firefox they ll have a height difference of 1px

because you can t inherit a static class protected serves no purpose - only public and private make sense here

6558366
vpn	lan
if you need to connect two pcs via internet then you can create vpn virtual private network which means the two machines are birtually in the same lan

slideup	slidedown
2 attach slidedown slideup events to that div instead of button

6558432
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
note however that you are bound to run into trouble at run time when you have to convince your installation to use the shared libraries from the right directory especially in case someone decides to upgrade the default versioning on the respective host

6558502
width	height
the probable explanation is that the full calendar can t figure out its height because when initially created that tab is hidden which will make it have zero width and height

6558554
rss	feed
is there any place i could download large rss feed or xml feed i want to test displaying the data in phases and check if the computer freezes up

6558616
pop-up	dialog
i need to render lookup field from a list as a link with pop-up dialog the same way as lookup fields are rendered in default sharepoint 2010 list view

6558697
g++	gcc
g++ gcc 4.1.2 20080704 red hat 4.1.2-48

6558747
portrait	landscape
assuming this point was for rotating from landscape back to portrait

6558747
width	height
and show x 20 y 0 height 480 width

6558747
portrait	landscape
so in the first case portrait to landscape it gives you the rect for the portrait orientation

6558747
portrait	landscape
in the second case landscape to portrait it gives you the rect for the landscape orientation

6558797
width	height
the formular for finding the index of where to place the item is the following when the height of the array is 30 items and the width of the array is 20 items

6558821
alarmmanager	wakelock
and the last major difference that no one mentioned here is that alarmmanager knows about wakelock s and power management

6558835
getter	setter
we first create an instance of the class containing the getter and setter in our case it is a

6558873
division	modulo
you can use division and modulo to do so

6558974
hash	salt
inside the file is a pipe delimited line that contains the date username email salt and a password hash

6558996
opera	safari
as far as i know some versions of safari and opera does that by default

6559010
spaces	delimiter
the solution that i came up with was to put all the bad words in a hashmap and put input string in a stringbuffer and retrieve word by word delimiter by spaces and check if word exists in hashmap if it exists replace the word with empty string

6559106
hash	salt
nobody talks about the salt being hash because the salt can t be hash

6559106
put	get
if you put the salt in you can t get it out

6559109
hash	salt
since you need the salt to compute a password hash in the login script you can t just store the hash of the salt as this would be an irreversible operation the original salt would be lost

6559109
hash	salt
this makes absolutely no sense however as the hash salt will still need to be stored in the database - in plaintext if you will

6559119
hash	md5
you can use a function such as md5 in order to calculate the hash of the password and compare the hash and store the password as a hash in the db

6559121
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade a tool check in the upgrade versioning so the source control history includes everything that is needed to build a particular versioning of your project

6559123
hash	salt
besides you can t hash the salt anyway because then you can t use it to check the passwords when someone want to log in

6559134
hash	md5
a popular hash algorithm is md5 php provides a built in function to make a md5 hash md5

6559134
hash	salt
it is best practise to salt the hash of the passwords you store

6559134
hash	md5
then you would hash the user input with md5 and compare that value with the password-hash stored in the database

6559163
inherited	properties
if this was a class i could use inherited to not repeat the code in the constructor and would likely have made a getter for that asint properties

6559204
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on google-chrome and firefox and both have the same result

6559209
try-catch	exception-handling
in your example after it throws the exception-handling the control of execution will go to java s exception-handling handler since you have not written any exception-handling handling code via try-catch blocks and finally end abruptly

6559236
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uitabbarcontroller there has a uinavigationcontroller under it which in turn has a subclass of uitableviewcontroller under it and that in turn contains the uitableview that is the initial content you see on the screen when tapping on the corresponding option in the tab bar

6559265
portrait	landscape
i ve built a game for ios that is designed for landscape mode and it works just fine except that if you turn the device to portrait mode it stops there to with the interface only filling about the middle half of the screen

if a is the parent with high values for width and height i drag and drop b into a - this works fine

6559510
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested with ie7 ie8 ie9 google-chrome opera firefox and safari

6559516
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
for example two tables with names different only in case may be created in a database with case-sensitive collation but may not be created in a database with case-insensitive collation

6559535
width	height
i can make a rough estimate by multiplying the width by the height and then by a multiplier number of bytes but i d like to calculate the size exactly if possible

6559545
swt	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swing	windowbuilder
for swing and swt you can use windowbuilder

6559551
rss	feed
i m trying to add the total number of comments made on an article on my site to an rss feed using feedburner

try mousemove instead of mouseover

6559574
folder	directory
i have a folder which php uploads to located in the directory above www home user upload

this works great for int or std string but obviously fails for string literals or chars pointers

6559628
post	get
foo bar to push get values in a post request i d suggest checking the request method instead

6559629
accessor	properties
the indexer then returns the first element of this array and the properties accessor .rolenames finally returns its rolenames properties

6559633
onresume	onpause
but in my development i ve never used onpause and onresume methods for the activity

6559638
udp	tcp
udp doesn t provide any mechanism for the server to communicate to the client unlike tcp which establishes a 2 way socket

6559639
flask	django
here is the code in sinatra if you don t understand it at this point i ll re-write it in flask snap rails django my app is on django .

6559643
hide	show
you can show a customized uilabel on app s load and then use performselectorafterdelay and hide the label inside this method

6559649
udp	tcp
you might also consider using tcp instead of udp in that case at least as a fallback since tcp streams are in general likely to have fewer issues with firewalls than udp packets

6559657
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction operations

6559657
division	multiplication
multiplication and division

6559660
post	get

6559699
fadein	removeclass	fadein	fadeout	fadein	addclass	removeclass	fadeout	slideup	slidedown	addclass	removeclass
essentially its just a vanilla javascript object that provides 4 simple animation types fadein fadeout + slidedown slideup along with some basic helper functions addclass removeclass etc

6559748
onresume	onpause
if it is killed when the users jumps back to your activity by pressing the back button onresume will be called and you should reconstruct the activity from the data you saved in onpause

6559798
for-loop	arrays
you could also run that inside of another for-loop that would run through the entire arrays giving you ten-element increments

6559815
width	height
width height 4 will get you close

6559861
hide	show
i dont have an exact solution but what i did was show a loading image to the user while the page loads up and then hide that loading image when the body and images are completely loaded

6559868
post	get
i need it to be loaded in the same page without sending it with post or get

6559881
mouseup	mousedown
when the user clicks it and when the user releases his click like mousedown mouseup

6559933
post	get
i discovered this blog post today which shows you how you can get a dump of your svn repository even if you don t have access to the machine where the respository is located

6559971
width	height
your imageview and relativelayouts have exactly the same layout sizes width and height so the relativelayout can t really be centered in the imageview

6560002
getter	setter
i am unclear whether i am accessing the backing ivar or going through the getter and setter in using the following syntax i will include my assumptions as to what i think it s doing

6560078
implements	extends
it s a shorthand way of implements an interface or extends an existing class usually an abstract adapter or helper class without bothering to name it

6560091
implements	extends
the best way to do it would be to extends the listpreference class and implements your own preference

6560095
ubuntu	linux
i am running mathematica on ubuntu linux 11.10 using the fglrx drivers

6560122
sequence	permutation
make a random permutation of the indexes and then use it to pick the next string in the sequence

6560136
post	put
i ll edit this post in about 10 minutes to put that into psuedocode at least

6560141
google-chrome	firefox
i have not been able to make a html5 button with a span inside of it look alike in google-chrome and firefox

6560141
google-chrome	firefox
see the link below in firefox and then in google-chrome

6560141
google-chrome	firefox
the text login is verticaly centered in google-chrome but in firefox the text is higher up

6560194
for-loop	loops
if you want to break loops use a traditional for-loop instead or write a custom foreach type of method that can be broken based on the return value of your function argument

6560253
fadein	fadeout
i am trying to put a fadeout and fadein on the css backgrounds to coincide with the appearance and disappearance of the forms but can t figure out how to combine fadeins and fadeouts with css elements properties

6560255

fiddler	charles
anyone can always use a debugging proxy like fiddler charles etc

6560345
pop-up	dialog
a selection dialog pop-up asking if i want to open this map in the maps application or the browser

6560348
int	chars
you can create a static int array that has 256 cells and increment proper index according to chars

6560357
int	chars
second chars actually being int you can subtract letters from letters

6560370
width	height
on an ideal camera that would be the center of the image so you can use width 2 height 2 for a start

6560407
onfocus	onblur
onfocus onblur would allow you to find out which one is currently active inactive

6560530
postgresql	mysql
fyi lastval is more or less the postgresql version of mysql s last_insert_id

6560530
postgresql	mysql
i only mention this because a lot of people are more familiar with mysql than postgresql so linking lastval to something familiar might clarify things

6560600
range	max
as rsapru suggested a max object maximum value is recommended to bound the graph to your preferred range

6560600
min	max
if you want to specify the graduations of the ticks you can do so manually by specifying ticks with the ticks object or have jqplot calculate tick spacing automatically nothing other than min and max objects would be needed in that case or by your specific number of ticks using numberticks object

6560629
google-chrome	safari
i ve run into a problem with webkit browsers google-chrome safari css3 media queries display and float on my site

6560673
pop-up	dialog
when the dialog pop-up i actually get in my button

6560692
post	get
just try to filter you post get requests with this function

6560780
children	parent	sorting	grouping
this will grouping parent together with their children sorting the former before the latter

6560798
webclient	httpwebrequest
if you continue to have issues with the webclient try justing using a plain old httprequest httpwebrequest

6560802
min	max
you need group by if you use min max i think

6560820
stdout	stderr
since you want to either see it as it runs and not capture it or capture everything and do something with it only at the end you can change the way it works in interactive mode by leaving stdout and stderr to none

6560857
google-chrome	firefox
if your primary user base is using ie6 7 or even 8 the page speed is going to be significantly slower than firefox or google-chrome

6560875
width	height
to get an nspoint of the center you can just get the x-coordinate of the origin and add width 2 and get the y-coordinate of the origin and add height 2

6560889
versioning	upgrade
a few days ago i upgrade the java sdk to the newest versioning 1.6.0_26 on my mac snow leopard 10.6.8

6560889
put	get
i can t put any code here because i don t get an error exception or something similar

6560918
int	double
int clip double value

6560949
put	get
but i have this tickets which return a list of tickets get a ticket id which get a particular item get and an activate method put that change the ticket status from not activated to activated

6560949
put	get
something like a get put at the same time but without knowing before hand the id for the put

6561051
carrierwave	paperclip
but the idea is same for both paperclip carrierwave

6561110
maven	pom.xml
when you invoke a maven goal from the command line it will only pick up your pom.xml s configuration element if that configuration was made directly under the element and not under any element

6561166
tiff	png
those images need to be converted to the same image filetype png jpeg tiff whatever as your placeholder images renamed to the same name as your placeholder images and placed in the same directory as the placeholder images that were referenced in your after effects project

6561172
folder	directory
additionally creating this directory gives a simple and easy-to-use folder for saved games and other such data.

6561186
children	parent
just deleting the parent didn t delete the dependent children from the datastore

6561191
folder	directory
just one thing on linux it is preferred to keep settings in a hidden folder in user directory

6561203
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so far i have been successful with google-chrome and firefox but not with safari

6561236
int	boolean
you can t convert an int to a boolean in java

6561245
int	chars
the input consists in three unsigned int and a string of punctuation chars

6561308
jscrollbar	jscrollpane
and you can use getverticalscrollbar and gethorizontalscrollbar to get a jscrollbar from a jscrollpane

6561333
int	chars
chars to set the value type in this case int to a nullable value type

6561351
implements	extends
this site has examples of how threads get run either through extends thread or by implements runnable

6561385
onclick	onmousedown
this is the correct onmousedown not onclick

6561388
width	height
alternatively you could do the math and calculate the difference in width height and rescale the image on the report accordingly the result is the image on the report will appear smaller

6561428
passenger	unicorn
i m using unicorn instead of passenger but the vhost part of the structure is the same for any backend

6561465
vmware	virtualbox
vmware and virtualbox are good ones

6561467
getter	setter
the idea of getter and setter are to allow developers to execute other required logic to derive the value for a class field

6561521
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade to the new versioning of your library you will have just broken all of my code

6561538
int	chars
int open unix2003 const chars pathname int flags mode_t mode

6561580
jar	.war
for instance a class in an .ejb jar can t see a class in your .war but the reverse is ok

6561581
tiff	bmp
such a format more likely is bmp with rle compression or the tiff image format with zip or rle compression

6561630
calloc	malloc
should malloc or calloc be used to avoid this garbage value

6561640
richfaces	icefaces
i d recommend using a jsf component library like richfaces or icefaces

6561699
pop-up	dialog
for the first pop-up it s recommended to use pure jqueryui and for your problem there is the element dialog

6561725
int	chars
in your first example you treat a pointer to an int like if it was a pointer to chars s

6561725
int	chars
incrementing a pointer to int adds 4 to it incrementing a pointer to chars adds 1 to it assuming 32 bit int and 8 bit chars

6561725
int	chars
dereferencing them makes an int and a chars respectively

6561725
int	chars
in your second example you treat the unsigned chars variable called sample as if it were a pointer to int and dereference it

6561725
int	chars
you are also passing a 1 byte chars and a 4 byte int to the second printf instead of 4+4 bytes that messes up printf reading 3 bytes more from the stack than you have given him

6561729
uploadify	swfupload
again i tried uploadify and swfupload

6561746
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux rails version is 3.0.9

6561768
accessor	properties
if you don t want that you will need to alter the base model to have a properties accessor by string with reflection but that is not very clever and fast to do on the datamodel

6561774
width	height
usually you do it in layout.xml setting appropriate layout parameters width height and scaletype

6561800
next	except
for example this question create a label in subversion indicating what files should be in the next release the 5 vote answer seems close but not quite there and this question using subversion tags to deploy to development staging testing server are similar to mine except the people attempting to answer don t seem to fully understand the subtleties

6561821
sqlparameter	oledb
read here for oledb samples using sqlparameter

6561823
width	height
first the css height width left and top properties take lengths

6561823
width	height
likewise you need to account for the unit on the values for the width and height

6561823
width	height
finally this will only work if the element has its width and height defined using inline style or if those properties have been set via javascript

6561855
kde	gnome
afaik you can t have wine applications look native on linux neither with qt or gtk+ the standard toolkits for kde and gnome respectively as wine emulates the win32 gui directly to the xserver libraries so there is no way that wine can talk to these toolkits however you can kinda use the colors

6561870
x86	64bit
im compiling to x86 tao wont run in 64bit

6561877
mongodb	bson
mongodb used bson a binary form of json

6561899
width	height
for the imagecontrol just set the height and width for the imagecontrol and the image will scale

6561899
width	height
if you dont set any height and width the control sets the appropiate height and width itself

6561907
width	margin
the main column might have a width of 100 but also a margin set in pixels for the secondary column to float in

6561917
width	height
to set the size of an image you would set it s width and or height using the width and height styles in css or the width and height html attributes in the image tag

6561918
width	height
the theory is that the function measures the browser viewports width and height and the video s width and height subtracts the video from the browser then divides that by two and applies it as left and top values in css

6561931
width	height
i believe it works when the width height are percentages too seems to but i m no css guru.

6561973
width	height
as the width and height styles are not set on the video element you have to pick up the size that is calculated for it

6561973
put	get	width	height
it s put in the width and height html properties so you can get those values and parse them

6562000
button	checkbox
if you are able to use win32 api try exploiting nm_customdraw notification not ownerdraw as i do yes button do send it including radio and checkbox

6562009
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
if i will try to resize my browser window both maps will be displayed correctly i ve tried this in firefox opera google-chrome

6562021
post	get
i ve read some post here and found some c# examples but i m unable to transfer them to vb.net - when i translate oauthconsumer example from dotnetopenauth i always get the following error message

6562041
rss	feed
you can ask your users to make their links public bitly.com - settings - make bitly.com history public after that you can access their links on their rss feed at

6562099
awt	swing	swt	swing
swing awt swt if you are using java or other jvm languages

6562128
google-chrome	safari
this works fine on all the desktop browsers including safari and google-chrome which use desktop webkit

6562144
put	get
gmail for example lets you put a + sign in the address to fake a different email someone gmail.com will also get email sent to someone+else gmail.com

6562178
post	get
this is my current query to get all post tagged with a specific category which is determined by the category s id

6562205
wordpress	joomla
yet if you are using any cms or framework wordpress joomla

6562207
udp	tcp
caches should be run in a separate process and can be called via tcp udp

6562273
hazelcast	terracotta
i would start with terracotta ehcache or hazelcast

6562292
dictionary	map
dictionary is obsolete so you should use some kind of map instead usually a hashmap

6562333
hash	md5
md5 hash are now considered broken because collision might happen

6562358
min	max
select a.id s.classes count p.id max p.date as last min p.date as first

6562385
dictionary	map
as kilian foth mentioned you should use map instead of dictionary

6562411
google-chrome	firefox
right now i m using google-chrome 26 and firefox 20 to test.

6562413
dictionary	map
basically use two dictionary one containing a mapping from operator names to boolean functions and another containing a map from the property names of the user type to propertyinfos used to invoke the property getter if public

6562433
implements	extends
another way to do this is to extends baseadapter and implements spinneradapter to create your own adapter which knows that the elements in your arraylist are objects and how to use the properties of those objects

6562469
cassini	iis
in my case i just decided to use cassini dev web server v4 and run the tests on that web server instead of iis

6562507
superclass	subclassing
the problem is i m misunderstanding something about the use of super in superclass methods that are called by subclassing or some other subclassing detail

6562507
superclass	subclassing
so get_defining_fields is defined in the superclass and the super call within it uses self.__class__ in an attempt to pass the correct subclassing name to the call in each subclassing

6562507
super	self
when called in bar it resolves to super bar self .get_defining_fields so that the list returned by foo.get_defining_fields would be prepended to the one returned by far.get_defining_fields

6562507
super	self
edit as per daniel roseman s answer i tried replacing the super call with this form return super foo self .get_defining_fields + self._defining_fields

6562523
junit	cactus
i have some junit test classes and some cactus tests which need to work on myapptestdb.currently what i am doing is replace all db related parameters in local.properties and hibernate.cfg.xml with the testdb values

6562533
int	double
it looks like you need double -division and not int -division

6562540
free	malloc
if you run the malloc 3 library function will request 100 megabytes of storage from the operating system or handle it out of the free lists

6562559
post	get
in javascript you make an xhr request either get or post to your php script

6562559
post	get
update in your case with the form onblur when they move out of focus of an element you could run the ajax request sending the value of the input and then in the ajax.php script as a get or post request you could run your validation query to check if the user exists already or if the username isn t valid or whatever

6562567
portrait	landscape
i m assuming you re trying to close popover of rootviewcontroller in portrait orientation because in landscape it doesn t make sense

6562588
folder	directory
i am developing a cms in which i hav to show the administrator the directory structue of root folder

6562618
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is also quite interesting to compare how google-chrome safari opera and firefox draw

6562637
jobs	cron
anything with the word task in it are generally meant to be run from the command line or as cron jobs so you shouldn t be looking at those for the normal running of your application

6562650
junit	testng
for example i use java hence i could make use of either junit or testng i prefer testng now testng lets me create suite decide what is a test what should not be executed during test run test reporting and much more

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m unsure if this works in every browser but on modern browsers firefox 3.6+ ie8 9 i think safari google-chrome with cache enabled simply adding the elements to the dom loads them and caches them put them on the page in a hidden div so the next time they re requested its from your cache not the server totally eliminating the flash

6562746
folder	directory
either you need to run as admin - then you have permission to create directory even in protected system folder - or you create the directory elsewhere and not inside a protected system folder

the former accesses the ivar directly while the later goes through the accessor of the properties testlist if you have one

6563020
disk	ram
relational database systems do their own disk swapping of course partly because they were designed when ram was more expensive and partly because they still sometimes deal with unusually large volumes of data

6563072
spweb	spsite
just a thought but you could always instantiate your own spsite spweb objects in your repository layer using the site web url like a connection string and the spsite spweb objects as connection objects

6563072
spweb	spsite
there may be a slight performance issue with creating your own spsite spweb objects vs the current spcontext objects but not sure how much

6563078
for-loop	loops
the for-loop never loops anything at all because objects don t have a length property and aren t indexed by number

6563084
gridview	rowdatabound
then inside rowdatabound event of the gridview add controls to the placeholder

6563100
mongodb	bson
imo storing user data in mongodb is fine -- you can do atomic operations on single bson documents so operations like allocate me this username atomically are doable

6563119
post	get
and yes you should be worried about sql injection if you use data directly from a post or get http request

6563156
eventlet	gevent
perhaps an easier way would be to just rely on gevent or eventlet to let you open lots of connections to the server

6563173
disk	ram
i would do my best to read the files in order as they appear on the disk minimize the amount of seeking across the device since files may be fragmented and read in large blocks of data into ram where it can be processed very quickly

6563218
children	parent
your controls should be children of your class derived from wxpanel not children of the panel s parent

6563267
children	parent
that is you can first jump to parent then to next then to children like this

6563312
hash	salt
you can store it salt and hash in a user settings file

6563316
hash	salt
you should one-way hash it using a good hashing algorithm such as sha512 preferably using a salt

6563348
hide	show
i need to made one uilabel thats show and hide intermittently likes information message in the main view.

after checking reigels idea and this one i wrote this simple solution to the common problem of styling a input field tested it on firefox safari and google-chrome

6563433
min	max
if you have more specific requirements you can limit the number of characters allowed by replacing the plus sign with or where min and max are the number of times the preceding match is allowed

6563449
for-loop	loops
the for-loop doesn t create a new scope so you re always referring to the same i variable which will hold the latest value after loops

6563621
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and firefox but does not work in google-chrome or safari even though the alert works

6563670
for-loop	arrays
so if you have to process a rather long arrays in a for-loop you can do something like this

6563676
post	get
now this loop is not executed if i use load but executed if i use .ajax or post or get

6563689
bmp	png
for example they might have a console application that will convert a bmp to a png and the gui calls this console application and passes the arguments etc to it

6563743
lxml	beautifulsoup
i d recommend using lxml or instead of beautifulsoup among other great features you can use xpath to grab your links

6563760
google-chrome	safari
this also works with google-chrome safari developers tools

6563767
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you re using firefox you can use firebug or if you re on safari or google-chrome you can use their developer tools console

6563776
int	boolean
create_constraint if the boolean is generated as an int smallint also create a check constraint on the table that ensures 1 or 0 as a value

6563829
post	get
the page that it post s to should us get to get the selected attribute from the drop down and then retrieve from the database or where ever the options that go into the second drop down based on the parameter

i have tried with datatype html and type post and get

6564014

check if the first chars is - to allow for negative numbers if you need them and add a try catch block to protect from numbers exceeding the range int min max value

6564014
min	max
if you don t have to deal with numbers approaching min max consider setting a max length maybe 6-7 digits and simply check string.length instead

6564146
int	boolean
if you turn a socket into an sslsocket using sslsocketfactory.createsocket socket string int boolean you can still turn it into a server-side sslsocket using sslsocket.setuseclientmode false as long as you haven t started to read write using the i o streams of the sslsocket this would trigger the handshake at you can t change the mode after that

it s functional in ie8 but not quite as pretty as it is in ie9 google-chrome or firefox

6564309
pull	push
if this was permissions public key issue i wouldn t be able to push pull to from the repo

6564322
innodb	myisam
myisam is better than innodb when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns

6564322
innodb	myisam
it s also worth mentioning that innodb supports row-level locking while myisam only supports table-level locking - which is to say that for many common situations innodb can be dramatically faster due to more queries executing in parallel

6564322
innodb	myisam
the bottom line use innodb unless you absolutely have to use myisam

6564394
ienumerable	ilist
in general foreach must support any ienumerable which only support forward enumeration of items in the collection as an alternative to reverse you could write your own optimized implementation that works on an ilist which provides an indexer

6564516
free	malloc
it has 2 restrictions that i want to remove so it works like malloc free

6564516
free	malloc
so the order of the malloc free calls matter or it will not work

6564574
int	chars
i guess this question is less about endianness and more about how the chars pointer and int work type conversion

6564584
post	get
actions in asp.net mvc don t distinguish betweed post and get as far as the parameters to the actions are concerned

6564584
post	get
now to the second issue you need to change all your links so that you use post instead of get you can do this by using ajax check out in jquery for that

6564585
post	get
however this doesn t really solve your problem as a sufficiently interested and knowledgeable user can just as easily craft a post as a get

6564597
getter	setter
i m wondering if there s a way to effectively force a type on instance variables rather their setter and getter that s easier than manually defining them

6564597
getter	setter
i could write my own getter and setter as class methods but if smarter folk have already done the heavy lifting i d rather not have to trust myself

6564604
width	height
your image can be a buffer of width height 3 bytes char

6564610
int	chars
and yes this test should work whether word is short int or long so long as they re bigger in size than a chars

6564615
sorting	filtering
see bea stollnitz s article for a very good introduction to why collectionviewsource is needed and how it works. once the collectionview exists you simply call refresh on it every time you modify the collection that it s based on and the view takes care of sorting filtering and notifying the ui

as is pointed out in the comments if it s xml just hand it to an xml parser like elementtree or lxml

6564691
for-loop	arrays
if you want to do this without returning a new arrays like calling reverse then use a for-loop

6564701
post	get
but you can use ajax to send a local javascript var to the server by get or post

6564894
inherited	properties
you can never create an instance of these you must create your own class that inherited from it and implement the abstract methods and properties

6564972
superclass	subclassing
the superclass might need some form of initialization in order for the subclassing to work as expected

6565024
entities	entitymanager
hibernate entitymanager can use the metamodel classes to verify that a criteria is valid for a given set of entities

6565042
for-loop	arrays
with an arrays you typically want iteration of numeric indices and as such should use a standard for-loop

6565084
maven	pom.xml
i noticed that there are signatures for every jar and pom.xml file in maven central repository

6565084
maven	pom.xml
so at least i d like to check signatures of all maven downloaded files pom.xml jar

6565084
maven	pom.xml
however i didn t find any information on how to force maven 2 or 3 to verify signatures of downloaded jar pom.xml files

6565089

6565094
hide	show
ah found the problem myself had another function which was using keyup event there the input length was used to show hide the submit_twitter button like if len 140 hide button else show button this function was responsible for showing the button all the time as the len was ofcourse less then 140 characters

6565112
operands	scalar
vs2008 is notorious for doing all it s calculations in registers and i guess there will be some hazards that the cpu cannot skip like xor reg move mem- reg xor mov mem- reg mul mov mem- reg which is a dependency chain while the scalar code might be move mem- reg mul with mem operands mov. you should definitely look at the generated assembly or try vs 2010 which has much better support for intrinsincs

6565167
post	get
the code of the html+css would get a bit too long to post here

6565167
width	height
the image on the right is what you get after changing font size to 16px and making the color box s red width and height 1em and moving it down by 3px top 3px - the question still is all this could have been avoided by just having the content vertically center in the div in the first place

6565212
ubuntu	linux
and now i want to open files in a different permission mode in linux ubuntu

6565231

6565494
put	get
get rid of the whole block and put the following in place

6565498
free	malloc
when i call malloc it only allocates memory and put it s address to the pointer also free only frees the memory that pointer is pointing to

6565511
google-chrome	firefox
i m not actually sure if that s necessary because i haven t found anything in the java php and mozilla javascript regex docs that say hyphens need to be escaped like that and my tests in firefox 5 and google-chrome 12 show that it works either way

6565512
google-chrome	firefox
i looked at the reference video here which is encoded in three different forms ensuring it can play correctly in firefox which supports ogg google-chrome which supports webm and whatever supports m4v

6565512
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this on an ipad 2 with the latest updates a samsung galaxy tab with android 3.1 and a nexus one with android 2.3 as well as firefox 5 and google-chrome 12 on os x 10.6.8

6565512
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome played perfectly

6565514
width	height
if i recall correctly from a video from google i o setting the width or height of a listview to wrap_content will cause it to measure the first 3 items and base its dimensions off of those

6565515
avro	thrift
the drivers are also not very mature or well documented from what i ve seen so far and everyone seems to be squabbling about whether thrift avro or cql is what should be used and that has changed from 0.6 to 0.7 to 0.8

6565515
put	get
it seems tried and true but as with mongodb you have to watch out for sharding issues you must put some thought into your keys or you get into trouble

6565586
svg	vml
vml was microsoft s version of svg before they decided to drop development of vml but continue to support it in favor of svg

6565586
svg	vml
raphaã l rã feéªé l uses the svg w3c recommendation and vml as a base for creating graphics

6565599
post	get
the specific problem i m talking is about processing a filled form requested via post and then redirecting the browser because of the prg post redirect get pattern which includes that exit will be called and the code isn t continued after the require respectively function call

6565625
children	parent
as far as i can see from the code you posted the absolute div you created is the child of one of the children of the brother of your user-3 div d this means that it floats on top of the last relative positioned item in his parent

6565641
mvp	presenter
as for your multiple views question if you have complex logic in that part of the form but i don t see it in your example you could probably separate that in separate user control mvp triad - this helped me to reduce and simplify the code of the presenter

6565710
google-chrome	firefox
works in ie firefox but in google-chrome it refuses to scroll up

6565724

6565778
google-chrome	firefox
tested and working on google-chrome firefox ie8+ android and ios

6565805
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in the first case the variables should be nsmutablestring and i should cast them to nsstring using the copy method whenever they need to be arguments of functions that require nsstring objects

6565861
post	get
you could bind your read only columns to hidden fields so that the model you get from post back will be complete though this could be a security problem depending on why you chose to hide the other columns

6565871
flask	django
flask has en embedded test server like django does

6565885
fiddler	charles
the way fiddler and charles do this is by inserting themselves as the system proxy

6565905
width	height
now i am not able to resize the image based on the specified height and width

6565912
nsmutablestring	nsstring
in the first case the variables should be nsmutablestring and i should cast them to nsstring using the copy method whenever they need to be arguments of functions that require nsstring objects

6565912
nsmutablestring	nsstring
remember inheritanceâ an nsmutablestring is an nsstring just with some new stuff tacked on

6565923
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the only difference between nsmutablestring and nsstring is that mutable string can be changed

6565923
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you don t have to cast anything since nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring nor take different memory measures so you are right

6565925
width	height
i would suggest placing a single div on your page with fixed width and height

6565960
maven	pom.xml
file | open project specify pom.xml path in idea maven projects panel you ll see the goals

6566002
free	malloc
you wrote you are looking for ideas so i am attaching one of my projects i ve done at university in which we should implement malloc and free ..

6566018
int	chars
the only valid explanation i can come up with is that the tag at the start may contain chars from the extended ascii table and since java doesn t have unsigned int a 1111_1111 255 byte might be interpreted as -1 when converted to int

6566027
qscrollarea	qvboxlayout
i m trying to put a qvboxlayout inside a qscrollarea in order for it to be scrollable vertically

6566030

portrait	landscape
i got idea to put some overlay on camera view and if iphone is in portrait mode to put some label with text use landscape mode instead of portrait

6566159
findwindow	postmessage
you probably need to wrap findwindow or similar so that you can govern which window will receive the keystrokes and you will need to use postmessage to inject wm_keyup and wm_keydown or whatever they are it s been a very long time since i did this sort of thing into the message queue for the hwnd of the target window

6566233
inherited	properties
both of these inherited from itemviewmodelbase and implement the appropriate properties

6566240
google-chrome	firefox
you can paste any of the three code samples above into the edit control and can see what happens with each version of the postcanvastoblobstore function the first sample will work in google-chrome the second will work in firefox and is the version the debug app defaults to and the third should work from all three but works for none of them when using this production website probably because of a blobstore bug.

6566268

6566352
post	get
if a high enough percentage of users delete the post that gets added to their wall or mark it as spam or choose to hide all post from your application the application will get removed and the post removed as you have experienced

6566366
uilabel	nsstring
for example firstpicname is nsstring and is retained when is set its container is uilabel firstpiclabel which is assigned like this

6566390
width	height
to make the icon container take a width and a height

6566466

folder	directory
the app folder ends up in this directory which i found by searching the windowsazureproject2 directory tree

6567112
folder	directory
update after doing some more reading it appears to me that what s really happening is that the approot directory is not being created and my app folder files are not being copied over either

6567121
integer	unsigned
the comparison will try to promote the integer value of d -1 to an unsigned long which will result in something like 0xffffffffffffffff and that s greater than 7-2 5 the result of total_elements-2

6567126
button	checkbox
it s a radio button not a checkbox and maybe another radio button in the same group with the same name is already checked

6567129
width	height
you can resize on the fly simply by changing the width and height of the image tag

6567129

folder	directory
if successfully complied this will create a .sys file in some folder in the current directory

6567390
folder	directory
in iis7 if it s a virtual directory you are not using the files from that folder to compiled the app instead from the root websites executable folder

6567390
folder	directory
so - your app in iis 7 needs to be an application in order to compile and search the bin folder for those resources - othewise its just a virtual directory which is some path on the url that points to some path on the disk

if you initialize p to point to an area with sufficient space to hold the string or you assign not strcpy hello world to p thus pointing it to the area in initialized program memory where the literal string is stored or you use strdup instead of strcpy it will work

6567519
portrait	landscape
then at a certain point i push to a view that displays a graph which i want to only display in landscape and not even be in portrait at all this screws up how the view looks

6567519

6567929
trie	tree
i ve seen linked list implementations used in trie s somewhat similar to radix tree and possibly some radix tree it s been a while since i ve last researched this topic but that seems like it d perform very poorly especially if you have a set of data which contains lots of common prefixes

6567955
aggregate-functions	sum
you can t use the sum aggregate-functions on a string field

6567962

6568053
portrait	landscape
i dint see the links you included in your question but i have some idea how to render pdf.use two tiledlayers side by side on a single view when you are in landscape mode.you should make your viewcontroller class delegate to both layers and handle content rendering in drawlayerincontext method for both layers differently by changing the cgpdfpageref of the pdf document to display consecutive pages.set the frames of the layers so that first layer occupies first half of the screen and other occupies second half.you may want to hide one layer and change the frame of other when your reader is in portrait mode

6568074
codeigniter	cakephp
this could affect any existing output depending on your application is set up so you would want to call formatimage before anything is output possibly by wrapping the page in some kind of view container like how an mvc framework like cakephp or codeigniter works

6568099
pop-up	dialog
so the dialog pop-up again and again

6568370
put	get
also i had to put in a settimeout into the page to get pageload to call in firefox

6568370

6568702
switching	screens
usually if i switching user or log off my credentials should appear there on the logon screens

6568808
post	get
however this means that i have to duplicate all the list loading in both the get and the post methods

6568838
getter	setter
current default binding generates list for me getnameandvaluelist but i want separate getter and setter for name and value respectively

6568838
getter	setter
i am looking to have the default list generation along with the getter setter for name and value or have name and value as inner classes

6568838
getter	setter
if i remove the maxoccurs 4 option i can generate getter setter but since i can t modify the schema i am trying to get that behavior using external binding file

active-directory	adam
really if you want to test the content of an active-directory the very best way is to install an active-directory application mode adam

6568931
daemons	launchd
the best solution for you is to rewrite agent not to use command line but to connect to launchd daemons and ask for proper options settings

6568931
daemons	launchd
if it is not possible or hard you can write wrapper launchd agent that will on start connect to daemons ask for options and then launchd original agent with proper command line

6568931
daemons	launchd
maybe it is but it is much easier than launchd agent in other session from daemons when implemented right with different corner cases support

6568967

6569119
post	get
i agree it could be a small issue or it could be a big one some example code would help us aid you if you try to connect to a server 3 times using the same port you will get an error because you can only have 1 connection per port the problem could be super simple or very complex if you edit your post and add your code then we can better help you

6569154
folderbrowserdialog	openfiledialog	folder	directory
assuming your solution is winforms and your user is selecting a directory i m not sure how to interpret your use of path -- the file s path or a path to a directory a folderbrowserdialog might be more appropriate than a openfiledialog as it allows you to choose the folder directly

i ve got an aspx page with a gridview bound to a sqldatasource containing a radiobuttonlist in each row

6569379
gridview	radiobuttonlist	gridview	sqldatasource
i do have a very ugly working solution with attaching to the onupdating event of the sqldatasource and then looping over all gridview rows to find the row in which the radiobuttonlist control is not null the one row that is being updated but i do hope that there is a better way to solve this issue

the key point is that you use a fixed point table index so that you can specify an accurate delta for each sample - you use the integer part to get the table indices and then optionally interpolate between adjacent samples using the fractions part of the index

6574780
pull	push
if you want to pull in your production server or push to your production server from the central server and if you are using a hook like update post-receive or post-update you can easily make them pull or push only if you commit to the stable branch

6574780
pull	push
by checking the name of the ref to be what you want stable and then doing a push or pull to the production server will help you achieve the selective update that you want

6574793
equals	gethashcode
to improve these classes you might implement equals gethashcode iconvertible serialization validation etc

6574817
for-loop	arrays
what i want is if an object is removed for the condition to be reevaluated so the for-loop doesn t try to do anything with arrays objects that don t exist but i don t want it to add to the count because if it does the for-loop will never end as it will keep adding objects that add more objects etc

6574834
np-hard	np-complete
hence in most of the cases the decision problem is np-complete to find whether the set of cities contain a tour while the optimization problems are np-hard finding the minimum length tour

6574850

both version seems to work in ie8 ff4 google-chrome opera and safari

6574970
openrowset	openquery
you can openrowset opendatasource or openquery as shown below second option doesnt need any linked server creation

6575002
client-side	server-side
please consider that you whatever you do in client-side you should always check the values at the server also have server-side validation as there are multiple hacks around like form-spoofing

6575035
post	get
therefore they don t get passed via get or post to your something.php file so you can t output them in an array

6575045
width	height
you can t set a width and height for a background-image in css afaik

6575047
mouseover	mouseout
w3c says that event.relatedtarget is the element where mouse comes from in a mouseover event or the element that the mouse goes to in a mouseout event

6575047
mouseover	mouseout
however ie uses two separate properties for those two cases event.fromelement is the element the mouse comes from in a mouseover event while event.toelement is the element the mouse goes to in a mouseout event

6575056
children	parent
or if it s not important that the children can pass their results back to the parent in realtime you can use forkmanager s ability to pass data back to the parent on exit through the finish call which would look something like

6575065
put	get
i have an instance of the above class called mstate and use the following to put it in and get it out of a bundle

6575075
lxml	libxml2
or use lxml which wraps the libxml2 in a pythonic xml classes

6575077
getter	setter
one trick that comes to mind is to put any fields like this into an abstract class which provides the necessary getter setter methods

6575102
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

cos	sin
so to find the sin and cos of 30 degree say

6575170
hide	show
if valid the button click hide its panel and show the second panel for step #2 which contains another customvalidator

6575198
pthreads	fork
there is no portable way to implement a variant of fork that preserves all threads using the interfaces provided by pthreads

6575208
hash	md5
edit - another option is to use the existing format and create an md5 hash the code would be something like

6575221
getter	setter
or you could put the logic that populates childrennames into a non getter setter method and invoke it manually after the query

6575225
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with firefox and google-chrome but i have spend the last 1 hour trying to get it work with ie9

6575250
qmainwindow	qwidget
i created two new qwidget form classes in addition to the qmainwindow

6575255
caanimation	calayer	uiview	caanimation	uiview	calayer
in general rather than using caanimation s on calayer s you can use uiview animation

6575261
glog	gflags
i use gflags with glog and if you run --help the option logbuflevel might be what you are looking for

6575275
superclass	subclassing
having not used mkmapview before but you might be able to subclassing it and in your drawrect method first draw the superclass and then use standard cg drawing methods to draw your heading angle on top of it

6575294
folder	directory
split them by 1000 in folder or by 100 take first second and third symbols of id string and put in separate directory

6575304
folder	directory
navigate to the utilities folder inside the flash builder 4.5 installation directory and find a file called adobe flash builder 4.5 plug-in utility.exe or similar if on mac

6575340
int	double
i ve had no problem storing int and various pointers as void pointers but i get an error when trying to cast a double as a void pointer

6575340
int	double
i understand that double are stored differently than int and pointers at the bit level but i don t understand why i can t place whatever bits i want into the pointer assuming it has enough memory allocated and then take them out later casting them as a double

6575421
getter	setter
i can put the getter and the setter on separate interfaces like this

6575421
getter	setter
i could do it in a java-esque way with separate getter setter methods on each interface

6575440
nowjs	node.js
i would suggest looking into node.js and the nowjs plugging which allows for realtime updates via websockets

6575464
min	max
i am creating a tic tac toe with min max so i can expand it to alpha-beta pruning

6575464

so during my min max i find if a path with lead to +1 x win -1 o win or 0 draw however for a board config such as this

6575464
min	max
should i check each table for a block then it would not run as fast and i don t think thats how min max should be implemented

6575464
min	max
can someone explain why the min max is not smart enough to detect that

6575508

in this case try to define run debugging profiling on the parent s project level

6575517
width	height
just set your panel s width and height as follows

6575538
fontfamily	font-size
when using scale it draws the text with the standard fontfamily font-size if no other font have been specified which can result in a non-smooth character

6575538
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
for me the rotation and scaling looks the same in google-chrome firefox though i havent istalled 5.0 yet and opera except the uglyness that comes from scaling

6575563

6575571
chunked	transfer-encoding
all php output buffering are off apache mode_deflate is activated but as you can see the transfer-encoding is chunked

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
use an uinavigationcontroller that manages 2 uiviewcontroller s one for each of the views you described above

6575587
try-catch	exception-handling
also a little hint put your processing logic inside the try-catch block because if the initialization fails you might catch that exception-handling but go on to try call a method on an uninstantiated or uninitialized class

6575592
hash	md5
i use an md5 hash of the userid and time though

6575593
inherited	properties
however the way you describe your problem i think you want to create a tree-like structure of objects not have classes inherited properties from each other

6575599
getter	setter
i have been trying to follow the suggestion about using getter setter but i guess i donâ t know enough

6575599

6575971
post	get
get places all key value-pairs in the url field whereas post puts it in the http body

versioning	upgrade
it might be easier to upgrade to python 2.7 especially if you work with someone else together who uses this versioning

6576106
bash	subshell
to avoid the creating of a subshell for the while loop we use bash s process substitution feature together with input redirection instead of a simple pipe

6577059
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if your model already implements inotifypropertychanged and uses collection types that implement inotifycollectionchanged i personally feel that directly encapsulating and binding to source.name in xaml has some real advantages - mainly it dramatically reduces the amount of code and it more importantly reduces the amount of unnecessary code duplication

6577061
folder	directory
you do not need to make any change in your zf public folder just create an .htaccess file into the subfolder directory with the following lines

basically rather than saving blobs into your database which isn t always a good idea you can instead save the blobs to the ntfs filesystems using transactional ntfs

6577263
fadein	hide
to hide the element and then fadein you should use .css display none or hide followed by fadein like so

6577295
config	ini
if you have many elements and do not wish to pollute the parent init method very much i suggest you place the complete element definitions in an external file which can be either a php file which returns a php array with the full config a xml file ini file or any other format supported by zend_config you can define the elements without a piece of actual php code - here -at the bottom of the page- is an example of defining an element with an ini file

6577324
.htaccess	httpd.conf
put the line above to your httpd.conf if possible...then restart the server or to a .htaccess -file on the top-level of the document_root no restart needed

you can only free memory that was previously malloc ed calloc ed or realloc ed as dlev and daniel have said

here is a fiddle that will work firefox google-chrome safari and touchscreen mobile devices

6583419
width	height
i don t know to explain very well why this happens but it s related to your setting the +id fcplaydown imagebutton to center in parent and his parent being a relativelayout with wrap_content width and height the layout just gets confused

6583427
mallet	maxent
i am using the maxent algo in mallet for label classification

you might want to consider using an mvvm framework such as caliburn.micro and take a viewmodel first approach

6583512
rss	feed
if rss feed are enabled you can navigate to something like and you get the content i m looking for as a page but i need to add that content to the product1 page

6583513

in the right-hand pane of your nssplitview you could place a tab-less nstabview

6583528
children	parent
but i m not sure how to modify this to get the parent and the children for all of the terms within service_line_category in a list

6583531
width	height
- playing with the width and height of the layout buttons

6583532
spaces	delimiter
while i don t know specifically i highly suspect that pdflib s definition of a word is any white spaces delimiter substring from a text placement operator. this definition will get you maybe 80 of the way there

6583563
portrait	landscape
so the activity and layout is always portrait but my nested views need to be notified and re-drawn when the phone is tilted from portrait to landscape

6583570
hash	md5
and finally the signature is a md5 hash of message m

6583576
portrait	landscape
i ve used media queries to target ios and it looks fine in portrait orientation but doesn t fit to width 100 in landscape

6583582
google-chrome	firefox
this is sporadic and i see it happening most of the time with firefox 4.0.1 and 5.0 and to a lesser extent with google-chrome

google-chrome	firefox
my response as seen via firebug in firefox 5 and google-chrome is empty

6583604

see for proper strcpy strncpy parameters

6583688
post	get
anyway since i didnt strictly need a post request for the link used a get instead to get the desired behaviour

6583728
int	double
assert.areequals is overloaded to compare int double object etc

6583764
width	margin
also the left is collapsible i use jquery to hide it with negative margin then i need the right to have the full width

6583784
jobs	cron
i d like it to all be in one script if possible so not that keen on using cron jobs to run it - surely there is some way of doing a loop with a delay in purely in a shell script

6583815
rvm	bundler
in the fcgi settings i can specify the commandline command to execute for running my application sinatra rack bundler the whole thing and this is what i d do without rvm

6583824
awt	swing
if you were using jframe swing rather than frame awt you would use jframe.setdefaultcloseoperation int and specify exit_on_close

6583942
post	get
to get a user s account information you need to send a post request to call first

6583944
parsley	cairngorm

firefox	safari
edit so fishbasketgordo s answer got my script to work for ie and safari but it wasn t working in firefox

6583973
viewdidload	viewwillappear
that is what the viewdidload and viewdidunload are used for not the viewwillappear and viewwilldisappear or viewdiddisappear

6583976
versioning	upgrade
i can t remember if i purchased the c# versioning or the c#+vb versioning and i d like to find out as you need to know this when purchasing the upgrade to r# 6

6583986
viewdidload	didreceivememorywarning
proper use of - void viewdidload - void viewdidunload and - void didreceivememorywarning will allow you to maximize memory and performance

6583987
httpresponse	request
one way of doing this which i got working was to use httpresponse to execute a new request and then get the page content and search through that to get the title

6583998
width	height
better idea is to resize the image to max 480 in width or max 800 in height and the show it with with appropriate padding

6584004
width	height
i would like it to wrap around the image to have the same width and height

6584004
width	height
the width is currently the same but i just can t get the height to match

6584015
openfire	ejabberd
ejabberd or openfire will be xmpp server

6584015
openfire	ejabberd
i m flexible with using ejabberd or openfire as my xmpp server

6584023
mouseleave	mouseenter
that way the anonymous function will be called only on mouseenter change the order of the params if you want it called on mouseleave

6584051
hlsl	glsl
today the term is mostly associated with glsl hlsl or cg which allow convenient hardware agnostic high-level programmability on consumer gpus

6584096
width	height
basically the code below is executed in ie6 and opens up a window of the width height i would expect

6584096
width	height
however in ie 8 or i guess ie 7 given that on intranet apps it will be forced to compatibility mode the dialog is opened with a larger width height

6584096
width	height
i ve a vague idea there might be a minimum width height being enforced but i can t find any documentation to back this up.

6584135
free	malloc
i think you cannot free the memory because free doesn t know how much memory to free.your program has information about the address malloc returned and not for every address in this space.so you can free s1 but not free s1+3 .also you can handle your pointers as an array in this example

6584137
pop-up	dialog
so say the dialog below pop-up my goal is to automatically click save file and then hit ok

6584205
pull	push
if you re using eclipse open up the android file explorer view and use the pull from device push to device buttons in that view s toolbar to copy files back and forth

6584220
opera	firefox
that is not entirely the truth - i encountered exactly the same problem the font in firefox and opera is rendered thin on font-weight normal but webkits render it bold - when i apply the font weight bold to the styles in all browsers they look the same

6584224
tinyint	boolean
just use tinyint 1 so cake can use it as boolean value

you ll get better answers if you post the ddl of the table

6584421
rss	feed
the problem is that you are trying to parse rss tags in an atom feed

6584472
put	get
the workaround would be to use xmlreader.readouterxml to get the whole xml as a string and put it in a memorystream

6584547
post	get
my problem is that i have an ajax post the make dropdownlist will do an ajax posting on change and get the model based on the make i want to call the method in the lookupcontroller right away from the view and not passing through the vehicledetailscontroller which knows that my lookupcontroller has a lookupservicesql i want the contrainer to know that i want the lookupservicesql not the lookupservicesolr

6584559
put	get
once i can get one element of the string array to convert to byte i will put a loop around it for each position in the string array but it says the string format is not correct for the byte.parser

6584651
uilabel	uibutton
all i have set initially is so you can t see the uilabel but the uibutton below it won t work anymore

6584673
inline	inlining
those rules might take account of whether the function is marked inline or not but quite likely don t unless you re using compiler options to force inlining or whatever

6584684
opera	firefox
ie6 netscape 6+ firefox and opera 7+ copy the following script in your page

6584729

you need to wrap around using setinterval or settimeout

6584731
joomla	typo3
drupal typo3 mambo joomla rely on

6584751
hide	show
the product status has a website scope meaning that you can hide or show a product per website affecting all store views for that website

6584839
uilabel	uibutton
when you want to hide your uibutton with your uilabel

6584848
multiton	singleton
this singleton is not thread safe if a thread is trying to get an instance while another is also trying to do the same race condition it may happen that before that the thread number one finishes the creation of the instance the second has already had access to the getinstance method and created his own instance of the singleton which means that at a t time we should have two instances of the singleton called multiton at that time

6584861
inherited	subclassing
why not build subclassing which inherited from xmlmodel then the decision between the classes is just at one point in the code

6584872
post	get
however every time i try to post some xml to hello i get a message that the format is invalid and it wants specifically encoded string

6584879
rss	feed
i have an rss feed from a tableview and when i click on a cell it pushes to the webview

6584882
actionscript	mxml
but then it won t catch any default skins or skins set in actionscript or inline mxml

6584902
post	get
your question seems a little confusing -- i assume you must be doing get rather than post as there s no real limit on post

6584902
post	get
so the first thing i would do is make sure you re using post and not get

6584953
google-chrome	firefox
i have a horizontal menu that works fine in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie8

6584985
pop-up	dialog
you can t do that but you can make the device pop-up a dialog with a call button which will start a phone call

6585034

you must prepare sql query with in statment and then execute query just once.

6585062

6585103
google-chrome	firefox
this was easy enough under ie firefox google-chrome plugins

6585108
clang	llvm
i don t really know about llvm clang but since clang has an option -wsystem-headers to enable warnings from system headers i d assume it does something similar to gcc for system headers suppress warnings for them

6585112
google-chrome	firefox
it seems like there has been a change to some recent version of google-chrome and firefox and now javascript execution seems to be different when the tab it is being run in is not the currently focused one

6585112
google-chrome	firefox
at the very least it s happening now on firefox 5.0 and google-chrome 12

6585117
versioning	upgrade
i got weird issues when i upgrade my sproutcore app from 1.6.0.rc1 to newer versioning

6585153
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval have been throttled to a minimum of 1000ms in unfocused tabs

6585153
google-chrome	firefox
i believe this is the case in firefox 5 and in google-chrome since version 11

6585163
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox do this now maybe safari too

6585168
post	get
this is because all modern http is methods post and get and codes 403 404 200

6585212
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the css works fine however in ie7+ there are problems

6585227
put	get
from these notifications i get the height of the keyboard and that tells me where to put the bottom edge of the search bar

6585271
domcontentloaded	onload
if so - the domcontentloaded event might have already been fired even window s onload might and there is no way to actually call the code on domready in such situation

6585277
folder	directory
rubygems tries to install gems for system-wide access in a system-wide folder by default but it has a mode that lets you install them in a directory in your home directory

6585282
rss	feed
that page has an associated rss feed in atom format at - that d be more reliable to work from than scraping the html

6585299
joomla	typo3
we re better than the other guys like drupal typo3 mambo joomla because.

6585301
put	get
i really just stumbled through this until i put enough puzzle pieces together to get this to work

6585320

there are official ubuntu packages and the installation instructions explicitly mention amd64 as a target plattform installing scipy linux

6585325
ubuntu	linux
i m a new comer to linux ubuntu so if i make any silly mistake please forgive me

6585348
umbraco	examine
there are some custom configuration sections used for configuring examine and various other elements of umbraco and the relevant declarations in the web.config need to be set which they re not in the default .net3.5 config

6585371
linkbutton	selectedindexchanged
you need a buttonfield or a postback control such as a button linkbutton imagebutton with the commandname select for the selectedindexchanged event handler to trigger

6585389
margin	height
i wanted a percentage height and top-margin for my container div but the body would take on the margin of the container div

6585393
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried the following code in firefox and google-chrome which work fine

6585446
beyondcompare	winmerge
for 1000 lines this shouldn t be too hard with a simple visual diff tool like beyondcompare or winmerge free

6585545

when i build my wix project it creates a bootstrapper folder in the output directory bin debug bootstrapper

6585576
button	checkbox
each question can be any one of the types checkbox radio button etc with multiple options

6585602
width	height
the 2nd argument is the bounding width and height imgscalr will use to scale the image -- keeping its proportions correct even if you passed in invalid dimensions -- there are many more detailed methods but that is the simplest usage

6585633
accessor	properties
you re not using the properties accessor mutator to set your class properties and you re releasing them in a method other than your dealloc method which is going to cause issues

6585633
accessor	properties
at the least you re violating the basic memory management rules by allocating eventstring detailsstring and date in initevent which is then the owner because you don t use a properties accessor mutator and releasing them in the eventdictionary method which is not the owner

6585643
parsley	robotlegs
with that said my 2 personal choices are robotlegs and parsley

6585643
parsley	robotlegs	flex	robotlegs
parsley is more robust and adds a lot more features than robotlegs which is why its been used in the world s largest flex applications

6585660
google-chrome	safari
the problem only occurs when the user is managed for parental controls. it does not happen for standard or administrator users and it does not happen in safari or google-chrome for any users

6585662
hash	md5
md5 is intended to be a one-way hash

6585668
hash	md5
an md5 hash password is not reversible

6585668
hash	salt
generate a token maybe hash a timestamp with a salt and store it into the database in the user s record

6585668
hash	md5
when you hash a value like a password using the md5 function in php the final value is going to be the same for that password no matter which server you run it on

6585668
hash	md5
you md5 hash a bunch of dictionary words weak passwords in order to get their md5 hash values

6585668
hash	md5
now when the rainbow table is run against your database it s not as easily reversed because the md5 hash of password is different than password384746

6585668
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

6585729
getter	setter
this could be dangerous as you might have logic in the property setter getter but if they don t have logic you could say

6585734
scikit-learn	pybrain
i ve been reading the documentation of different machine learning libraries in python pyml scikit-learn pybrain but i haven t found anything useful

6585739
move	drag
i know why i m getting these messages it s because i am changing the left property every time the mouse is move but this is the behavior i want because it is a drag operation

6585762

intersect	contains
running profiler shows that the bottleneck is from threadsafe.py which are called by geosgeometry operations intersect unions contains etc. inside my similarity function

6585874
modifiers	sealed
the sealed modifiers only applies when a method is already an override of a member in the base class

6585875
move	drag
the 3 cards below should be move via drag

6585879
hash	md5
first of all i would suggest moving off of md5 to a stronger hash function such as the sha2 family

6585879
hmac	pbkdf2
therefore you will get your client to do hmac data pbkdf2 somesecret 1000 and the server will just store pbkdf2 somesecret 1000 then do hmac data storedresult

6585885
win64	windows
the sad fact is that our grid needs to be hosted on win32 since all the test pcs run windows xp 32bit with an option to upgrade to win64 at sometime in the future

6585925
post	put
here are a couple post put together by jeff and me explaining the reasoning and better alternatives

6585989
put	get
if you have img tags inside a container div with class .div1 they will of course get the styling you define in .div1 img but if you want lets say 2 images out of 8 in that div to have another style which i believe is why you made class .myimg you need to put

6585999
getter	setter
unfortunately in this case the method of calling getter setter from the base which is a friend would create more problems than it solves - the code should be as clean as easy to follow and as connected to the physics as possible in the implementation of the tool itself a user should not need to be an expert in either c++ or the inner workings of the program to create a tool

6586040
post	get
if i delete all the entries in the post model i get an error when i try reference the first item in the post list ordered by date which i did like this

i m working with a table item which has the field aprovado and it s an int that checks if the item is approved or not 1 for yes 0 for no not my table i would have chosen proper boolean

6586119
gif	png
you can t easily resize an image from one file size to another but most jpg png gif etc

6586150
hash	md5
you could for example calculate the sha1 or md5 or any other hash of the coordinates + seed and use it in the prng

6586187
inherited	subclassing
if you re performing the same basic html modifications you could subclassing system.web.ui.page implement your custom rendering and then have all of the emails inherited from your new subclassing

6586196
jcomponent	jdialog
is so hard to manage focus between two jframes better would be create only one jframe and other top-level containers would be jdialogs create one two jdialog s and reuse that by removing all jcomponent

6586516
profiling	instrumentation
there s no way to tell whether object allocation and deallocation are performance bottlenecks in your code without some work in the profiling shark or instrumentation

6586608
folder	directory
you must have the entire path to this folder in the from directory field

6586608
folder	directory
so for example if the project folder you are reconnecting is named common the from directory should have something like c xampp htdocs common in it

6586608
folder	directory
select the check box next to the folder displayed in the window below from directory to specify that you want to import all files in the folder

6586626
keydown	keyup	keydown	keyevent	keyevent	keyup
just as an addendum to chad s response which worked almost perfectly for me i found that i needed to add a check on the keyevent action type to prevent my code executing twice once on the keyup and once on the keydown event

inherited	properties
the context class inherited from objectcontext and exposes my poco entities as public properties

6586673

when i run this code i get the exception ora-01426 numeric overflow. i am not doing any calculations and i put the whole thing into a string before i submit the query

6586732
dsn	pervasive
the timberline system uses a pervasive database and my app communicated with it via and odbc driver using a dsn

6586738

this will however also mess with the background-color of the parent and not allow you to select the text underneath the transparency div

6586743
ant	maven
the manager-script role is the designed way to go for ant maven scripts

6586766

there is only one difference between testng and junit in this specific area junit will create a brand new instance of your test before each test method testng will not

6586770
entity-relationship	diagram
an entity-relationship diagram showing all of the tables they use and their key relationships would help ensure that they always use the correct keys

6586791
entity-relationship	diagram
assuming the database has the proper pk s and fk s in place it would probably help a great deal to generate an entity-relationship diagram

6586825
int	boolean
the most common types are string int and boolean but you can also store values as color object or as a connection string

6586830
post	get
i know i can override onactionexecuting actionexecutingcontext filtercontext for each controller- but it sounds crazy to have to handle each action seperately get the id or object depending on if its a post or get and then check if the operation is allowed

6586853
uicontrol	uibutton
another note if you want to intercept touches to that shadow view you can either make it a giant button subclass uiview to override one of the touch methods like touchesended or change it to a uicontrol which can receive touch events like a uibutton but without the extra options for text shadows states etc

6586914
min	max
i can calculate the min and max lat longs and find the center point on where to center the map but i also need to calculate the zoom level programmatically

6586933
min	max
if you have an outlier in your data the standardize filter might hurt your data distribution as the min or max might be much farther than the other instances

6586954
versioning	upgrade
the reason for this setting existing is to allow companies who have internal sites designed for older versioning of ie to upgrade to a new versioning without breaking those sites

6587028
getter	setter
you can weasel your way around this by having auditinfo as a nested inner class within product and add getter and setter methods to product which set the fields on the auditinfo

6587059
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both require key events to be followed by blur event in order to call onchange

6587059
google-chrome	firefox
my understanding as to the reasoning for the blur event on google-chrome and firefox is to save resources but i disagree with that

6587077
width	height
essentially i am trying to create a simple web based image viewer using css3 transforms for rotate and scale and would like a containing div with fixed width height to be able to scroll to see the full content of the image it contains

6587085
width	height
hovering over an image would display a dot on the right side of the image which can be dragged thus changing the width of the image height would update proportionally

6587630
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you could use a single uiviewcontroller with different full screen views being showed hidden but i don t really see the point of doing it that way the uinavigationcontroller will also feel familiar for your users where a custom solution might not

6587636
implements	extends
you can implements multiple interfaces but not extends multiple classes

6587665
width	height
assuming that both imageview1 and imageview2 have no cropping the lines in the pictures are the diagonal of the imageview you could use the width and the height of both pic s to express both lines in formulas

form variables -- get post and to a lesser extent put delete

6588653

6588718
georss	kml
the google maps api supports the kml and georss data formats for displaying geographic information

6588718
georss	kml
these data formats are displayed on a map using a kmllayer object whose constructor takes the url of a publicly accessible kml or georss file

i have an asp.net4 page with viewstate enabled with a radiobuttonlist with 2 radio button a checkbox and an included usercontrol

6588822

button	checkbox	hide	show
the twist is that the code to show hide the checkbox based on what radio button is chosen lives in the onprerender event of the usercontrol

6588822
hide	show
so it does parent.findcontrol s to get the controls then hide show the checkbox based on the state of the radiobuttonlist

6588822

that is if the checkbox is checked then i click the radio button to hide it when i click the other radio button i want the checkbox to still be checked when it is now show

6588919

6588965
django	turbogears	turbogears	pyramid
note while the readme specifically mentions the pyramid web framework the core system would work just as well with a django turbogears or command line system

6589417
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox google-chrome and safari

you set the layout with setcontentview at the end of oncreate

6589443
oncreate	setcontentview
so you added the onclicklistener on the default listview and at the end of oncreate the default one was replaced with a new one because setcontentview was called

oncreate	setcontentview
to solve the problem move setcontentview at the top of oncreate

6589447

you place the channel_token client-side for opening the channel and keep the client_id secret on the server-side for transmitting messages to that client via the channel

6589707
getter	setter
if you are synthesizing properties then it is a lot easier to use the getter and setter and let them do the memory management for you

6589707
getter	setter
the exception being in your init dealloc methods where you should try to directly use the ivars to avoid any potential side effects of using the getter setter

6589707
getter	setter
by simply referencing things straight to seminarearray you are avoiding the getter setter you synthesized and therefore are responsible for all of your memory management

then the height adjusts itself according to the width

6589967

many-to-one	one-to-many
you seem to be assuming that there is some change in the behavior of delete rules between one-to-many and many-to-one but there isn t

6590002
many-to-one	one-to-many
if you think about it it has to be that way because a one-to-many is just the reciprocal relationship of a many-to-one

6590002
many-to-one	one-to-many
so every one-to-many relationship is just the flipside of a matching many-to-one relationship

6590227
gtk	clutter
i tried another example but this time using gtk instead of clutter and the following code actually works

this leads me to believe that the problem is not with the gjs implementation of cairo but with the gjs introspection methods for clutter cairo implementation

width	height
i have a defined fixed width and height to resize an image

6594089
width	height
in this case fixed width and height cause a problem

6594089
width	height
i want to calculate width and height in a smarter way

6594089
width	height
for example lets say i have defined width 1024px and height 768px

6594089
width	height
and i want to resize an image which is vertical height 1100px and width 200px

6594089
width	height
similarly if the image has the height 200px and the width 1100px

6594089
width	height
the third problem is that let s suppose if both height and width are more than the maximum height and maximum width let s say width 1100px and height 4000px

6594089
width	height
now since width and height both are more than the maximum width and maximum height but the image is vertical it will make it horizontal

6594117
inherited	properties
because of this i d create a view model that inherited from the actual class and then override the properties that needs remote validation

6594135
width	height
what you need is to maintain the width height ratio

6594135
width	height
originally you have an image of size wxh 500x1000 this width height ratio is 0.5

6594135
width	height
assuming you are changing 1000 to 768 in height your result width would be

6594135
width	height
another example 1800 x 1200 and your new height is 200 then your new width is 300 because 300 200 is 1.5 and 1800 1200 is also 1.5

since nsmutablearray is a subclassing of nsarray it inherited all its methods and declared properties so it publicly behaves like nsarray

6594829
gridview	repeater
you may have some code to bind data to the gridview control but this will not automatically bind anything to the repeater within the itemtemplate

6594837
width	height

creating and drawing a bitmapped image in memory is a cpu and memory-intensive task and so your absolute performance values may be skewed by the performance or lack thereof of the processors and memory subsystems causing inconsistent results across multiple platforms

6595003
width	height
you can assign any desired + - signs to those four points by choosing the appropriate rectangle. and 4 is a good guess for a number of dimensions for rectangles since you can specify any rectangle with x y of a certain corner along with width height

6595045
width	height
i agree with the image in absolute div with 100 width and height

6595045
width	height

6596169
equals	gethashcode
obviously this doesn t solve the entire problem and will only allow your proxy to forward calls to equals idummy and not equals object or gethashcode for that matter

6596202
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this code works very well with firefox safari and google-chrome but doesn t work in ie

superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
you get this by default with inherited all of the superclass s non-private properties methods and events are available to the subclassing

6596313
inherited	subclassing
inherited provides implementation details a method body to a subclassing whereas an interface does not

6596353
onclick	onchange
i was using the above code and when i clicked the second radio button i thought i should get two events one from the button that got unchecked and other from the button that got checked because logically speaking both buttons got their state changed and i have binded the onchange event not the onclick event

6596356
width	height
according to that article you might need to set an explicit height or width width 100

6596361
post	get
i got the post correct for posting statusses but i want to get the users mentions but im receiving could not authenticate with oauth the whole time

6596369
getter	setter
then if there is any custom logic in the getter setter i know it will be run

6596369
getter	setter
it is much safer to let the getter setter worry about all this logic any time you set your ivars

6596445
children	parent
i ve tried various combinations of views relationships and arguments with no luck other than getting the correct price tags on the parent pages but not on their children

6596445
children	parent
i ve also tried adding the price tag nodes as children of the parent node and using the parent node id argument supplied to views by the node hierarchy module

6596446
groupbox	panel
i found out that am placing the control in multiple controls on the form is a panel inside the panel is different groupbox these group boxes have the controls am trying to trap their events

6596448
yacc	bison
for that you need a yacc bison program which does not come included with visual studio 2010

6596488
mouseup	mousedown
if you are looking for an event that fires repeatedly while the button is held down you are out of luck but you can use the mousedown event to repeatedly perform an action and stop when the mouseup event is triggered

6596488
setinterval	clearinterval
for example you could use the setinterval function to repeatedly call a function while the mouse button is down and then use clearinterval to stop when the mouse button is released

6596500
post	get
because when it wants to send the post data or get data back to the server it simply uses the name attribute as the key of the parameter and the value of the currently selected radio button which has that name attribute as the value of the sent parameter

6596551
hide	show
drawloadingimage and removeloadingimage would show and hide a superimposed div with a placeholder image on top of the plot

6596575
int	chars
- the type you wish to use the allocator for is of very small size built-in types like chars short int etc.

6596584
mouseup	mousedown
mousedown mouseup click

6596584
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
what you probably want to do is receive mousedown set a timer and if neither mouseup or mousemove occur within some time invoke some behaviour

6596605
serializable	deserialization
your passed message looks more like some deserialization of xsd it can be possible because datatable can transfer its description as part of its serializable data

6596642
pop-up	dialog
services event logger message box open save dialog pop-up

6596654
keydown	keyup
the functions keydown and keyup would look like this

6596832
post	get
i have seen lots of post about how it s not possible to set the position but nothing on whether or not it s possible to get the position

6596841
width	height
however without specifying the width and height these won t display

6596841
width	height
this would have me specifying a fixed width and height for each of the images which i guess would work for a static webpage

6596841
width	height
however because these images are generated dynamically with jquery and are user submitted images differ in width and height each time

6596841
width	height
my question is if there is a way to do this with css only to have the width of containing the image being passed on to the before on this li so that the before and after pseudo-elements inherit the width and height of the orginal element

6596861
filtering	grouping
you are already grouping by what i think are the right fields and your where clause will apply the categoryid filtering for you

6596981
actionlink	redirecttoaction
i could specify direct urls like customer 23 approve instead of using actionlink and redirecttoaction but would rather stick to functions provided by mvc

6596993
webclient	httpwebrequest
the simplest way would be to create a webclient object and call its downloadstring method although if you need anything other than a simple request response you may have to use httpwebrequest to craft your request

6597023
webclient	httpwebrequest
you can use httpwebrequest class or webclient class its in system.net namespace

6597068
crypt	salt
to decrypt the stream you first need to remove the header added by crypt cbc s salt mode

6597069
post	get
edit this has been answered i no longer wish to post the url to my site.hoping this is ok and it does not get voted down to much -

6597171
post	get
the traditional way would be to pass a session identifier in get and post requests though that suffers from serious security risks

6597171
post	get
i could think of a more roundabout way of using ajax and client-side storage to request session-specific bits of data from the client s runtime but it d all boil down to url parameters in a get post request.

6597177
post	get
we used soap and post get web services in .net for our applications

6597243
implements	extends
i spend a day now for searching how to implements these right and extends it with more informations

6597256
post	get
use the regular html form controls so you don t get any post back on user input

6597262
post	get
hello you can use soap or post or get all of this webservices are being used in iphone.

6597291
opera	firefox
i m trying to understand why my css functions in opera but does not in firefox

6597326
fseek	fread
overloading fopen fseek fread in the case of wchar_t bothers me immensely

6597381
bazaar	git
use bazaar shelve --destroy to shelve the changes a-la git stash and kill them

6597441
implements	extends
public class v19 extends activity implements ontouchlistener

6597464
sequence	permutation
permute the bits in a non-obvious way a fixed permutation is probably fine but if you want something more sophisticated you could use something like george marsaglia s xorshift algorithm that produces a psuedorandom sequence of integers that only repeats after a very long cycle

6597489
opera	firefox
on another note if your having troubles with only firefox or only opera you can do something like this to code css for each specific browser may be helpful once you better know the issue

6597493
express	node.js
i have a node.js express app that queries a mysql db within the route and displays the result to the user

6597505
textview	imageview
in my xml layoutfile for the listitems i have an imageview and a textview

6597515
client-side	server-side
it does not matter if you are doing it server-side with php or client-side with javascript -- you must escape any input you receive before you turn it into output

6597551
carrierwave	paperclip
i recommend the usage of an external plugin such as paperclip or carrierwave

6597587
setinterval	settimeout
if i use setinterval or settimeout for an animation the speed of the animation is different in all the browsers but if i use the jquery timer plugin its the speed is almost exactly the same in every browser

case of an std ostringstream is full

6597681
express	node.js
i m connecting with a wcf httpclient to a node.js http server express

6597685
int	chars
the other is to use the slice operator to get the last 4 chars and interpret that remainder as a hexadecimal int

6597689
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should probably use mouseenter og mouseleave for each function

6597692
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested this in firefox 5 ie 9 google-chrome 12 and safari 5 and opera 11.5

6597692
versioning	upgrade
i ve written a workaround to use in my application until i can upgrade to a more recent versioning of jquery

6597696
hide	show
keyword and have it hide them all except the current one that was clicked and then show the current one by using the this keyword

6597707
int	chars
though perhaps it can be made more efficient to store chunks in int long and do int arithmetic than store it in chunk of chars

6597731
width	height
their width and height are explicitly set to 0

6597783
doc	rtf
for example our dxrichedit control is able to work with rtf docx doc and many other formats

6597797
slideup	slidedown
in jquery mobile page transition effect is accomplished by setting data-transition properties i.e slideup slidedown etc

6597847
profiling	instrumentation
i used instrumentation to profiling the performance and this is what i got the functions which drain the most performance are either from the physics engine farseer or the exen xna wrapper functions they call notably vector2.max vector2.min

6597865
nginx	lighttpd
nginx and lighttpd have similar solutions.

6597877
unbind	hoverintent
first you oculd use the hoverintent plugin which will ignore quick mouseovers or you could unbind the mouseover action until the animation is complete

6597912
hide	show
you show your real target and hide its siblings which aren t needed

6597929
websphere	ibm
which is it trying to recover but can t see ibm - websphere application server fails to start with xaexception xaer_rmerr xa_recover

6597975
margin	word-spacing
if the design is incredibly pixel perfect you can remove the actual word-spacing between the inline-blocks by removing the whitespace in the html or by giving them a negative right margin of about 0.25em

6597999
rvm	bundler
the problematic server is using rvm bundler so i m assuming it s somehow related the other one is vanilla ruby

6598005
post	get
i tried to get all changes to the root node only before and had to post process it

6598007
width	height
i would recommend setting specific height width in your css and then using jquery to replace the images as the page loads

6598059
submit	submission
but i ve got an html form submission data to a java backend which handles the data and submit it to the database

6598068
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it leads me to believe it s occurring because you shouldn t use a uitabbarcontroller as a viewcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller stack

6598147
cpu	processors
this has nothing to do with the processors and assigning resources the tool you use is simply not designed to use all i guess 4 cores of the cpu

6598195
atomic	compare-and-swap
i don t need more than atomic read operation and atomic write operations i have no use for fetch-and-add compare-and-swap etc.

6598202
for-loop	loops
and the performance will reach 100 on that core in case your program only do a for-loop or other kind of loops

6598214
ant	maven
using ant the classes get built to the correct folder webapp web-inf classes but it fails to do so with any maven configuration i ve tried to far

6598265
integer	unsigned
i am using mpir 2.4.0 on windows msvc 2010 and i was trying to add an unsigned 64bit integer to a mpz_t number

6598267
folder	directory
copy views-view-field.tpl.php to your theme folder from the views module directory under theme

6598327
fontfamily	font-size
for example in a css file when you type font omni completion could show the expected values font-style font-variant font-weight font-size line-height fontfamily

6598336
post	get
you may have to fiddle around with it some more to get everything working exactly as you want but i was able to create wcf service for biztalk to accept a very simple http post

6598338
maven	m2e
personally i use maven and eclipse with the m2e plugin

6598354
post	get
if you had access then you could have post a message to get access to the events

6598389
google-chrome	firefox
it displays perfectly in google-chrome 12 and firefox 5 but in ie 9 it looks like this

6598483
uiview	subviews
for uiview subviews in self.subviews

6598524
icmp	udp
i asked about icmp packets but another alternative would be udp packets if i could set the ttl

6598537
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller - uiviewcontroller - uiviewcontroller

6598636
maven	m2e
you may want to look at the gwt maven plugin which says integrate nicelly into eclipse thanks to m2e and google eclipse plugins.

6598711
post	get
in order for the model binder to see your myfield value is to pass it in the get post parameters and to do this you have to explicitly tell your view s form to pass the value in via html.hiddenfor

6598711
post	get
there s no way for the view to automatically know to send that property in the post get parameters

6598711
post	get
it is better to re-retrieve this data from the database if this data is going to be used for anything in the controller because even though it s read only on the html form users can still set this value to anything they want by manipulating the post get data

6598731
pull	push
for xml streams saxon has its own internal push pull interfaces receiver and pullprovider respectively and there are classes that map both of these to from the corresponding java and .net interfaces

6598740
vb.net	vb6
visual studio has a wizard that allows you to convert vb6 into vb.net which you could then reference in your c# project and use

6598764
for-loop	arrays
and i d like to use a simple for-loop to load images from the values in the galimgs arrays like so

6598786
google-chrome	firefox
for example this code works fine in firefox but breaks in google-chrome 12.0.742.112

6598801
openssl	opensc
i could use the openssl library but to support pkcs11 you need to wire up through an engine opensc have one but then it starts getting very big

6598835
getter	setter
right now i m writing a class that will provide getter and setter methods and am stuck on a design issue

6598854
interpreted-language	compiled-language
php is an interpreted-language as is not as efficient as java c or other compiled-language

6598893
getter	setter
in python you should prefer not to use getter and setter at all

6598893
getter	setter
the point of getter and setter in other languages is for encapsulation and for future-proofing in case you need to add logic to the getter or setter

6598946
fadein	hide
and voila when the div makes the fadein effect it starts going up and down of course the cpu usage goes up so when i press the button again to hide the div i revert the css to reduce cpu usage and improve performance

6598947
getter	setter
generally in python it s very bad style to use explicit getter setter methods

6598975
int	boolean
mostly the language deals in strings but i need to support boolean and numbers int and decimal as well

6598982
opera	firefox	post	get
in firefox and opera one can create a custom search engine but it passes along the search as a standard get or post variable

6598988
maven	pom.xml
i am using the eclipse plugin for maven to generate eclipse projects from maven pom.xml files

6599012
post	get
another approach to consider would be using the post method rather than the get method for your request

6599066
width	margin
you need to set a width to your div and add the margin css property shown below

6599098
post	get
when you get or post this

6599103
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i can capture all the events for touches on all the subviews when i put touchesbegan touchesmoved etc in the uiviewcontroller class

6599141
opera	google-chrome
if you look at the live css through firebug or google-chrome s dev tools or ie s or opera s dragonfly the rule just isn t there

6599153
uiview	subviews
the image can be zoomed in out so the line has to respond to that as well which is why having another uiview as a subviews won t work for me

6599161
submit	submission
i would suggest you use the submit and not the click on the button as you can place preventdefault and return false in the function to stop the button from submission

6599262
filtering	grouping
the filtering of your search objectclass grouping

6599303
pull	push
since binaries aren t stored in delta for most of them and aren t compressed as well as text file if you are storing rapidly evolving binaries you end up quickly with a large repository which becomes much cumbersome to move around push pull

6599343
portrait	landscape
i have a navigation controller within the same nib that can be set to landscape but this ends up looking awkward in interface builder as the nav controller is set to landscape but the containing window is in portrait

6599363
versioning	upgrade
it still works in ie7 ie8 so i m trying to find out if i just simply need to upgrade my versioning of extjs or if it is a configuration error on my part

6599364
google-chrome	firefox
ps if this would be easier more efficiently done in firefox or some other browser rather than google-chrome that is fine as well

6599383
versioning	upgrade
i m in need to have more than 1 synonym for a search term in magento versioning 1.4.2.0 - can t upgrade it for now but all my attempts to add multiple synonyms have failed

6599416
min	max
while not strictly mathematical operations you can use the javascript math object s functions max and min to do this

6599437
actionscript	mxml
flex also includes mxml which is declarative language and may be easier to digest if you don t know understand actionscript

6599499
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow	uiview	uiwindow
basically you have one instance of uiwindow that s hosting all your uiviewcontroller and uiview as part of the view hierarchy

6599499
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
for more information read up the developer documentation on uiwindow and uiviewcontroller which provide a great explanation on the differences

6599535
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in all of the browser i tried ie8 google-chrome firefox ..i tried with clearing cache restart apache server..but problem is still there

6599548
unsigned	short
i have plenty of indices that would fit a unsigned short but they are represented as int in java

6599581
put	get
depending on your needs you can search replace those tags or put the string you get from the server into uiwebview

6599596
unsigned	short
in java an unsigned short can be represented as a char

6599596
int	chars
just cast the int to chars and use putchar on the bytebuffer

6599613
pop-up	dialog
and thus to trigger a new pop-up dialog

6599620
oncreate	ondestroy
i handle the oncreate ondestroy events and initialise tear down any global variables in those functions

6599620
oncreate	ondestroy
my implementation is slightly different in that i have a java activity which then calls into the ndk code during the oncreate ondestroy functions but you may be able to directly override nativeactivity oncreate but i don t know as i haven t tried this

6599738
rss	feed
i have a php script that generates an rss feed using some external data it retrieves

6599740
cos	sin
in mathspeak that would be ob oa cos theta + oaxn sin theta

6599743
folder	directory
i managed to solve a similar problem by making the entire path to the database at least from your home directory readable and executable in addition to making the folder the db is in readable and writeable

6599794
macports	homebrew
i installed clojure and clojure contrib manually through homebrew and macports all of them gives me this error

6599797
traceroute	packets
when i do traceroute from one solaris m c to another using 10 gig network interface it takes 0.073 ms for 40 bytes packets

6599831
google-chrome	firefox
the font looks different in google-chrome than firefox

6599831
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see between help and the margin in google-chrome are 33px and in firefox 57px

6599835
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works on google-chrome and safari but try it on firefox

6599852
screens	tablet
i m looking into writing an application to act as a joypad on a touch screens tablet running windows 7 written in c# .net

6599859
pull	push
once it s done push pull will be exposed by objective-git

6599874
hide	show
this whole form is in a table format and that is not about to change so i guess the easiest approach would be to show hide a cell but i have no idea how to connect that to a specific option being selected

6599889
retaincount	dealloc
this will end up with an instance variable with a retaincount of only 1 so when you dealloc the object it won t leak

6599900
getter	setter
it is often recommended to access the ivars directly in the init and dealloc method to avoid any side effects caused by setter getter

6599900
getter	setter
throughout your class you will want to use the kvc setter getter or dot notation to set objects like this

6599901
icmp	tcp
icmp and tcp are way different protocols

6599904
google-chrome	firefox
pop up your javascript console shift-ctrl-j in google-chrome firefox and you ll see the error

6599910
google-chrome	firefox
i am working on a javascript application that works in firefox and google-chrome but breaks in internet explorer 7

6599913
rundll32	shell32.dll
if my java app is running under windows i can call runtime.getruntime .exec rundll32 shell32.dll shellexec_rundll + filename

6599931
width	height
specify a height and width for the image in the img tag

6599931
width	height
this way you will be able to restrict the height and width of the image

6599934
installation	upgrade
to automatically remove older msi installation you can use the upgrade element with your old msi upgradecode

6599948
solaris	aix
gwt application not runs on windows linux solaris aix etc

6599949
hide	show
try attaching a function to the onchange event for the select using bind that checks the select s value using val and then hide show the text box accordingly using hide or show

6599953
maven	pom.xml
i ve tried changing my warname in pom.xml maven war plugin but that still didn t work

6599974
mp3	wav
you could upload the file example in the link ba__friend posted as a wav or simply the raw data and convert it to an mp3 on your server

6599989
submit	submission
however when you submit a form the page is torn down and replaced with the result of the form submission

6599989
submit	submission
alternatives are to avoid doing the ajax request entirely or to cancel the form submission wait for the ajax response even though you don t care about it and then submit the form programmatically via htmlformelement#submit mdash

6600012
serializable	deserialization	getter	setter
now this serializable fine but in deserialization uses getteams presumably because jackson sees a getter with a mutable list and thinks it can use it as a setter

6600012
getter	setter
so what i d like to do is annotate getteams so that it s never used as a setter but is used as a getter

6600043
google-chrome	firefox
it seems like ie firefox and google-chrome just ignore the version 1 from what i can tell in fiddler

6600067
rss	feed
i ve got a system that fetches a few hundred rss feed

6600067
rss	feed
find the average time-between-updates interval variance of the rss feed and put them in a bucket this one updates every 3 mins so do a check every 1 minute

6600080
apache	nginx
use an apache in worker mode or nginx and get php out of the webserver with php-fpm

6600137
bash	zsh
p and pe should work in both bash zsh if it does not please let me know in #beginrescueend on irc.freenode.net

6600138
post	get
if you are doing rest with json you still need to send query params for gets and you must not convert all your gets to post to get round this issue

6600147
prawn	pdfkit
after some research it seems prawn or pdfkit is the way to go

6600161
children	parent
you can do this by iterating through each parent and then manipulate its children

6600176
profiling	instrumentation
i traced with instrumentation time profiling image below and uiscrollview is the culprit

6600185
width	height
in order for the scaling up to work i need to give a very big width height like 150dp 150dp

6600185
width	height
if the width height of the layout is smaller than 150dp the whole layout is filled and the image loses it s aspect ratio

6600198
rss	feed
though it s only part of the solution you can also if the feed is served over http check the cache-control and expires headers of the rss feed for hints on how often you should fetch the feed

6600218
nsstring	nsdata
-use mfmailcomposeviewcontroller which does allow image attachments via - void addattachmentdata nsdata attachment mimetype nsstring mimetype filename nsstring filename

6600247
post	get
one is a web service spider and the other is a web app yet to be developed the web app will make requests to the crawler using get post and the usual stuff

6600317
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m able to view my files fine in safari google-chrome and firefox but not ie which we all know ie isn t the greatest because i m using some html5 stuff

6600338
hash	md5
therefore theoretically only sha1 and md5 should differ in the hash that is produced

6600401
next	except
so far i have written a subclass of my importer that simply intercepts the web requests before it actually calls the url in question and tests that all the inputs are of the right type and form and this works fine in all cases except where the perl script needs to read the response for instructions and then proceed to the next steps

6600410
integer	unsigned
is sign-extending right shift when the left operand is a signed integer and is zero-extending right shift when the left operand is an unsigned integer

6600410

6601424
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
my first approach was to create a new nsarraycontroller bound to an custom property of my nstreecontroller object iderived a class for that but that property only called once and not updated anymore after that

6601616
hash	md5
it will always be the output of the md5 hash

6601687
multiplying	add
you can add the bytes or multiplying their ascii values to generate a number which you can the use as your cut-off

6601694
unsigned	short
assuming the two bytes are an unsigned big-endian short i would do the following

6601694
unsigned	short
h is an unsigned short

6601892
super	implements
use jquery cookie plugin is super simple to implements

6601917
cpu	affinity
do one call with a mask that sets affinity to one cpu and then do a second call to restore the original mask

6601917
cpu	affinity
this code probes one cpu at a time until setting affinity works in this case we now know the original mask

6601992
integer	unsigned
mutablefetchresults count likely is this so it yields an unsigned integer

6601992
integer	unsigned
it will wrap around to the max value of an unsigned integer and your i will also be promoted to an unsigned type

6602036
qlist	qvector
qlist qlinkedlist and qvector provide similar functionality

width	height
when experimenting with designing your path drawing it s helpful to set the path element s height width first

6602320
width	height
for whatever reason it is fine with being toggled by javascript. i could use gsize width height but it cannot handle percentages

6602370
qlist	qvector
so i would suggest using qlist until profiling suggests changing to a qvector

6602372
goto	break
in practice it is sometimes in rare cases useful to use goto to resolve complex flow of control scenarios where normal if else break while for structures would be more nested or convoluted than necessary

6602372
goto	break
the best good use of a goto that i can think of right now is to break out of a deeply nested set of loops without the overhead of additional conditional checks on each loop iteration

6602421
puts	gets
i think the way to do it in qt is to use a timer which fires at regular intervals and connect the signal to the slot representing your function that gets the new image and puts it in the widget

6602427
hide	show
this works for me and i am using show and hide to make my div hidden visible

6602441

if i create the table as myisam and do an engine alter to innodb i get error 121

6602571
google-chrome	firefox
a good way to test that i use is to have a windows install in virtual box and reduce the memory to the common amount users would have 256mb really old 512 old 1024 a lot of users 2gb+ high end users and remember your target if your building a js heavy site do you want to support ie6 if not then your main target is windows vista or newer and as such a minimum of 512mb of ram is required just remember to test in the different browser firefox 3.x.x 4 5 ie 7 8 9 and google-chrome because different browser use different amounts of memory

pdu	smpp
we have been told by different telcos which data_encoding to use for submitting smpp pdu s to the smsc

6602901
pdu	smpp
the payload of the smpp pdu is submitted encoded and the data_coding parameter is set accordingly 0x00 for gsm 0x03 for latin-1 and 0x08 for ucs-2

6602901
pdu	smpp
does the smpp pdu payload need to be modified to contain a udh which specifies the locking shift table

6602934
stateless	stateful
http is a stateless protocol so the only way to fake a stateful interaction is for client and server to send a session identifier with every transaction

6602936
toolbar	tabs
i am not sure what you mean by the new syntax if your loading object dynamically the .add property is the way to go portlets loading items from json from state such as persistent tabs outlook like custom toolbar items

6602970
xna	slimdx
i don t know all if it s features but slimdx appears to give a more direct x feeling api for c# than xna though i have not used it i ve heard a lot about it

6602981
int	chars
if you don t need the result as a chars type then i think it would be best to cast the result as an int

6602995

macports	homebrew
well i couldn t make it work through fiddling with jars or using macports or homebrew

6603219
width	height
or alternatively make it as big as the scroll view width height and simply move it every time the scroll view moves. when the scroll view decides to pass on its touches to its subviews instead of dragging this will be the first thing hittested

6603262
opennlp	stanford-nlp

6603391
public	protected
change cook to a protected method cookimpl then have a public final method called cook

6603410
hash	md5
i d suggest you create an md5 hash of the json.stringify o and store that in your hashmap with a reference to your stored object as the data for the hash

6603410
hash	md5
if you find a match in the hash map then you compare the incoming object with the actual object that you ve stored to see if they are truly duplicates since there can be md5 hash collisions

6603410
hash	md5
that way you have a manageable hash table with only md5 hash in it

6603415
put	get
also put in a delete menu item on the activity you get to after selecting something from the listview

6603438
getter	setter
change the rendered conditions during action methods only and not inside setter getter or something

6603484
button	checkbox
in my view you should add checkbox to your list view and give a separate button for deleting items from list i mean to say that add a delete button in the layout in which your list view is also present and when user checks the item which he she wants to delete and click on the delete button the item which is checked by the user gets remove from list

6603499
folder	directory
if the executable was the only item in its folder i could get the application directory from the file class and go from there

6603548
post	get
the mixing of post get variables is considered as a poor form

6603576
getter	setter
in the mycontroller autowired works fine to pull in myservice without getter setter

6603576
getter	setter
but when i try to apply the autowired annotation to the myotherservice field of myservice i get an error saying it can t find a necessary setter method for myotherservice -- but it works if i fill in the getter and setter methods for this field

6603583
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i know this is a tangential answer but the exact same thing happened to me i abandoned sharpziplib and went to dotnetzip

6603609
google-chrome	firefox
however the firefox driver seems pretty stable - maybe you should stick with it until the google-chrome driver gets baked a bit more

6603619

sendmessage works fine for keyboard events but when i try using it to send mouse events its always sending mouse coordinates 0 0

6603648
mktime	strftime
try mktime 0 0 0 strftime d origtime date m +1 date y

6603672
folder	directory
what you described here just works one additional web custom folder for each additional virtual directory and add output of the target project to each one

6603712
boost	allocator
boost intrusive_ptr performs better than shared_ptr because it doesn t need a second allocator to hold the reference count

6603851
google-chrome	firefox
you can use firebug for firefox or the built in developer tools for google-chrome to view the javascript console

6603861

so just make sure to keep appending to your domdocument object between createelement calls

6603876

pop-up	dialog
i wanted to display a pop-up dialog in my website

6603952
hash	md5
now i can think of two numbers which give the same result and this is where this simple example differs from a proper cryptographic hash like md5 or sha1

6604034
post	get
for .net it uses get coming from a webpage but for java it uses post

6604041
put	get
get call as we did in the put

6604068
post	get
you ll find the link to do this in the admin console and the webscript that backs this is perform a get to fetch the spreadsheet template or a post to upload the users

6604090
uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton
then create your own custom status bar view at the top of the view with height 20px that is either a uibutton or simply a uiview with a uitapgesturerecognizer

6604146
createelement	each
as brian_d mentioned after each call to createelement you will need to call

6604255
addition	multiplication
you can extend the ideas of multiplication addition and exponentiation to a clock

6604255
hash	md5
people much smarter than me have engineered md5 and other hash to make them provably hard to reverse

6604255
hash	salt
that s the idea of a salt is that you make the hash function be slightly different for every user so he can t reuse a single set of precomputed values for all users

6604255
hash	md5
so for example if my password is shittypassword my hash might show up as md5 6n93nshittypassword and if your password is shittypassword your hash might show up as md5 fa9elshittypassword

6604255
hash	md5
when you try to login with the password x the computer can just calculate md5 fa9el +x and see if it matches the stored hash

6604255
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
so the basic mechanics of logging in remain unchanged but for an attacker they are now faced with a more daunting challenge rather than a list of md5 hash they are faced with a list of md5 sums and salt

6604255
hash	salt
they can ignore the fact that the hash are salt and try to crack the passwords with their lookup table as is

6604304
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
instead of using hasnextline method which is non-existent in a file object an alternative would be to access your file using an inputstream class like fileinputstream and wrapped inside a decorator class like bufferedreader which would allow you to read its contents per line using readline method..

6604309
int	chars
when the user is ready they click save which calls wcf to save this data in an encrypted chars string probably not more than 2 kb in size along with some int and short string fields

google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome and ie the image loads correctly but on firefox the images don t load

6604491
put	get	post	get	post	put
post is fully supported by the url your server redirects you to but the client is executing a get request when it behaves according to your setredirecting call curl does the same exact thing with the -l switch the fix is to either put a at the end of url or to grab the location header from the response yourself and then initiate another post request manually

6604583
many-to-many	one-to-many
since the user-has-a-server -relation is a one-to-many and not many-to-many relation a field in the users table would suffice

6604627
dictionary	map
on initialization you can set all the attributes then you can have your own custom attribute to read the values you previous set which can then map to a dictionary or something along those lines

6604639

getter	setter
a class can always access all its properties directly anyway providing getter and setter doesn t ensure protection at all like it does for access from outside the class

there are four methods you might consider loadview viewdidload viewwillappear and viewdidappear

6605842
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if you set up your animation in viewwillappear or viewdidappear you can be sure that your view s frame will be the proper dimension but you need to be careful with these methods because they can get called more than once after the view gets loaded and you don t want to add your whiteview subview more than once

6605848

if you haven t specified width or height but has specified element shifting on both directions element stretches to fill the available space

6605982
width	height
in case of a specified width or height value for the absolutely positioned element element shifting doesn t stretch the element

6605982

if you must use strtok to get the information make sure you strdup it and pass the copies to your other thread remembering to free them when done

6606007
free	malloc
and remember to free both those memory allocations in your other thread when it s finished with them normally i wouldn t advocate malloc -type operations for c++ but since you re already using character buffers rather than strings it seems the easiest solution

6606019
getter	setter
there are lots of people very happy to test their getter and setter and try to enforce that on others

6606045

6606296
postgresql	mysql
the same javascript code used in mysql works fine for firefox ubuntu but the buttons do nothing in postgresql version with firefox ubuntu

6606445
width	height
then resize the image width to the maximum width and calculate the height according to the maximum width limit

6606445
width	height
for example image width is 2248 and height is 532

6606445
width	height
the width exceeds but height is less

6606445
width	height
so reduce the width to maximum 1024 and calculate height which will be around 242

6606445
width	height
similarly resize the height to maximum height and calculate the width accordingly

6606445
width	height
height and width both exceeds the maximum height and maximum width

6606445
width	height
if the image is horizontal resize width to maximum width and calculate height according to that

6606445
width	height
else if the image is vertical or square resize height to maximum and calculate width according to that

firefox	safari
the problem then was file drag and drop which worked in safari but not in firefox due to restrictions in the browser

6611399

within your jar zip file go to the inf manifest.mf file there should be a line that looks like

6611401

i ve participated in writing large javascript application with both sproutcore and cappuccino and without any macroframework at all

6611441
sproutcore	cappuccino
big frameworks like cappuccino or sproutcore help you to avoid doing that

6611441
sproutcore	cappuccino
cappuccino is great for desktop-style apps while sproutcore has shifted focus in 2.0 to web style apps like new twitter while still giving you great ways to structure your apps and your code

6611441
sproutcore	cappuccino
both cappuccino and sproutcore apps can be tested right in the browser without the need for a web server

6611441
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore uses qunit cappuccino comes with ojunit ojspec

6611441

6611854
octal	decimal
because if you have a string number like 0700 and want the output to be integer 700 you need to inform parseint that it is a decimal number rather than octal

6611870
integer	radix
you might not always want to parse the integer into a base 10 number so supplying the radix allows you to specify other number systems

6611870
octal	binary
octal would be 8 binary would be 2 and so on.

6611926
public	protected
if your class does anything more than this than you should never use public or even protected fields

6611953
wordpress	joomla
i ve used wordpress and joomla for the majority of the sites i ve done but i found them a bit too bulky for my liking so i put together a cms called inline content management that is a simple php script that you can install on your site and with jquery front end it allows you to define editable divs and users who are allowed to edit these divs

6611985

the old-fashioned way to check is to look at the output of a hex dump or octal dump and verify that characters like ã are represented by the expected two-byte sequence

6612097
cvs	svn
the first is that it doesn t really strongly support revision control systems outside of cvs and svn very easily integrated into the gui

6612399
packets	pcap
i have to write a rtmp parser which will handle the packets captured form a rtmp stream on wireshark and i will extract the data from the pcap

6612399
packets	pcap
i have gone through the specs ad i am able to understand the handshake process and also able to locate the media in tcp packets but i am confused in case of multiple audio video session which are interleaved within a single pcap how we can handle that in the parsing so as make our parser able to parse multiple stream simultaneously

6612440
post	get
basically mvc will map the contents of a request post or get to a strongly typed object for you

6612441
sproutcore	cappuccino
you could also look at sproutcore and cappuccino again javascript frameworks

6612441
sproutcore	cappuccino
cappuccino is called objective-j and it looks like objective-c and sproutcore was used to build apples mobile me interface but both have moved on since then

6612441
sproutcore	cappuccino
cappuccino has a gui ide but not sure on sproutcore

6613432
postgresql	mysql
while i use php pdo in the frontend there are lots of queries that go like this which worked fine in mysql but in postgresql they have to be eighter or the tables after the migration should become with low case in postgresql then it would care for the double-quotes

6613444
post	get
in particular i m confused as it seems using restful methods makes it very difficult to interact with the service through a client webpage since you have to use ajax to submit anything other than the get post queries and if your service lives on a different server then it s nigh impossible because of the same origin policy

6614622
children	parent
your supposition is that every item directly knows both its children and its parent because the children collection and the parent reference are stored locally in fields

6614622
children	parent
it need not be the case that every item knows both its children and its parent

6614622
children	parent
another solution would be to have the universe contain a hash table that maps items to their parent and a second hash table that maps items to a list of their children

6614622
children	parent
in the real tree every item knows its children but not its parent

6614622
children	parent
when you ask that node for its children it makes a new facade node wrapped around each child and sets the parent property of the facade node to the node that was queried for its children

realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
what the c standard says is that you cannot use free for a normal pointers.it says free function performs its action when it is used with the dynamic memory allocation functions like malloc calloc and realloc .even though if you try to use a free by passing a normal pointer which is not involved with malloc calloc and realloc it results undefined behaviour it may lead to core dumped error or crash and the code is working with your compiler because the compiler might be developed in a different way example a student learning compiler that code works even with the turbo c but it really fails when you work on the cygwin or gcc compilers.i suggest you to work on cygwin and gcc compilers rather than other compilers because they give you very vast experience and knowledge even you can learn the concepts of multithreading

the reason i told you before but now let me tell you more clearly.remember these arpita the free does not work with normal pointers it only works with the pointers that are involved with malloc calloc and realloc .the free was developed in a way that it works only with dynamic memory allocation concepts.if you try to use it with a normal pointer it results segmentation fault or core dumped in linux based os it is because the function is defined in that way because you are trying to free a memory pointed by q but q is uninitialized you don t know the address it is pointing to and you don t even know the size of memory to be deallocate.so their lies the error.i hope you understood

the problem with rest is it s not always easy to map all operations of an object on the common http methods get post put delete options

6615130
put	get	post	get	post	put
obviously crud can be implemented by assigning the 4 crud operations on to the get post put delete methods

6615130
post	get
but you can also codify in the http body of the post method the kind of operation which is the minimalistic get post style of doing rest

6615130
post	put
the solution advocated by the crud style services is to emulate a put request by annotating a post request with a special http header

6615130
post	get
roy fielding who coined the term restful api mentions also that he think it is well possible to design a perfectly restful system with just get and post

6615130
post	put
adding rest to an existing mvc web application requires at least the implementation of an extra restful controller which translates the http method verbs put post delete into operations on the model object identified by the request uri but often also the implementation of a more machine-friendly view json xml ...

6617596
children	parent
question how can i sort parent by children names

6617598
portrait	landscape
as a solution i specified a fixed height for the list view and this works well in portrait mode however i have noticed that when i switched to landscape mode the listview would not scroll and the only reason i can come up with is that the number of items in the listview is less than the fixed height so the scrolling is not enabled

6617613
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome and opera it looks really bad

6617625
folder	directory
on windows i m not sure what it interprets that as by default but if i open up a command line and say cd desktop working directory being my user folder it says it can t find the path specified

hide	show
in my apps i tend to have some groups of views that i can move or hide show together in which case i collect them in a single parent view some that move or hide show alone in which case i obviously treat them singly and some that are so different from one orientation to the other that i keep alternates as you suggest

6618078
getter	setter
there is sometimes a need for getter and setter but even then i would hide them to the outside world

6618078
getattr	setattr
there are plenty of ways to do this in python getattr setattr __getattribute__ etc... but a very concise and clean one is

6618078
getter	setter
here s a brief article that introduces the topic of getter and setter in python

6618083
move	drag
drag drop them to the folder automatically move them

6618117
getter	setter
using properties lets you begin with normal attribute accesses and then back them up with getter and setter afterwards as necessary

6618120

innodb	myisam
i ve read that this can be done without issue using myisam as it is the default behavior but i m using innodb so need a trigger for such

6618155
getter	setter
i feel like properties are about letting you get the overhead of writing getter and setter only when you actually need them

6618155
getter	setter
java programming culture strongly advise to never give access to properties and instead go through getter and setter and only those which are actually needed

6618155
getter	setter
do not use getter and setter at first when if they not needed

6618157
hide	show
content script to show hide div

6618163
min	max
then i determine the min and max of each block and draw a zig-zag line from min to max to min to max.

6618176
getter	setter
at the same time you don t have to write getter and setter for everything just in case you might need to better control access later

6618184
getter	setter
in python you don t use getter or setter or properties just for the fun of it

6618184
getter	setter
there is indeed a lot of code with extension .py that uses getter and setter and inheritance and pointless classes everywhere where a simple tuple would do but it s code from people writing in c++ or java using python

6618207

since your coming from the extension context browser action button you need to use message passing to transfer commands to show hide to the dom

6618248
hide	show
you need to send a message asking it to show or hide the overlay you wanted

6618248
hide	show
listen on extension requests from the content script using chrome.extension.onrequest.addlistener when you receive a show or hide command from the extension you can add remove the dom

onfocus	onblur
to tell if one of your text fields is focused add onfocus and onblur handlers to the text fields you want to watch and handle state changes in the onfocus handler

6618554
onfocus	onblur
a shorter easier way to add onfocus and onblur handlers would be to use jquery but since no mention was made i wrote for a small simple implementation

6618554
mouse	keyboard
also be careful when altering the default behavior of keyboard and mouse events as you can hamper accessibility devices that rely on behavior you yourself may not be able to test with

when i specify text-align center for an element with a width that is greater than the width of the text the text is centered within the content box of the element as expected

6618648
width	text-align
when i specify text-align center for an element with a width that is less than the width of the text the text is aligned to the left edge of the content box and overflows the right edge of the content box

6618684

answer to question #1 if you extend a class with another all public and protected methods will be available in the sub-class without re-defining them

6618799
strlen	strcpy
i m willing to bet that your strcpy 3 calls here have written outside the bounds of the memory you ve allocated strlen 3 does not account for the 0 terminator at the end of c strings so your and are allocated one-byte-too-short

6618826
int	chars
riff subchunks have an 8-byte header 4 bytes for an identifier name field which is traditionally filled with human-readable ascii chars fmt and a 4-byte little-endian unsigned int specifying the number of bytes in the subchunk s data payload -- the subchunk s data payload follows immediately after its 8-byte header

6618836
hash	salt
i assume this to be related to the same principle that is applied in password-based encryption pkcs#5 - because the domain of passwords does not provide enough entropy simply hashing passwords doesn t add any additional entropy - that s why you need to salt passwords before you hash them

6618836
prng	random
one simple example that finally convinced me suppose you have a very bad prng that will always produce a random number of 1

cos	sin
from what i understand you take the vector of where you want to go say x direction no rotation that would be 1 0 0 and multiply that with sin cos matrix then you get how much each particular motor should be powered to generate motion in that direction

6619222
cos	sin
in order to double check the results i calculated for velecoties for 1 0 0 that gives me a b c d 4 motor speeds and i have 4 î s when i add each wheels sin and cos components i think i shoudl get back to 1 0 0 but i actualy get back something like 2.5 0 0

now the system normally should scale for this on an hdpi screens by a factor of 1.5 unless you supposedly you set a density in the bitmap object but i don t really know how that works but since you used the method setimagebitmap the bitmap is not scaled leading to your problem

squash	merge
if you want to keep a - b - c in the history don t squash - just git merge

6620015

6620071
disk	ram
you can drastically speed up some algorithms by using caching making them cache-oblivious avoiding bottlenecks by working with ram instead of disk using parallelization or doing work ahead of time -- these techniques are often independent of the order-of-growth big-o notation though you will often see the number of cores in the big-o notation of parallel algorithms

6620071
quicksort	mergesort
in practice even among algorithms which have the same or similar asymptotic performance their relative merit may actually be driven by other things such as other performance factors quicksort and mergesort are both o n log n but quicksort takes advantage of cpu caches

an easy solution for maintaining a ratio is to use width height and scalex y together

6620279
iboutlet	ibaction
simply create an iboutlet in the class where your ibaction is and bind the iboutlet to you button

6620339
width	height
i think you should add css style for #popupcompare before getting its height and width

6620401

is there any image inside popup as resizing popup width would result in resized width of image and eventually resized image height

6620422

filtering	grouping
i cannot work out how to filtering out which users get rendered into the index view based on which grouping the users not the the currently logged user belong.

6620575
width	height
the problem is that the height and width of the component are apparently not available until after being rendered by the popup manager

6620575
width	height
but i do not know any way of finding out when the popup is actually rendered and therefore the height width values available

6620575

6620665
range	minimum
minimum blog range is a constant that i set

6620678
post	get
if you can use a get instead of post to send the user s values to the server i d hijack the default html post form submit by using jquery to attach a click handler to the submit button and in that click handler read your form values append them to some url var and then call this to actually perform the redirect

6620685
put	get
to put this character in a url using java then yes you use urlencoder and you will get e5 a4 a7

6620733
width	height
for setting the location of component i have used the height width left top property of components

6620749
width	height
the first method could be made into more flexible one by using actual tag so that you force the image to be specific height and width

6620756
tinyint	boolean
tinyint 1 will map to boolean

6620756
tinyint	boolean
bit will map to boolean as well but when exporting bit with mysqldump will look like 0 so i recommend tinyint 1 which will look like 0 or 1

tinyint	boolean
you can use bool boolean in mysql which is a synonym for tinyint 1

6620808
initializer	class-method
i would like to make a data manager class that retrieves data from plist and i wonder if i should make a class with all class-method which read plist every time when the method is called and returns requested value or create a class initializer which initializer an array instance variable with the plist data and all methods are instance methods which get data from the array

i am new to https ssl

6620983

6620990
rss	feed
i display set of string from rss feed in textview formate

6621003
zsh	tcsh	bash	tcsh	bash	zsh

you could also use acra or a service like bugsense that solve this problem

6621164
postgresql	mysql
i use postgresql a lot and the code is different from when you re working with mysql

6621164
postgresql	mysql

6621177
google-chrome	safari
i have a video tag which working fine in safari google-chrome but not on ipad iphone

6621194

content-length 1 content-type

6621543
google-chrome	safari

portrait	landscape
when i load it it looks fine but when i turn it to say to landscape from portrait it doesn t go where the coordinates tell it

6621620

what i want is to hide the inherited methods from the handle class so that only the function the user is allowed to use is show under methods

6621876
int	chars
my problem is when i use this schema.ini the 9th 10th and 11th column of the second row of the csv file doesn t read properly if there s a special chars in it it supposed to be telphone number i think because the row above is returned as a number int because it s pure numeric

6621882
int	double
there was already a perfectly good way of doing int powers with double and then simply converting back to an int giving you the ability to check for int overflow and underflow before converting

6621943
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization doesn t work cause it also copies the read only part

6621980
width	text-align
since a is an inline element it never takes up more width than it needs and text-align is rendered useless

6621981
cpu	processors
cpu id is unique to each processors type - can not be changed

6622105

firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all of this works well in firefox 5 opera 11.5 google-chrome 12.0.742.112 safari 5.0.5 7533.21.1 i personally do not feel it is up to developers to try and fix the problem i feel it is up to microsoft to make their browser more compatibly compliant

6622916
portrait	landscape
when i try to take the snapshot in any portrait landscape mode it comes inverted rotated to 180 degree

6622943

6622947
int	chars
it takes an int number of chars

6622960
salt	md5
how about putting all the images in a public directory configured not to have directory listing and use very long and random filenames generated with md5 for example from an id and some salt that is tracked in a database and the filename changed after each access

6622962
int	chars
the type of the member variables are not the same mainly int bool chars etc no need to overload operator and the member variable name could be named with anything no rule to follow

6622977
width	height
uiviewcontentmodescaleaspectfill makes the image fill the view so extra width or height not both will be cropped off

6623003
folder	directory
i could also recommend having your images stored in a non public folder that the web server has write access to and then creating a symlink without write access and directory listing in the public folder to this image folder and load the images from there

6623017
hide	show
use 2 different datagrid controls one for apps and one for servers and hide show when needed

6623077
opencv	emgucv
any gdi+ or emgucv opencv solutions are good for me

6623117
charindex	substr
how do you find index of a character or position of a substr in sqlite without charindex and patindex function

6623304
background-color	transparency
but the background-color of #foo may return transparency even if one of its parents declared a colored background

6623307
hex	binary
aside postgresql actually has a uuid data type but no built-in uuid function which just means you don t have to re- hex the field in order to avoid getting binary garbage in your terminal on select

6623310
google-chrome	firefox
if the user select a file and then select the same file again bu opening the file dialog again google-chrome doesn t fire the onchange event while firefox does

6623456
for-loop	arrays
remove that for-loop just return the arrays

6623479
margin	height
the problem occurs when you set height 100 for inner divs with margin 5px

6623479
margin	height
you must set margin of a div on percentage basis and reduce the height of inner divs accordingly

6623511
hide	show
if you need variable column types the simplest route is to include multiple columns and show and hide them appropriately

6623532
fadein	fadeout
depending on how complex is the class if it has images in the background different font types etc.. i think a way you can achieve this effect is by duplicating the element leaving one hidden and then use the fadein and fadeout effects

6623535
jar	war
the new war has the same layout as the old war the only difference is that the ejb jar s can now be placed inside the web-inf lib folder of the war

6623564
versioning	upgrade
my xcode versioning is currently 4 and i want to upgrade to ios 5

6623581
versioning	upgrade

6623592
tablet	hdpi	tablet	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi

6623607
viewdidload	viewdidappear
you could implement viewdidappear on your questionviewcontroller and set the text there instead of viewdidload

6623614
superclass	subclassing
the answer depends on what the superclass method does and what the subclassing method does

6623641
salt	md5
i wouldn t use md5 but sha1 instead but even using md5 without salt already increases the security in your form dramatically

6623642
fadein	fadeout
you can supply a callback function to fadeout and call fadein in the callback

6623662
ia-32	x86
regarding the x86 architecture the best resource to read is intelâ 64 and ia-32 architectures software developerâ s manual chapter 8.2 memory ordering

6623769
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried simply to use though that doesn t work in firefox google-chrome

6623771
innodb	myisam
yes the data should be consistent in the db if many threads are writing at the same time - anyway you will have to take care in code of managing the transactions correctly - and of course use innodb as the storage engine for mysql because myisam does not permit transactions

6623775
mousemove	mousedown
how can i combine the mousedown and mousemove events so that when i hover and hold down the mouse button the textbox value dynamically changes as i move

6623812
stderr	fflush
by default stderr is unbuffered which is why you don t need to fflush it

6623835
mouseup	mousedown
track the mousedown and mouseup events to set a variable determining whether or not the mouse button is pressed ie set in down unset in mouseup then just check this variable in mouse_move

6623906
opera	firefox
at the moment i have hacked it using rgba as that affects ie8 but it also affects older opera and firefox browsesrs too so not ideal and looks rubbish

6623953
nexus	artifactory
however maven relies on the fact that it will have a central repository either maven central or your own repository - nexus artifactory etc. from which to download the plugins and dependencies it needs

typically when i represent a parent child hierarchy i have a table as follows i might also add additional depth columns to speed things up where parent and children are both foreign key relationships to rows from the same entity table

6624095
listview	gridview
i believe the gallery view is missing a lot of functionality or is broken as compared to listview or gridview

6624106
put	get
i have managed to get the data from the json loop through the put them into a textview add onclick on the textview

6624161
width	height
therefore if you want the circle to remain circular as the content expands you need to dynamically adjust the height to match the width

6624161
width	height
in this case you should fix the height and width of the circle and give the content position absolute

6627178
int	chars
now the problem is that c99 defines bool as _bool and _bool is even not necessarily same size as int in fact in my experience on most platforms in nowadays it is often same size as unsigned chars not to talk about being same type which is actually impossible as _bool is a builtin type of the language in c99 but defines false and true as 0 and 1 without any typecast and preprocessor definitions without a typecast will default to int

6627294
cvs	rcs
i guess for cvs you can even work directly on the rcs files but i am not very experienced with cvs

6627679
cassini	iis
inability to serve wcf with wshttpbinding is not a limitation of simpleworkerrequests but rather of wcf s assumption that whenever it s hosted in an asp.net appdomain then it s hosted either iis or original cassini and nothing else

6627695
int	boolean
since all the boolean operations still evaluate to type int all the pre-c99 compilers can be updated to support c99 without having to change their type-evaluation code for all the basic operators and the standard-writers can be more confident that the new boolean feature hasn t accidentally introduced inconsistencies to parts of the standard that had previously been fine

6631798
g++	gcc
which we can prove by separately compiling with gcc and linking with g++ to pull in the right libraries

6631801
nltk	lingpipe
alternatively the stanford parser can do the same stuff and might be a bit quicker being java based or lingpipe but nltk is waaaaaay more user friendly

versioning	upgrade
that is to say versioning 3 has no idea how to upgrade from versioning 1 to 2 but it does know how to upgrade from versioning 2 to 3

6632143
versioning	upgrade
or if the new versioning is versioning 5 and you re at versioning 1 you run the script to upgrade from 1 to 2 then 2 to 3 then 3 to 4 and finally from 4 to 5

6632161
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

6632679
width	height

in my application i d like to forward mouse and keyboard events to an invisible jpanel and i d like that jpanel to process them as if they came from the edt

6637771
mouse	keyboard
the only piece of the puzzle left is to somehow use the mouse and keyboard listeners on the glcanvas to receive and forward events to the jpanel

6637771
keyevent	actionevent	mouseevent	keyevent
i m assuming that the edt does some kind of conversion from mouseevent keyevent to actionevent to get the buttons and textfields to work properly

6637778
webclient	httpwebrequest	post	get
in other words you will need to study the facebook login form determine the action of the form and collect the same data in your application that the login form collects and send this data to the facebook site via http s get post to the login form action url via the webclient or httpwebrequest or any other valid http transport mechanism possibly even socket

also my code doesnt work in ggogle google-chrome but only firefox

6638148
width	height
about it not being out of the boundaries just have it get a random top and left within those boundaries taking into account the width and height of the div

6638160
post	get
it is simply telling the browser to repeat the page load which implies repeating the get or post request

6638190
put	get	post	get	post	put
if the server is returning a page as a response to put or delete eventhough it s not following the principles of those methods so it could just use a get or a post instead anyway

ive also tried urlconnection but also it inserts either get or post by default

so i thought may i need to put all files in my project folder but i still get errors

6638690

this might be messy but on the pop up component you could add an event listener after complete is fired if the height or width then you settimeout to a function after say 100ms until you get valid data

6638695
apache	nginx
personally i prefer nginx to apache but you can do this with both

6638695
apache	nginx
first the bad news - you cannot do this with a single installation of either apache or nginx - passenger is compiled against a single specific ruby interpreter that you are using

6638695
apache	nginx
you need to have two separate http server apache or nginx installations - one will be the default and answer on port 80 and the other will need to answer on another port this will not be publicly used

6638695
apache	nginx
you need to compile passenger for one ruby and http server apache or nginx and another passenger for the other ruby and http server both http servers can be apache both can be nginx or if you want to make things interesting you can have one of each

6638724
min	max
you ve already got all the functions you need for finding max min across domain and in sets of rows

6638975
pthreads	fork
i don t really know how resource sharing works on pthreads systems so i can t tell you whether to simply fork or use threads but there s the portable boost.thread library in addition to pthreads if you decide to go that way

6638988
getter	setter
setter and getter are used to replace directly accessing member variables from external classes

6638988
getter	setter
if you use a setter and getter in accessing a property you can include initialization error checking complex transformations etc

6639040
post	get
my problem is that i need to show the name of the blog and the link to it but they are in a higher level in the structure as below of where i get the post s title link content images etc

6639069
getter	setter	accessor	properties
you create getter and setter methods or a properties with synthesized accessor in the class with the integer give the other class a reference to some instance of the first class and have it use those accessor to get and set the integer

6639105
decoder	encoder
there doesn t seem to be an online decoder encoder although there was years ago

6639106
getter	setter
the above answers summarize the role of getter and setter better than i could however i did want to add that your code should ideally be structured to reduce the use of pure getter and setter those without complex constructions validation and so forth as they break encapsulation

6639106
getter	setter
this doesn t mean you can t ever use them stivlo s answer shows an example of a good use of getter and setter just try to minimize how often you use them

6639106
getter	setter
the problem is that getter and setter can act as a workaround for direct access of private data

6639106
getter	setter
moreover you introduce coupling for every getter or setter you write

6639140
post	get
within the http context there are other protocol methods other than get post but that s a limited option for many reasons as evidenced by its infrequent and specialized use such as submitting form data

6639140
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s easy to prove this using any web browser that has allows you to view the http request for the web page displayed in your browser safari s web inspector firefox google-chrome firebug etc.

6639256
unsigned	short

super	extends
you can specify your own port when exporting your remote object either via super port ... or exportobject remote port ... depending on whether you do or don t extends unicastremoteobject

if you extends activatable there are similarly super overloads with a port number

6639266
min	max
you can view all sqls with min max avg stats aggregated across all servers on you env or on individual servers

6639270

is defined only for built-in types like int float chars double etc

6639412
ostream	istream
it should be similar to overloading istream and ostream operators

as for looping by address arrays are already pointers so doing a simple for-loop is the same as looping over addresses

6639500

free	malloc
which free s memory allocated by the malloc inside the function1 function

6639578
free	malloc
will free the correct malloc ed chunk of memory

6639578
free	malloc
functions free malloc are defined at stdlib.h

6639582
post	put
if you need all that interfaces it s diffcult to say to me just by reading your post i would personaly suggest put them all in dataaccess and also conversion utilities too

6639585
free	malloc
you need to include stdlib.h to use free and malloc

6639585
free	malloc
it just happens to not matter what free and malloc actually do in your code above so it still works

6639602
width	height
the autosizing clamps to the edges and has flexible height and width so it should be

6639607
free	malloc
this is important because if you dont free memory you can reach in a situtation where your ram is full and calls to malloc fail

6639613
folder	directory
note if you use nuget it creates a folder packages along side your solution directory

6639664
background-image	background-position

6639680
width	height
you need to be sure to set the width and height of the image

6639682
free	malloc
the user-defined new delete-operators would have to call the c++-standard library s implementation of new delete-operators but i have left that out for briefity and relied on malloc and free instead

6639687
google-chrome	safari
note probably stating the obvious but the above will only work in webkit browsers google-chrome safari

6639739
int	chars
in particular given that an int has 32 bits of information and a chars has 16 bits of information requiring reversibility means you can only have strings of zero one or two chars and even that s assuming that you re happy to encode as 0 0 or something similar

6639772
hash	md5
as far as one-way goes - an md5 hash would be considerably more unique but by no means unique than the simple hashcode - but might be verging on unwieldy depending on your definition

6639774
rss	feed
i do not want my wp blog to print rss atom feed urls in html

6639845
super	extends
class a is a super class and b extends from it so it s more specific

width	height
the element doesn t have inline style which would be supplied by a style attribute not a height or width attribute

6640619
int	chars
that would mean that when using a named color the browser does not have to manually parse from a string containing hex chars to the corresponding int all it needs to do is an o 1 hash look-up

innodb	myisam
all features of the engine are then of course available so indeed the innodb table can have foreign key constraints but the same rules apply with innodb ndb as innodb myisam mysql won t complain if you mention a column located in an ndb myisam table in an innodb table definition but won t enforce the integrity either

6640833
width	height
the million dollar question is how to put the width height of the elements

6640833
width	height
any help on how to define the width height of the above elements to make this 9x2 grid fill the width and take up as much space as neccessary on the height would be greatly appreciated

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
and it works like a charm in almost all browsers firefox opera safari and even the designer-killer browser ie

6640841
post	get
also sending data using get opposed to post method is not really safe since the request url will be visible in the logs thinking of firewalls and so on

6640843
button	checkbox
however i have several different sets of checkbox and radio button throught the page

6640862
int	boolean
we can convert the boolean to int and perform this easy check

6640894
getter	setter
say if i have a class in java and i want it to be a javabean those getter and setter methods

6640894
getter	setter
it is very tedious to have to write all those getter and setter methods for all the properties in order to make myclass a javabean

6640908
getter	setter
for example in eclipse it s right-click source - getter and setter

6640911
getter	setter
eclipse netbeans and perhaps other ide s have a generate getter and setter -shortcut

6640930
getter	setter
the selected getter setter indicates if the checkbox is to be displayed as checked or not

6640999
folder	directory
move it to the same directory folder as the default resources file

6641012
subtraction	addition
for some operations addition and subtraction the same instruction is used for both signed and unsigned types

6641012
division	multiplication
there are also separate instructions for signed unsigned multiplication and division mul imul and div idiv where imul and idiv are used for signed values

6641016
unsigned	short
the rules about promotion to at least int or unsigned int in arithmetic expressions are pretty much designed to avoid this happening when you multiply say an unsigned short by 2 the result is an int or unsigned int if short and int are the same size

6641016
unsigned	short
the only time a mask might be required is if when you convert the result back to unsigned short

6641016
unsigned	short
even then i think that with care an implementation can sometimes leave additional irrelevant bits in the top of an int -sized register used to hold an intermediate unsigned short value

6641016
addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	multiplication	modulo	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	modulo
you know that those extra top bits don t affect the modulo results of addition multiplication or subtraction and that they would be masked off if the value is stored to memory assuming an instruction that stores the bottom 2 bytes of an int -sized register to 2 bytes of memory the modulo basically is free

6641024
button	checkbox
a retrieve the current form data the value selected in a radio button group the values selected in a checkbox group and the value in a textfield in the second jsp and update the database

and i want to pop-up a dialog layer where there are also a few buttons

6641054
listview	gridview
on android 3.1 you can create app widgets that the user can resize though this is mostly for app widgets using gridview or listview

6641116
integer	unsigned
c++ defines signed integer overflows as undefined behavior and unsigned integers as modulo2

6641116
division	multiplication
for unsigned arithmetic this is not the case and the compiler has to emit code that does the multiplication and division

6641155
width	height
i m trying to create a vertical button in php but i have problem with the positioning when i created a 200px height and 40px width png i want to put the text to the center of that image

6641251
hash	md5
for an almost unique hash you will need something of cryptographic size md5 128 bits sha-1 160 bits or sha-2 256 or 512 bits

6641251
hash	md5
an md5 hash looks like d131dd02c5e6eec4693d9a0698aff95c in hex

try-catch	exception-handling
if you want the exception-handling to bubble up to button13_click then remove the try-catch from somevoid

6641320
getter	setter
you are incurring the interceptor overhead every time you use a getter or setter from your entity beans

6641326
devise	cancan
if you want to use one user model and implement roles then i think a combination of devise and cancan would be a great choice

6641331
serializable	deserialization
i was already using flexjson for serializable and it seems flexjson is just as simple for deserialization

6641339
super	implements
for most of my projects i have been using devise and then use option 2 from their admin role wiki which is super easy to implements

6641359
error-handling	exception-handling
in general simply printing out an exception-handling and then pretending it didn t happen isn t a suitable error-handling strategy.

6641388
post	get
also if i try to reference post variables i get

6641396
png	ico
for better or worse the icon also has to be an ico file - a png won t work

6641410
stateless	stateful
next you would need some form of authentication either stateless send the credentials each time - but this will require the back-end to check them each time or stateful by establishing a session token

6641411
for-loop	arrays
another option that might work is to create a for-loop and populate the arrays

6641473
put	get
you can iterate over childnodes to get the nodetype if nodetype is text you can put your condition

6641493
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	inherited	properties
because the uitabbarcontroller class inherited from the uiviewcontroller class tab bar controllers have their own view that is accessible through the view properties

according to this page on numeric types tinyint 1 and bit were synonymous before version 5.0.3 for myisam and 5.0.5 for memory innodb bdb and ndbcluster

6642035
implements	extends
i imagine you d do this when extends or implements a class or interface where the implementation is very specific to the scope that you re in

6642054
int	chars
the standard c integral types are all the flavours of int and chars and also pointers because pointers are just numbers namely memory addresses

6642080

6642108
moose	mason
the best for me would be an extension rewrite of mason for compiling into joose javascript instead of moose perl

6642108
moose	mason
like in mason - the source is compiled into perl moose object and executed with perl .

6642111
profiling	debugging
if this passes i would be confident that it s a problem with the database and i would move on to profiling reviewing the logic of my stored procedure including debugging the procedure with the value being sent to the proc from the code

6642190
versioning	upgrade
if you did an upgrade they would remain at the older versioning 80 if it was upgrade from sql 2000

the big problem is that it does not work in google-chrome in firefox 4 ie9 it works great

6642269
margin	height
i m using .container as my wrapper which has a negative margin that is equal to the height of .footer

6642313
mouse	keyboard
however you can choose to disable it in either the x or y plane or both - this would prevent scrolling using both the mouse and keyboard

6642320
google-chrome	firefox
i need to detect via as3 inside flex mxml appication which is browser i am in - firefox google-chrome ie etc only name and version

mef	prism
actually i am going to develop a wpf application using prism with mef and mvvm

6642393
postgresql	mysql
you didn t really specify what the login credentials were used for but i d recommend you take a look at implementing a sql database mysql postgresql etc for this

6642422
setcontentview	findviewbyid
i don t see it in your code - you should call setcontentview before you can call findviewbyid otherwise it will return null

6642435
onclick	onmousedown
note you should just use the function in onclick it s not a link so it will only excute the javacript bit so no onmousedown just

6642437
distance	polygons
when a user comes and places a marker i m creating a polygons with some radius as the buffer distance

6642448
hash	salt
another thing you should probably do is not storing the passwords in encrypted form but just storing a salt hash of them sha-1 or something adequate in your database

6642492
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
i can use an edittextprefence in the preferenceactivity but that s really not preferred it will work if it has to and i could just use a dialogpreference with checkboxes in it but i really like the summary capability of a checkboxpreference so i would rather have a dialogpreference that opens and then shows a preferencescreen of checkboxpreferences

6642552
keydown	keyup
thus keydown or keyup would tell you that they pressed the backspace key but keypress is what you get after the result of the backspace key

6642592
post	get
it s not very clear but you can t send an image with javascript through post get http request

6642604
post	get
you will get many post on stackoverflow for orientation

6642646
set	bag
in case it wasn t already clear i need to map my list as a nhibernate list not a set or a bag so that the index of the items is persisted

6642663
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for example ie9 has the worst html5 score according to of any modern web browser ie firefox google-chrome safari etc.

6642666
hide	show
then when you detect the event that show the keyboard hide the current view and show the alternate one

6642705
postgresql	mysql
i have a java application under tomcat connecting to a postgresql and a mysql databases

6642705
postgresql	mysql
i suppose the problem is that the postgresql mysql database was idle for too long but when i access the database with java i open a connection and always close it when finished so i do not understand why the connection should remain open for so long

6642732
ocp	principles
hence violates ocp open closed principles a static method is not extensible

6642735
put	get
now circumflex supports matchers which can be put right within the get specification

6642754
folder	directory
your css and jsp folder should be out of web-inf directory as this directory will be locked when you want direct access to your jsp files which i think you want and you don t need to map jsp files

6642794
typedef	typename
typedef typename t type type type

6642794
typedef	typename
becuase typedef can be applied only to a typename

6642799
width	height
that site isn t doing anything special simply setting the height and width of the application and slapping it on the page - no resize is happening

6642860
width	height
increase the width height of your element and you should see larger infowindows automatically

6642860
width	height
i solved it by creating a cloned div containing the infowindow content measuring that div s width and height and then setting the infowindow content div to have that measured width and height

6642875
width	height
you could let the image stretch to the size of the monitor if you use an image tag to display the image and specify its width and height properties to be 100 but that will result in a stretched image depending of the device used.

6642901
post	get
same goes if i use post instead of get

6642901
post	get
also should i just leave it as is in the event that it is indeed a good fail proof mechanism that correctly catches all get and post variables or should i disable it if that s even possible

6642959
implements	extends
all it takes is to define an object with the desired name extends from atomicmatcher as this one implements add etc and implements the name and apply methods

6643047
post	get
it looks like you need to do the request_token call as a get request not a post

6643052
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux	centos	linux
i am having trouble installing cherrypy 3.2 on linux machines both on ubuntu and centos

6643057

tcpclient	networkstream
if someone connects it passes the tcpclient to a loop that listens to that tcpclient specifically and handles all interaction with that user through networkstream

6643067
xml-rpc	json-rpc
look into xml-rpc or json-rpc which is likely supported in some why by all language through modules or packages

6643079
post	get
when i inherit from such a class ...let s call it baseclass the post no longer works and i get a 500 response from the server...i m just not clear what the reason is

6643082
put	get
if you put n it will get the value from the nth block you specify

6643085
put	get
which is clearly different conceptually even if practically you use it the same way put in nothing and sooner or later get out a t

6643089
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
we are in the midst of implementing a labeling functionality exactly like gmail for our webapp - you can select the posts checkbox and select which labels to apply delete from a dropdownlistfor of labels which themselves are a set of checkbox

6643089
post	get
output given a set of selected post and the set of selected labels get a array of items for the json with the following values

6643089
post	get
get current number of selected post var selectioncount 5 say 5 post selected

6643089
hide	show
but after an acknowledgment is received i still need to update the front end in a similar fashion so i was back to square one so to speak since i d have to repeat the same thing on the front end to decide which labels to hide and which to show

6643105
tcplistener	tcpclient
you should have two separate threads one for tcplistener and other for the tcpclient that are running on there own

6643126
children	parent
i am using parallel forkmanager to pass a few variables from the children to the parent

6643136

let s say i have an abstract-class vehicle and this class has one subclass named aircraft

6643157
min	max
i ve created a custom data source for autopoco below that returns a random datetime between a min and max date

6643215
post	get
i think you can try do it by using hidden fields in forms but you have to create hidden form and make all links act as submit button with some short javascript code setting proper value in fields responsible for target but imho it is not the best solution because all the requests will be using post method and get all disadvantages of it

6643218
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome devtools aka safari web inspector has two parts

6643223
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
on linux mint ubuntu 11.04 with a samsung galaxy s2 i didn t use any rules but when reset adb or when devices view it shows

vim	emacs
if there is some comprehensive guide to using textwrangler with python or if you want to pimp any other editor for os x besides the tired old emacs vim let me know.

6643254

it makes sense to hangs the children off the parent viewmodel

6643263
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried google-chrome firefox ie

6643275
folder	directory
but iis returns 403 error and thinks that i m gonna get the directory list of the content folder

in jquery how can i append a read more link after about 162 char s hide the rest and once the read more link is clicked show it clicked it.

6643582
spaces	delimiter
also the delimiter are matched character-by-character so there is no use repeating the spaces six times nor will your call to strtok match a run of six spaces

6643603
width	height
you might want to set the grid s width and height instead of the mediaelement that of the size of the video

6643647
put	get
when i run it in either visual studio 2008 or visual studio 2008 and hit a breakpoint i put inside the print method i get the following in the callstack window

subclass	abstract-class
the filetransfer class is an abstract-class specifying what is required to perform a file transfer it can t actually perform one itself without a subclass implementing various methods

6643710
int	double
the first value is a month name which can be stored as an int the second is a double or float the third seems dx with x varying from 1 to 4 again this could be an int

6643736
retaincount	dealloc
retaincount is 2 prior to my final call to release in dealloc

6643790
folder	directory
go to your user directory c profiles youruser there should be a folder called .m2 may be hidden

6643793
innodb	myisam
there is no way to do it in innodb and myisam engines in mysql

6643818
config	ini
if you have a ini file for application config values you can put it there too

6643880
int	double
double is stored as a binary fractions and its precision varies with the value and int has limited range of 4 bytes

6643902
children	parent
owned one-to-many relationships seem to be what i am looking for -- but i am having trouble to see how it can help me to get back the parent object with the populated collection of children entities

6643921
touchescancelled	touchesended
if we get the same touches in touchesended on the view we redirect to touchescancelled

6643946
hlsl	glsl
both d3d and ogl take the form of api functions you can call to pass instructions to the gpu as well as shader programs written in dedicated c-like languages hlsl for d3d and glsl for opengl

6643955
int	double
it basically stores the number as a string and so avoiding the int double limits

6643957
post	get
there are times when it is not possible to use all of the http verbs this causes many rest apis to allow other actions via either post or get

6643969
spaces	delimiter
you have to examine each character in the buffer since each character could be a spaces and any character in the delimiter could be wrong

6643969
memcmp	strcmp	strncmp	strcmp	strncmp	memcmp
changing a strncmp or strcmp to memcmp is also probably going to be negligible

free	malloc
i want to estimate as accurately as is reasonably possible how much memory has been new or malloc since startup minus the memory that has been free or delete

6643985
free	malloc
it is enough for my purposes to know the actual number and size of allocated held blocks by any malloc implementation i don t need the detail of actual malloc memory minus the the free memory

i need to concatenate 2 or more audio files into one and export result as aiff mp3 caf or m4a format

6644062
typedef	typename
right now it s quite possible to need the typename keyword multiple times in a typedef type-specifier so a lot more analysis would be needed to convince me that typename is never necessary in a typedef

6644062
typedef	typename
in typedef typename t type type type t type type requires use of the typename keyword because its nested-name-specifier t type is a dependent name and the standard says same section

6644075
hash	salt
don t persist the user s password take a hash and be sure to salt it

6644078
free	malloc
i m not totally sure what you are asking malloc minus free is less than the actual usage because of the memory fragmentation if you really need that number you have to use custom allocators which are tiny wrappers around existing ones everywhere in your code which is going to be painful

6644085
cells	tablecell
i ve a tablecell that creates other cells on push

6644142
rss	feed
this is the header of all the rss feed i use

6644158
treemap	linkedhashmap
either use a linkedhashmap whose iteration order is the same as insertion order at least it s defined or use a treemap whose iteration order is the natural sorting order

6644220
post	get
but i couldn t get it working then i tried pbd-ajax-load-posts and it loads the post but i can t get the post to load on their own containers they simply load below each other

6644267
try-catch	exception-handling
the calling function must handle the exception-handling in a try-catch block

6644267
try-catch	exception-handling
the calling function must throw the exception-handling to its caller function and thus you must choose some point where you actually use a try-catch block to handle the exception-handling

post	get
if you must use get then so be it but post would be the way to go with authentication

6644510
implements	extends
i m not entirely sure if this is what you re asking for but it sounds like you could use some kind of interface abstract class for the key and implements extends it appropriately for each key type

i tested this in internet explorer and google-chrome also and they both do the same as firefox

6649550
public	protected
by using one of the keywords public protected or private followed

6677722
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
iqueryable ilist ienumerable

6677722
ienumerable	iqueryable
i m primarily concerned with the ienumerable vs iqueryable question and more specifically the coupling between the dal and it s consumers

6677722
ienumerable	iqueryable
i can then return iqueryable from the function because it inherits ienumerable and i get to keep the deferred loading

6677722
ienumerable	iqueryable
as i understand it if your function returns ienumerable but you return iqueryable the iqueryable is reliant on an underlying datacontext

6677777
width	margin
your js would be mostly the same except that you will need to -5 from the calculated total width because we will be removing the 5px margin from the last image

6677840
cassini	iis
try iis express as an alternative for cassini that s why ms released it

6677860

6678149
public	protected	accessor	properties
accessor are treated as properties so as any properties it cannot be both protected and public

6678149
getter	setter	public	protected
in your case solution perhaps is to make the variable accessors designed to handle protected or internal while getter - public and no setter

6678149
getter	setter
getter is publilc and setter is internal

6678149
getter	setter
there is one thing to keep remember is that you cannot specify access modifier for both getter and setter at same time

6678376
google-chrome	firefox
the login works in firefox google-chrome

6678413
getter	setter
you could link the javadoc comment of getter and setter to the private field by adding a javadoc link

6678413
getter	setter
as the previous commentators stated i would just document the getter and setter properly

6678413
getter	setter
javadoc documents your public api which the getter and setter may belong to

6678416
portrait	landscape
activity will destroy recreated it self if the orientation changes from portrait to landscape and vice versa for that reason when you go back from land to port it may be some of the variable which you used in port activities may not be set possibly throws nullpointerexception.it is better if you provide more details like logcat and code

6678438
floating-point	integer
for this reason one should generally use movdqa when the data is being used with integer sse instructions and movaps when the data is being used with floating-point instructions

6678458
instances	transient
java.lang.illegalstateexception org.hibernate.transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing domain.user

6678869
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome safari triggers the domcontentloaded event before font-face is applied thus causing the problem

6678869
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
the solution is to not listen for domcontentloaded but instead go oldschool and listen to onreadystatechange and wait until the which is always triggered after font-face is applied as far as i can tell by my tests - which is of course what always happens in ie since it doesn t support domcontentloaded

6678873
disk	ram
if the files you read are copies then you can read them from a ram disk -- so you may have a background process that copies the files into a ram disk and then your program can read them from there

the only way to get an ssd on raid0 with trim support is with the new ocz revo 3 1.5gb read 1.25gb write a more affordable and stable solution to raided ssd with no trim is to buy an ssd on sata 3 550mb s

6678990
uitableview	reloaddata
uitableview objects are actually asking their data sources for the values to display as well as the number of sections etc...sending reloaddata to the table view will make it re-asking these values

6679004
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
have tested this in firefox 4 ie 9 opera 11 safari 5 win and google-chrome 12 and the layout seems to be robust across all browsers

6679015
int	double
i can use approach to convert either an int or double into string

6679032
inherited	properties
alternatively check your code behind file name and inherited properties on the page directive and make sure they both match

6679073
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
gzipinputstream inputstream new gzipinputstream new fileinputstream new file

6679094
folder	directory
i have a folder in the root directory called admin where the css js and images are

6679095
codeigniter	cakephp
this includes pretty much all frameworks like zend symfony 1 and 2 cakephp codeigniter an many others

6679101
expandablelistview	expandablelistadapter
take a look at expandablelistview and expandablelistadapter

6679108
spaces	delimiter
it uses 2 passive groups to evaluate the input string with the last expression being the one that splits the string with a spaces delimiter

6679151
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu or other linux packages might have a separate package for that

6679187
innodb	myisam
after testing it seems that myisam is faster than innodb when using when there is no where clause

6679210
hash	md5
redir.php writes relevant info into a db row along with some sort of identifier say an md5 hash of the user id + _ + current time plus a consumed flag set false

6679217
sorting	filtering
i have a search on my page where you have a filtering menu a option for sorting and a pagebrowser

6679259
maven	m2e
the project has the standard maven layout but is currently not configured as a maven project for m2e

6679264
blogspot	blogger
another example is blogger blogspot it is well known they use mod_rewrite for their sub-domains

6679293
implements	extends
i m extends a base collection class which implements a method isstale

6679305
nsurl	nsfilemanager
i tried nsurl path but it doesn t convert it into a directory path that the nsfilemanager can understand.

6679326
hide	show
on click i want to hide show some html code which is obtained via a get request to another page

6679368
hide	show
for your second idea if you really wanted to go that way you could create an object which show a pause button on top of your layout panel and hide show it when you want to indicate it is paused i suppose although it may look a little clumsy

6679378
pop-up	dialog
what you are saying a pop-up widow in android it is known as dialog which stays on the screen until user interacts with it

6679386
width	height
you could calculate these fixed values at runtime by trying to figure out what the height of some text will be in a given cell at a given width using a given font

6679408
outputstream	inputstream
use the inputstream outputstream interfaces supplied by the http objects instead of putting readers and writers on them

6679442
mouse	keyboard
if you need something different play a little with keyboard and mouse events

6679465
administration	activation
the application-specific permission settings do not grant local activation permission for the com server application with clsid class id of com object here and appid app id of the com+ application here to the user machinename administration sid sid here from address localhost using lrpc

6679497
joptionpane	jdialog
you can use either jdialog or joptionpane

6679500
sorting	filtering
you should use the cust variable instead to apply the sorting on the filtering set

6679502
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on google-chrome and firefox but not ie8

6679502
google-chrome	firefox
however if i take the height attribute completely out it doesn t appear as i would like in firefox or google-chrome

6679549
ant	maven
one option to avoid what i mentioned above is to have some ant or maven task to assemble classes from different jars into a new jar which contains the final persistence xml

6679592
awt	swing
is it comparable to swing awt

6679604
dictionary	map
the dictionary keys lead you to a value that is a map of the objects property names and their values

6679619
tunnel	vpn
personally i tunnel all my traffic over a vpn so i know it is slighty safer when in public places

6679711
client-side	server-side
you can t handle browser events which is client-side via php server-side

6679739
disk	ram
this will take time as in the case of a 10gb file with less ram it may have to allocate the space on disk

6679771
hide	show
this hide directories from the search view and show only the files which matched the pattern

6679783
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested ie firefox opera google-chrome and solved a lot of thing related to css and jquery compatibility.

6679809
collabnet	svn
the svn servers are visualsvn 2.1.9 for http urls and the collabnet 1.6.17 for svn urls

6679809
collabnet	svn
the problem also does not happen when acessing the local repositories via file urls or when accessing the repositories via native svn command line tools from collabnet

6679819
integer	unsigned
a 32-bit unsigned integer

6679837
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
it s also possible to create upper tabs using a styled uisegmentedcontrol or just uibutton s that switches views

6679892
jwindow	jdialog
2 create only one jframe and other top-level containers would be jdialog jwindow

6679916
post	get
next oldpage when i login with a correct user i receive an error message which told me that no next variable is passed user password is set as get neither as post but the login works fine as expected

6679931
post	get
zend_form does not automatically populate validate itself agaist get post variables

6679940
children	parent
for parent pointer you have to ensure it always points to the actual parent in the setters for the children in parent so adding an unset to the treenode destructor is comparably simple

6679942
post	get
etc by using gdata and oauth2.0 server side check this link i finished the first step and got the first code and when try to post a request to get the oauth2_token i always got the error the remote server returned an error 400 bad request.

6679951
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it in firefox and google-chrome and it works

6679954
jar	war
you can separate java classes into several jar submodules but if you split the war project into several smaller wars using some kind of overlapped packaging things get complicated

6679954
jar	war
and converted the whole project to facelets 2.0 to avoid the dependency of jdk tools.jar and custom resource handler the only reason is to change the war submodules to jar submodules and move all webapp pages into class resources

6679954
jar	war
so the conclusion maven does great job for jar dependencies but no war or single war

6680030
inherited	properties
this places the properties of the global object at the start of the scope chain from which all other environments inherited

6680037
post	put
according to restful web services pattern the difference should be in that put is used to update a resource on server while post is used to create a resource on server

6680037
put	get	post	get	post	put
this could be important because browsers do not support puts only get and post natively so web-apps usually simulate puts by putting a hidden form field smth like _method put in web-forms

6680037
post	put
so when user clicks submit then browser does a post which includes _method put param so the server can recognize it is a put

6680037
post	put
if this is your case then just try appending your post params with a required by your web-app param smth like _method put

6680053
centos	linux
on my live centos linux server i get a 2 digit precision 1310564569.41 for example

6680056
int	double
usual configurations are 8 16-bit int 4 32-ints 4 floats 2 double

6680133
bazaar	git
some reading of the git fast-import documentation and reviewing of the bazaar fast-import documentation examples suggests that the same mark s files should be used when importing multiple related but unmerged branches from the same repository

6680137
width	height
then get the screen size say width and height then and

6680138
realloc	malloc
i have a suspicion that i am not understanding how the pointer is interacting with malloc realloc

6680202
post	get
when i post an article i get the following error

6680215
listview	gridview
i m using a listview that contains a gridview there s a gridviewcolumn which only contains buttons

6680238
int	chars
essentially you re interpreting an array of chars as a pointer to int

6680238
int	chars
suppose sizeof int is 4 and the chars array contains these bytes

6680244
opera	google-chrome	debian	linux
in debian linux when using a browser such as opera or google-chrome the page loads with a js error

6680266
int	chars
that s not necessarily a good typecast there s a good chance that int and chars are a completely different size and this could lead to some undefined behaviour

6680319
google-chrome	firefox
confirmed working in google-chrome firefox and ie 8.

6680349
mouseover	mouseleave
you would want to use the live mouseover mouseleave events

6680354
mouseleave	mouseenter
also it may be interesting to see mouseenter link and mouseleave link

6680375
radiobuttonlist	rowdatabound	radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist	rowdatabound	checkboxlist	gridview	rowdatabound	gridview	checkboxlist	gridview	radiobuttonlist
for the survey i read values from db and dynamically generate asp.net controls like radiobuttonlist checkboxlist textbox on the form during gridview s rowdatabound event

6680375
gridview	radiobuttonlist
i am able to cast radiobuttonlist from gridview but values are inaccessible even though they still persist after postback

6680379
int	chars
in this case you are packing chars into int

6680379
int	chars
depending on the system you may arrive at an int with the internal bit representation which matches char0 char1 char2 char3 followed by another int with the internal bit representation that matches chars four through seven

6680379
int	chars
odds are good that if you dig through the code enough you ll find that there is another place where the pointer to your constructed int gets cast back into a chars

6680403
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
jsfiddle tested in google-chrome safari and firefox

6680437
xsl-fo	xslt
i m writing an xslt transformation for xsl-fo and need to repeat something for each letter in a string value for example

6680464
int	chars
since it is an unsigned chars it would need to be type cast as int well it does not need to be but it is good practice

6680464
int	chars
as per someone concern over size a size int will for the most part always be smaller than an unsigned chars

6680478
gson	jackson
if this does not work then you could use other serialization mechanism like jackson or gson

6680545
junit	testng
i have a small experience with junit and testng and today i need to do some unit testing for java database code

6680566
centos	linux
i have a spring+hibernate+mysql+jstl architecture running in a linux centos production enviroment

6680571
post	get
this will call the search.php which will get the search string as a post variable like here you process the search string and echo the results which will be get back to the page as data

6680571
post	get
if you want to use get then just replace post in the jquery funstion as get and you can use in the search.php

6680593
post	put
then i saw your post and noticed that you put it in the activity

6680635
post	get
post to get a plot image1 with this code

6680637
google-chrome	firefox
i started programming this layout in firefox and everything looked perfect then went to check out google-chrome and make sure it was ok and low and behold google-chrome screwed it up

6680665
richfaces	icefaces	primefaces	icefaces	primefaces	richfaces
the closest what you can get is ajax poll push provided by 3rd party component libraries like richfaces primefaces or icefaces

6680722
javassist	cglib
i ve never tried anything quite like that myself but you should have a look at asm cglib and javassist

6680746
versioning	upgrade
i suspect this later versioning upgrade the serialize function to recognise the new html5 input types

6680777
javassist	cglib
i believe you need some byte code altering tool framework such as asm cglib or javassist

6680803
nvl	sysdate
nvl lastupdate sysdate

6680868
serializable	deserialization
wcf doesn t support that kind of deserialization unless you configure it for .net serializable by using the netdatacontractserializer instead of the standard datacontractserializer

6680893
min	max
but you can easily get the same result with a complexity of o n by enumerating the collection and keeping track of the min or max value

6680954
post	get
also if there were a significant amount of cpu bound post processing that needs to be done with the data then you could get that going concurrently while another batch of data is being read

6680975
pop-up	dialog
i worked well but had one crucial flaw when i would want to actually use the stt engine a dialog would pop-up telling it when to stop recording

6681044
postgresql	mysql
i can t speak about mysql but in postgresql you could use crosstab function from tablefunc module

6681064
button	checkbox
your form_selection routine should draw a form which has a select checkbox radio button or whatever that will post a string or integer for the switch back to the script you are running from

6681169
children	parent
all of the examples have the primary keys of the parent and children tables with the same name

6681176
post	get
the routes will be constrained to post events only which means you can still add some routing for your get methods on the same route

6681181
google-chrome	firefox
i am using dropdownlist control .net 3.5 in my page and it works fine in ie firefox but does not work in google-chrome

6681197
google-chrome	firefox
now for some reason in firefox when i tick the box and click on submit i get the error message tick the alert statement but its fine in google-chrome

6681199
erd	diagram
by database flow diagram i think you mean an entity relationship diagram erd

6681236
getter	setter
the property combined with synthesize setup the getter and setter methods for your objects

6681276
children	parent
as jonas alludes to the handlevisibility property of an object will determine if the object shows up in its parent s list of children and thus if it will be returned by functions like findobj

6681276
children	parent
additionally if the handlevisibility property of the parent figure of an object is set to off then none of its children including said object can become the current object

6681314
qapplication	qwidget
judging this page you can set stylesheets into use with qapplication setstylesheet and qwidget setstylesheet

6681416
addition	multiplication
addition and a little comparison of the difference in speed between the built in function tile and the multiplication

6681420
hide	show
to your first question regarding dynamically hiding and showing the employeeid you would want to use the visibility property on the employeeid column row or textbox and set visibility to hide and check display can be toggled by this report item this will allow you to interactive show hide the data

6681485
google-chrome	safari
the header works just fine on the secondary pages for all browsers but the home page is badly broken on google-chrome safari and ie7

6681485
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the image is shifted down out of the header div covers other content and is very badly distorted

6681487
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
caliburn.micro has its own mechanism for view viewmodel communication as an alternative to commanding called actions

6681488
centos	linux
i created the script on a virtual machine running on windows with a centos os the enter in windows is r n while in linux is n

6681498
gesturedetector	motionevent
it uses its own instance of gesturedetector and feeds it with motionevent from onintercepttouchevent

6681498
gesturedetector	motionevent
gallery s own gesturedetector mgesturedetector in gallery.java doesn t get all motionevent and thus sometimes reports huge sudden scrolls that cause gallery to jump around

6681512
google-chrome	firefox
when i try to use the dom methods to set style properties it doesn t work in firefox ie 7 but it does in ie 8 google-chrome

6681528
folder	directory
after that i try to deploy a war file ps.war which i copy into the webapps folder inside the tomcat installation directory

6681536
rspec	capybara
also how would i test for this using rspec capybara because apparently my tests don t cover this

6681583
submit	submission
i have multiple forms on the same page but i want to submit all forms together once instead of submission one at a time

6681655
mvp	presenter
i have to say web application is built using web forms mvp pattern so pages not controls have a presenter that manages all the logic and send data to bind web forms that load the needed controls

6681678
hex	binary
so i wanna convert this above mentioned hex datagram into the binary format like x01 x00 x12 x59

6681699
centos	linux
my linux distro is centos release 5.6

6681720
hide	show
can you put the display of the component in an html div container and then hide show that container

6681723
width	height
try setting 100 for width height

6681723
width	height
if that doesn t work you can modify the template directly under html-template directory which is the way i prefer to do it and leave the width height out of the application tag

6681737
multiplying	add
there is no need to use a as some kind of intermediate and using move is imo rather low level and therefore a little tricky it is easy to forget to multiplying by the size of a character it is unchecked it does not add a #0 etc. especially if you don t know what exactly you are doing

6681773
width	height
its because nivo slider here has a specific width and height

6681786
factors	matrix
the model matrix required has the same number of rows as your data but the number of columns in it is roughly the number of unique strings factors levels

6681807
opera	google-chrome
you may be thinking that this is an obvious thing but it caught me when using mozilla google-chrome opera instead of ie

6681820
super	extends
one of my java class child extends an super class parent that is part of an libary so i am not able to modify it

6681866
put	get
i can get the column name from column.columnname and the value from rows 0 .item 0 but for the life of me i can t put it all together in a simple loop

6681876
lcds	graniteds
you ll need to use a server that has push technology like blazeds graniteds lcds wowza server fms etc

6681954
range	minimum
i want to specify a range for a slice then execute several versions of minimum maximum algorithm to verify correctness and execution time

6681968
aether	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
i checked out the source to maven 3.0.3 and edited the pom.xml to change the version of aether from 1.11 to 1.12

6681977
maven	m2e
i also see the repo listed along with maven central in my m2e global maven repositories

6681977
maven	m2e
my problem is that while maven central is browsable and updatable in m2e my internal one is not and when it tries to update i get this

6682028
jar	war
i d like to use dependencies from a remote eclipse p2 repository in a regular maven 3 build jar or war packaging - all without converting the p2 repo to a local maven repo which is what osgi-to-maven2 and m4e seem to do

6682079
pull	push
you can use pull queues to lease tasks from gae process them and then add them to push queues that will store the data in gae

6682101
centos	linux
for in case of centos redhat linux

6682110
maven	pom.xml
in the new maven projects declare each dependency in the pom.xml and make sure the build system runs maven builds after the legacy builds

6682157
pop-up	dialog
the library is built on top of easyxdm for cross domain messaging and facilitates interaction via modal dialog or via pop-up

6682164
getter	setter
a bunch of similar getter and setter responsible for managing the relationships within the user instance

6682164
getter	setter
i could technically also wrap the dao within the entity and put the helper getter and setter back into the entity class where they should be but i am not sure whether if that is a good practice as well

6682178
zclip	zeroclipboard
i m using jquery plugin zclip or zeroclipboard which copies content to the clipboard via a button or link

6682198
put	get
i know this is not the proper eav mvc 1000 lines of xml magento module way of doing it however since this is a straightforward http https problem you can put a couple of lines in .htaccess to get your search box behaving correctly

6682248
inherited	properties
it seem to inherited the properties from its invisible parent

6682252
public	protected
mark imported method as private and wrap with a public or protected or internal method that uses the .net parameters that uses system.runtime.interopservices.marshal.copy and calls external deallocate

6682272
lxml	libxml2
lxml based on libxml2

6682287
youtube	vimeo
i have a list of vimeo videos which i play through an api and i also have a list of youtube videos which i play via an api

6682287
youtube	vimeo
what i m trying to do is create a universal player which will combine vimeo and youtube videos into a single loop

6682287
youtube	vimeo
say when all vimeo videos have finished continue and play the youtube videos

6682313
profiling	debugging
i was using nszombie just fine to debugging my project but now it fails to show anything at all when i run the profiling

6682313
profiling	instrumentation
but when i choose the allocations profiling instrumentation in xcode 4 it offers no report on my nszombie behavior

6682393
updatepanel	scriptmanager
in html move the updatepanel direct after the scriptmanager line

6682395
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
you d have to repeat the rule to support that browser along with google-chrome safari and opera see this answer for info

6682452
put	get
and i get the following result in console which shows me that the method doesn t set the default value i ve put

6682454
post	get
now i have to figure out how to get the user s blog name since you can t seem to post to the default blog anymore

6682460
serializable	deserialization
this can be custom faster more compact serializable deserialization a faster larger buffer resizable version of bytebuffer or adding an atomic variable one not supported currently

6682475
width	height
i m stumped i ve already deduced it to being within this merge section of the larger layout edit thanks yes line #10 was sort of obvious the textview on line 10 clearly needed the width and height but there were no crashes using just textview that exists further in the code which i had pasted into line #10

6682476
google-chrome	firefox
all these works fine for ie9 google-chrome and firefox

6682478
submit	submission
with js you can prevent the form submission then check for validation and submit after you have validate it correctly

6682496
innodb	myisam
i m trying to set up a regular backup of a rather large production database half a gig that has both innodb and myisam tables

6682505
mouseup	mousedown
even with a bare-tform without a resizeable border adding my own resizeable border and handling the mousedown and mouse move and mouseup messages directly proved too problematic

6682544
hide	show
in ideal situations i show everything on a page then hide what needs to be hidden

6682560
put	get
as a matter of fact when i put a breakpoint in the vb code-behind like the 3rd or 4th line of code in the function i get both alert boxes before i can step into my code behind

6682563
width	margin
as noah says adding the correct margin left right to the .tr depending corner width

6682593
width	height
and it s pretty clear by looking at llrect.createbox that the third parameter to getboudningarea is going to be treated as the full width height of a bounding box

6682600
width	height
then you can show it and get width and height i don t think this is particularly hacky to do if you do it this way

6682601
width	height
usually if you set a default height-width in a css file you should be able to get the width height of an hidden element

6682640
client-side	server-side
you can then call on the model the startupdate and let it run as needed pausing it when it would be inconvenient for a server-side update to run say in the middle of a customer manipulation of the data and restarting it after a client-side change had successfully completed a write to the server

6682647
post	get
in my post form i call and get a nice ordered list of check boxes

6682650
inherited	subclassing
because of subclassing and multiple inherited additional data may be placed in the class before the regular struct members

6682651
hide	show
and just hide show elements

6682656
int	boolean
in your code you have an int strings.len source as the conditional check which is expecting a boolean response so it s failing

6682703
setinterval	settimeout
i have read many examples on settimeout and setinterval but what i continuously see is those only work with a for next style loop where the loop goes for a predetermined amount of cycles dependent upon a variable

6682707
int	boolean
the comparison expects a bool you re providing an int with strings.len source which returns some number not a boolean value like true or false

6682719
getter	setter
your o is not a property at the moment you need to define setter and getter

6682720
post	put
the fact that you put a localhost url in your post obviously shows that you have quite a bit to learn about web development in general

6682723
hide	show
yes it is possible to show hide elements in any view

6682731
int	double
i am following a tutorial i found online by ibm but i can t seem to find a way to use an int as a key and a double as the value being stored

6682764
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
you should select one that either uses a settimeout call explicitly in the loop or that cleans up their setinterval timer with clearinterval

6682787
openfire	ejabberd
it s a cocoa implementation of xmpp and should work nicely with ejabberd though i use openfire

6682868
tinyint	boolean
until mysql implements a bit datatype if you re processing is truly pressed for space and or time such as with high volume transactions create a tinyint field called bit_flags for all your boolean variables and mask and shift the boolean bit you desire in your sql query

6682919
hash	md5
i used the md5 hash of the original filename to make a unique name

6682937
unix	solaris
other solaris unix other

6682945
accessor	properties
in both aspects using properties getters as a database accessor violates the principle of least astonishment to client code

6682961
youtube	vimeo
instantiate the relevant player yt or vimeo using their javascript api youtube vimeo inside the container

6682969
rtsp	sdp
the only official way in rtsp to inform a receiver about the frame rate is inside the sdp of the describe response

6683493
oncreate	findviewbyid
since the onclicklistener constructor will run before the oncreate method getintent will return null and you will not have set your contentview so all your findviewbyid s will also return null

6684028
stdout	stderr	stdout	stdio
reassigning and should work fine unless something in your code your gems or ruby itself is using the constants stdout stderr or is accessing the streams directly through c s stdio unix s low level read write with numeric file descriptors or is opening their own access to the streams using io.new

i m under the impression that when i go to hard copy a bunch of data using the superclass the subclassing data is loss in translation so to speak

6684637
post	get
just not use the get cid but get it out of the post in your customer.php script

6684654
post	get
the reason this is required is that you are submitting the form to your server via post but appending parameters to the url requires submission via the get method

6684691
folder	directory
in all the examples the package directory is relative to the solution folder but i strongly suspect that you could just as easily use an absolute path such as c packages if you wanted

6684739

just make sure that it is clear to the user that the button post directly perhaps use a dialog to get them to confirm they want to post

6684873
hex	binary
as a programmer sometimes i like to work in hex or binary and also being able to easily move back and forth between hexadecimal binary and decimal

6684918
cufft	fftw
i am working on a code which needs to be time efficient and thus using cufft for this purpose but when i try to compute fft of a very large data in parallel it is slower than cpu fftw and the reason i find after finding the time for every line of code using high precision timing code is that cudamalloc taking around 0.983 sec while the time for rest of the lines of code is around 0.00xx sec which is expected ..

6684951
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the following javascript opens a window as required in ie8 ff4 and safari 5.0.5 but not in opera or google-chrome

6685144
spaces	delimiter
i m looking to drill down on a multivalued field that contains spaces delimiter list of words

6685167
post	get
there s just way too much code to post in here and i can t narrow it down to a specific line or even file since i don t get any error output and as i mentioned above debugging it is of no use because it runs fine in the location for which i have access to a debugger

6685168
versioning	upgrade
then i think that your project got somehow corrupted when doing an upgrade from one xcode versioning to another i am just guessing based on my experience

6685241

width	height
to half the figure width and a height equal to half the

6685398
mef	prism
ideablade s devforce product. if you go with silverlight you ll also want to learn about mef and or prism to understand modular application development

6685414
setinterval	clearinterval
another reason is that if you want to stop the loop you have to explicitly call clearinterval which means you have to remember the handle returned from the original setinterval call

6685426
udp	tcp
so what s happening now is that the write case prevents the read case since udp socket is always writable versus tcp that buffers outgoing data

6685433
public	protected
however it will only work on private or protected methods and mine need to be public in order to work with zend_json_server

i m trying to create an implementation of pbkdf2 to generate a key to encrypt a file with aes-256 but i have a question about salt size

6685656
width	height
you have specified the width and height for the box to be 390x180 so that s what it is

6685686
g++	gcc
if you are using gcc g++ the -m or -mm option will output a line with the information you seek

6685699

in caliburn.micro s case you would have 2 public properties on your main viewmodel each of type algorithmtesterviewmodel and on your main view 2 contentcontrol s called the same as your 2 public properties

6685702
jdom	xom
but don t use dom itself there are much better alternatives like jdom and xom that have much friendlier apis

6685704
post	get
i ve read this so post and this page but still don t understand how i get my driver to be installed

6685743
memcpy	malloc
afaik malloc is not slower than memcpy

6685778

6685812
free	malloc
if you start mixing low level memory allocation with malloc free and c++ objects you will run into a lot of troubles while making your code almost unreadable

6685828
int	double
even though the api allows you to pass in a double and hence a value like 20.5 dpi values are int

6685864
integer	unsigned
i would check that p_id is not flagged as unsigned integer

6685924
nowjs	node.js
but i would recommend looking into node.js and maybe even the nowjs plugging which allows for realtime updates via websockets

6685937
short	base
it is a short syntax for extending a base class

6686058
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
either use sudo preconfigure the web server user to run the exact command without passwd via visudo and prefix the command with sudo or set up a setuid script that executes the command on itself

6686064
post	get
this will generally mean that you will have to do some pre and post processing but allows you to quickly get to individual attributes

6686090
int	double
the percentage method takes a double but the pixel method only handles int

6686148
hibernate	jdbi
store as normalized columns from pojo use jdbi hibernate or even simple jdbc templates

6686149
tinyint	nvarchar
the list of available columns appears to be bigint binary bit datetime float image int money nchar ntext numeric nvarchar real rowversion smallint tinyint uniqueidentifier varbinary

6686220
folder	directory
if there is a change then the directory is further explored to find new album folder

6686235
folder	directory
i recommend using a nfs samba share or similar so that your public directory is actually just a networked folder so when you write to it it s like writing to the remote folder

6686236
put	get
you can put new customcollection into a loop and get the values 1..10

6686273
implements	extends
you can implements the custom behavior for a jaxb generated class basetype in a custom class basetypeext that extends the jaxb generated class basetype

6686281
post	get
get shouldn t have side effects so don t use get to make the reservation itself use something like post instead

6686303
width	height
in the example above the content in div a is hidden due to the width height restrictions

6686348
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
from the documentation on the ajax function from jquery s website the complete callback is passed two parameters jqxhr and textstatus where jqxhr is the actual xmlhttprequest object

6686349
fadein	fadeout
you can use jquery s fadein ref and fadeout ref to animate your opacity

6686355
put	get
this uri can be used by get to return the resource and updated with a put

6686355
post	put
post should be used to extend an existing resource and put for replacing the state of a resource

6686356
tcpclient	sslstream
the zero-byte read is fine but the sslstream decrypts the bytes leaving a zero byte-count in the tcpclient s buffer appropriately so and i cannot determine how many bytes are now in the sslstream available for reading

6686377
hide	show
i want to be able to show hide the rows in a table using jquery

6686381
folder	directory
got a folder at i have disabled directory browsing for that folder

6686385
folder	directory
however if you don t want to allow directory browsing at the folder level they ll need some link or way to get inward to the folder where you do allow browsing

6686392
concave	convex
however in the process the algorithm is bound to be able to classify shape a concave convex so you d likely be interested in the library nonetheless

6686392
concave	convex
since adrian japon more or less suggested that hit testing containment test is of a usual reason to care about convex concave geometries without further ado i ll highlight the corresponding boost geometry algorithm for that within

6686403
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
it has the same effect but this will work on any uibutton at any view depth my uibutton was several views deep and the uigesturerecognizer s delegate didn t have a reference to it.

6686459

6686506
int	boolean

6686552
uiview	subviews
in short i want both delegates the one from the nib file that i am working with and the subviews of the uiview control to get executed at the same time

6686559
folder	directory
change build products path for app and library to use .. build both project files are contained in sibling subfolders of a master directory so having them build into the same folder solved the original linker ld command problem i think

6686563
post	get
i left that one to continue doing a postback because i suspect at some point you want a regular post back all the other controls use ajax to get your server side response

6686581
google-chrome	firefox
its called javascript console in google-chrome but i know firefox has something similar

6686599
addclass	removeclass
i know that i can use removeclass and addclass to add and remove classes from different elements but i m looking to modify the global behavior of the entire class itself

6686655
post	get
you should have 2 controller actions one for rendering the login accessible on get form and one for handling the submission accessible on post and performing the actual authentication

6686690
width	height
width and max height of your table and simply leave some items free

6686723

annything you alloc copy or retain in your gameviewcontroller class you re supposed to release in the dealloc method and maybe also in the viewdidunload method if you re alloc copy retaining in the viewdidload method

6686763
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
there s a way to set pre tab width in firefox and opera but there isn t a well-known way to do this in ie or google-chrome and hard-tabbed code in pre tags suffers as a result

6686786
folder	directory
i have the following function that enumerates files and directory in a given folder

6686787
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
since you re asking for the whole thing including css here s a working demo requires css3 transition-capable browser such as google-chrome safari or firefox 4+

google-chrome	firefox
let the page render use ie or google-chrome or firebugs for firefox and press f12

6686793
mvp	presenter
yes i really have access to that button and it has the needed data even i could add some logic inside the control but to keep the software design web form mvp pattern i need to raise the event up to presenter and that s the mission i m involved in

an issue i have seen is i get an error when button is clicked if data list is bound within page load without check is postback is false i cannot post images yet sorry

6686916
subtract	add
you can only add not subtract padding to an element

6686917
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

6686943
rss	feed
i m following a tutorial and it s working fine but if i wanted to parse 2 rss feed it seems to overwrite one array instead of saving them in the respective arrays

6686957

i ll post some code for this when i get in front of the computer

6686963
width	height
all the pieces of the widget and tabcontainer have the correct width and height values

6686996
post	get
thankfully google s form can be also send using get method instead of post so whole action of adding bookmark maybe performed by opening url like the one below

6686996
width	height
amazingly if everything worked fine google serves back image star - like it was prepared specially for my bookmarklet - so we can use it to check if everything went correct - by checking for example if image s width or height exists and is equal to 15 px

6686996
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
during development of this bookmarklet in firefox 3.6 opera ie and google-chrome i had some versions without timeout using conditions like

6686996
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
different approach it should be very easy to create userscript for firefox with greasemonkey extension and for google-chrome opera that just automatically submits the form in popup - instead of using modified bookmarklet

6687049

when updating the parent entity i would like to set the collection of children to the new values without having to manually delete possibly deleting by parent id the old items on the collection

6687091

6687437
uiview	subviews
if it s the uiview themselves and the view controller has to identify itself first then i d suggest just adopting the delegate pattern wholesale rather than specialising to views and view controllers as you may want to build compound views that tie together logic from several subviews

pbkdf2	hash
for example if you wish to derive a key that is 64 bytes long and you wish to use sha-256 which produces 32-byte hash you will generate 2 pbkdf2 blocks

6687714
hash	hmac
each iteration uses sha-256 hmac again to hash the password p but uses the prior result as the hmac key

6687714
hash	hmac
when hmac is supplied a key your password in this case longer than the length of your hash output it will hash the key to get exactly 256 bits

6687714
pbkdf2	salt
in a sense these details are hidden from your implementation so you need not worry about how long a salt you re passing into pbkdf2

6687714
hash	salt	pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt
although because pbkdf2 applies your hash function a large number of times a long salt is less important than in traditional straight hashing applications. for my application i use a 32 byte random salt unique for each users account where i m hashing their password with pbkdf2

6687734

superclass	subclassing
so it is possible to write an attribute in a subclassing with the same attibute name as in the superclass but you can use different visibility modifier and type

6692366
superclass	subclassing
so i would say that the attributes in superclass and subclassing are almost completely independend from each other

6692366
superclass	subclassing
now if you really use the same attribute name in superclass and subclassing you effectively hide the superclass s attribute

6692366

width	height
scatterviewitems will autosize themselves based on their contents but in doing so enforce 2 restrictions a the initial height and width are large enough so that the user can comfortably grab the item to resize it and b the initial height and width are small enough that the item only takes up no more than 20 of each dimension of the screen leaving room for other items to be visible

passing an 8-bit signed chars will cause the value to be converted into a negative int resulting in an illegal negative offset into the internal arrays typically used by isxxxx

6693711
int	chars
however you must ensure that your chars is treated as unsigned when casting - you can t simply cast it directly to an int because if it s an 8-bit chars the resulting int would still be negative

6693711
int	chars
the typical way to ensure this works is to cast it to an unsigned chars and then rely on implicit type conversion to convert that into an int

6694178
msg	eml
it s been recommended to switch to the msg format using redemption instead of eml format to alleviate this but i believe that puts a prerequisite requirement on the user machine of either outlook or the mapi library..

6694178
msg	eml
but if the eml format isn t parsed the same by different products then maybe the msg format is the way to go

jboss	weblogic
you will still need an ejb container though such as weblogic server ibm was or jboss if you want to use ejbs

6695495
portrait	landscape
maybe if this really feels annoying to you go with a view flipper and move all the code that you can into seperate views inflating them from xml maybe if they arent too heavy you can load them both in oncreate and probably reuse a lot of the variables declared for the portrait view and the landscape

6695495

folder	directory
as described in the edit the issue occurred when trying to add virtual directory to a folder that is stored in the iis metabase as iisobject

6697073
folder	directory
i think what is happening is that when you add a virtual directory under a normal windows folder using the iis management console the windows folder needs to be added to the metabase too but it won t have any of its own properties

6697073
folder	directory
the way i found i could add a virtual directory to my main folder whilst it was still an iisobject though was to add the virtual directory as a child of the root folder but change the virtual directory name to include the main folder in its name like so

that being said the loss will be minor and obviously you ll gain the flexibility of being able to change the setter and getter at a later date such as if you end up making that value implicit such that it s not technically stored in memory or passing it off to a third object or doing something asynchronous to store that may require you to block on the getter in some circumstances

in that case you will have to decide whether to use a signed or unsigned integer type intptr_t or uintptr_t

6702212
min	max
the reason for the difference is that by design mysql allows columns in the select to not be stated in the group by or aggregate functions max min count etc

6702226

stateless	stateful
if the server does not hear the client anymore for some time period for example two times the heartbeat interval he can conclude that the client disconnected however this requires a stateful server and your design is stateless so it would require event processing in a secondary system which could be fed through a message queue

6706679
serializable	deserialization
it looks like serializable is case-sensitive what s the point in deserialization being not case-sensitive

6706994
gmail	hotmail
while i could talk about spf r-mx correct ptr records and mod_throttle the best advice is probably to go talk to a reputable provider who specialises in the field - and set up some hotmail and gmail addresses so you can monitor the service yourself

6707069
hash	md5
the concatenation of 2 md5 hash

the gluttimerfunc however only allows an integer amount of milliseconds to be set - so if i want 120 fps the closest i can get is resolution which equates to 125 fps i know it s a neglegible amount but i still just want to put in an fps limit and get exactly that fps if i know the system can render faster

6707510

my first idea was to create a session in the post method of the first registration form and check in the get method if the session exists

6707784

6708403
hide	show
the hidden attribute must not be used to hide content that could legitimately be show in another presentation

6708403
hide	show
for example it is incorrect to use hidden to hide panels in a tabbed dialog because the tabbed interface is merely a kind of overflow presentation â one could equally well just show all the form controls in one big page with a scrollbar

6708407

what i m trying to do is running a bteq script that gets data from a db then exports to a flat-file that flat file is picked up my a perl script the above code then with this post trying to get perl to import that file it gets into a fastload file

6708730
pathtoolongexception	argumentexception	notsupportedexception	argumentexception
unfortunately this particular method path.getfullpath was not designed well with those guidelines in mind so you need to handle argumentexception notsupportedexception and pathtoolongexception to validate the user input

6708769
width	height
the canvas width and height are set to the values of the display resolution

6708780
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
argumentnullexception inherits from argumentexception for instance

but is there any specific situation when while loops is better than for-loop

6710604
java.util.date	simpledateformat
simpledateformat does just what it sounds like it does it formats instances of java.util.date or in your case it converts the long value into the context of a java.util.date and it doesn t know what to do with intervals which is what you apparently are working with

so no there is no specific situation where one is better than the other although for readability reasons you should prefer a for-loop when you re doing simple incremental loops since most people can easily tell what s going on

6710639
for-loop	loops
when you know this before entering loops you can use for-loop

6710643
for-loop	loops
as for your question a for-loop is usually better when you want a piece of code to run a certain number of times and a while loops is better when the condition for the code to keep running is more general such as having a boolean flag that is only set to true when a certain condition is met in the code block

6710657
post	get
however when i use the following code i get an error 411 post requests require a content-length header

6710670
for-loop	while-loop
anything that a while-loop can do can also be done in a for-loop and anything a for-loop can do can also be done in a while-loop

6710685
post	get
you might get a better answer if you post more of your code

6710700
for-loop	loops
everything done with a for-loop can be done with a while loops but not

6710700
for-loop	loops
all while loops can be implemented with a for-loop

6710700
for-loop	loops
basically for loops are just short hand for while loops any for-loop can be converted from

6710707
google-chrome	firefox
it work nicely on ie8 firefox and google-chrome

6710707
google-chrome	firefox
also the font size don t appear to be the same as ie8 firefox and google-chrome

6710718
chown	chmod
assuming you have root access change the group chown on var www or better yet a sub directory to your group and change the permissions to allow your group write access chmod g+w

6710724
hide	show
my code works beautfiully it show when i need it to show and hide when i need it to go away

6710724
hide	show
the only problem is when a user clicks radio box within the group but the radio box does not have the correct value to show the container container ex my false condition jquery will very quick show the box then hide it again

6710757
pull	push
instead of having a push strategy where producers send directly messages to consumers you could use a pull strategy where consumers request messages from producers

6710809
stdout	stderr
i ve created a process and hooked the stdin stdout stderr file descriptors to ones i can read write and i actually drive the input and read the output

6710822
sorting	grouping
my question is better to do the grouping in sql server and return the last result and show it in c# report or get the data without grouping or sorting and do it in c# report you know in c# reports you can make grouping and chose what fields to grouping by

6710886
width	height
generally to align boxes vertically one of the best methods are to make em all block box so they can accept width and height then set the height of all of them to the highest box then try to vertical-align contents in each box

6710891
outputstream	inputstream
change inputstream outputstream to with self with dot syntax everywhere

6710902
capitalize	uppercase
typically the name starts with an uppercase i and then the rest is camel case where the first letter of each word is capitalize and the rest is lower case

6710932
hide	show
i have an existing flex application that uses databinding to show hide certain elements

6710932
hide	show
the problem with this is that while the show event plays perfectly the item disappears from view before the hide effect has a chance to play

6710957
mouse	keyboard
know i can select automatic mode it with the mouse on the assistant editor jump bar but i really want a keyboard shortcut to do this

6711042
post	get
basically you only need to use ssl when you post and get data from the server which are sensitive

6711084
children	parent
4 at any point in time the parent script must be able to accept messages from all of its children

6711084
children	parent
i thought of using rabbitmq and have the parent be a producer of the numpy array to its children

6711118
width	height
some objects have length width height depth

6711169
public	protected
furthermore you can set properties as public protected or private

6711180
datamodel	domain-model
i would suggest not worrying about your datamodel until you have defined you domain-model first

6711192
width	height
here is another example with what you gave length width height depth

6711222
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i have tried making the nsstring declaration to nsmutablestring .

6711235
rss	feed
they can range from adding a shortcode or fetching a rss feed to large blocks of code that duplicate functionality of commercial programs

6711257
nsmutablestring	nsstring
changing nsstring to nsmutablestring won t give you an nsmutablearray object

6711266
post	get
once the user submits the form its redirect to a page where i get the ids of the selected friends in order to post to their walls

6711273
int	chars
this example could be useful for int chars and string

6711294
children	parent
i can successfully cascade update children by simply calling session.update parent but i m having trouble doing the reverse

6711299
put	get
i am having an issue with one of the lines of code of my code and i don t know what to put to get it to work

6711300
hide	show
there can be two things can be done through jquery to do your things is just remove the attributed disabled disabled and on document ready use the hide and on doing some even again show you required input box the code to do that is as under

6711345
inherited	properties
that is if the visible properties of the parent control is set to false the child control inherited that setting and the setting takes precedence over any local setting .

6711355
gridview	rowdatabound
you can add a new cell in rowdatabound event of the gridview like below

6711383
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
only noticing this 1px issue in google-chrome tested in safari 5 firefox 5 also

6711390
jobs	cron
you need to look into cron jobs to automate script execution automatically

6711418
width	height
keep in mind you can put all sorts of stuff in the style now like text size height and width

6711440
src	attr
attr src signatures + #username png

6711444
midi	osc
i would use osc rather an midi

6711444
midi	osc
osc will let you deliver your data over ethernet at a much finer granularity than the ancient 3kb s venerable snail that is midi

6711444
midi	osc
you won t be sending midi notes via osc with a lot of success but you can do so much more

6711452
matplotlib	scipy
this book deals with numpy scipy matplotlib and other examples which are important for scientist

6711460
hide	show
i didn t copy all of your mockup and i used lists instead of divs but this answer will do what you need even using the show and hide by using the corresponding index in the parent methodology you are using

6711522
free	malloc
i don t know what operating system you re using but if this is linux i d suspect that chrome malloc is allocating memory from a program-managed heap size determined using the sbrk system call and the free lists are managed by the c standard library but when you reach a certain size threshold it switches to using mmap to ask the kernel to allocate large chunks of memory that don t interfere with the sbrk -managed heap

6711577
int	chars
also there are int values which do not map back to valid unicode or utf-16 strings which produce unpaired surrogates instead of valid chars

6711679
width	height
first i wrapped the iframe in a div and set the iframe s width and height to be 100

6711683
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
three arguments the jqxhr in jquery 1.4.x xmlhttprequest object a

6711689
getter	setter
i d be careful about overwriting the setchildren method as hibernate needs plain getter and setter

6711702
portrait	landscape
that s what i ve found as necessary in app i m making thought i need the picker to be in portrait but i need it to apply some ui changes if user rotate his device to landscape

6711750
stdout	stderr
i m writing a ruby script that will execute another piece of code capturing its stdout and stderr and writing them to a file

6711750
stdout	stderr
apparently in ruby at least stderr is unbuffered and stdout is buffered which in my case results in out-of-order output as the stderr lines get printed before some stdout lines

6711761
getter	setter
it s setter getter are not tied directly together

6711768
width	height
max width is 700px but you can have higher height .

6711771
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
on hover right now the box containing more information in yellow is being displayed correctly on google-chrome safari firefox and ie 8

6711777
hash	md5
an idea i ve had is to add an extra column to the table that holds an md5 hash of the contents of the other columns

6711777
hash	md5
when the xml is parsed the md5 hash is created of each advert and then added as a final column

6711777
hash	md5
once the records have been added 100k upwards to the table a query is run to identify any matching md5 hash but this takes too long and often times out the query even if the timeout has been extended

6711824
hash	md5
we use md5 hash to quickly identify rows and have hundreds of millions of rows of data so i would say this is an appropriate choice

6711826
clang	llvm
if you want to learn a little about the compiler internals for this without digging very deep look at llvm getelementptr this is exactly how a c++ compiler like clang would target llvm when compiling a struct reference

6711854
gridview	sqldatasource
i have gridview when i connect the sqldatasource and run the application data from stored procedure is shown but when i switch to design mode the schema does not loads in gridview

6711856
post	put
i m calculating the difference field by taking the grandtotal of the salesman s subtotals and subtracting them from the budget field that was put into the group footer since i m new i can t post images sorry

6711970
jax-ws	jax-rs
i dont need a lot of feature from glassfish full profile like jax-ws jaxb jax-rs .

6711973
width	height
and what would be really cool is if one could declare the column width and row height up above just like a grid

6712014
post	get
the first case of returning a list of ids isn t very helpful to you because then you need to make an api call for each id in order to get some information about that post

6712031
put	get
there are different types of requests get put etc but in all cases the response is just how the other end replies back whether it s with binary data images files etc html or an error code

6712031
httprequest	httpresponse
as for an httprequest and httpresponse these are just .net framweork objects that abstract away the details of reading the raw http data

6712060
tax	shipping
so on the cart page my customers can view the estimate shipping and tax area

6712060
tax	shipping
well i ve got the checkboxes in the template to display in the estimate shipping and tax when there is a freight item in the cart but i don t know much about the coshippingmethodform function so that i can add in the values of the checkboxes

6712072
getter	setter
of course since as noted in the documentation the generated getter and setter are only available at runtime the fields need to be declared public so the java compiler won t raise an error if code outside the class accesses the variable

6712072
getter	setter
better yet if you need specific logic in the getter or setter you can add it in

6712072
getter	setter
whether or not this is the right way to handle things is of course a matter of opinion but it s pretty common for java developers to look for easier ways of writing all those boilerplate getter and setter whatever it s relative merits groovy jython jruby and fantom all provide a mechanism for creating and accessing properties that results in syntax similar to what play is achieving

6712087
hide	show
for example i have a items.js in which i show some things on the screen but i want to hide all of those items when the user activates something in a phone.js

6712112
width	height
for input text i d suggest listening for the event.change event then updating the width height based on the number of lines the .textwidth or textlinemetrics info mytextfield.getlinemetrics

6712117
pascal	delphi
i tagged as delphi pascal because it s what i am working in atm but this could apply to all programming i guess

6712146
post	get
you would have to read in all http request headers and get post data in your python server process and then set them in the environment used by your php script

6712168
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
before setting a doctype this worked beautifully on google-chrome firefox safari mobile and opera

6712185
versioning	upgrade
i already upgrade too the latest vb6 versioning which is still quite old and made sure the file was in the right folder

6712190
postgresql	mysql
i created a small django patch that implements connection pooling of mysql and postgresql via sqlalchemy pooling

6712217
width	height
width and row height up above just like a grid

6712258
for-loop	arrays
in one of the answers to matlab linked list the responder suggests using java linked lists which seems like an excellent solution but it is not clear what an elegant way is to convert the linkedlist once constructed to a matlab cell arrays i guess one have a for-loop but that seems a little clunky.

6712303
hide	show
in case that site ever goes down essentially what you are going to need to investigate is using the hover selector to show and hide various parts of the menu at any given time

6712319
button	right-align
a right-align fixed width button looks better imho

6712352
hide	show
my intention was to hide the farbtastic feature but when the use doubleclick the textarea input the farbstastic feature show up

6712378
children	parent
then add the child node to the parent node s list of children

6712411
opera	firefox
this specific use case works best with css transitions plus you get free opera and firefox 3.5+ support

6712440
post	get
if my guess is wrong please post more code so we can get an idea of what the problem is

6712521
public	protected
in languages like c# or vb the standard is to start private things with lowercase and start public protected things with uppercase

6712526
post	put
you might think to simply put status update in the stream talking about the post however the graph api is also limited to 25 such direct feed post per day per app to prevent spamming

6712526
post	get
one solution would be to post to something like flickr get the url of the image and then post to the wall

6712538
post	get
if you can post code i can get more specific

6712546
width	height
the image has varying height and width and size-wise 4-30kb png files

6712547
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
to handle serialization use objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

6712617
profiling	debugging
if it helps you can enable profiling over local areas of code by using the debugging api

6712636
int	chars
go through the string one chars at a time get the index of the responsible int if you only have alphabetic chars you can have a be at index 0 and get that index by subtracting any a to z by a just as an example of how you can get reasonably fast indices and increment the value in that index

6712643
int	chars
create another int array of size 26 say freq and str is the array of chars

6712688
post	get
it s a standard get xml when done fire an event and then post the first attribute to a node in the class variable text

6712703
gridview	sqldatasource
the consuming dropdownlist the label with the parameter and the sqldatasource are all within a gridview edittemplate

6712708
int	chars
you can use a java map and map a chars to an int

6712736
pyramid	cherrypy
i ve looked at pyramid cherrypy and some other more minimalistic web frameworks but i just can t choose

6712765
post	get
i have a custom http component that uses wininet to handle http post and get

6712862
prepare	execute
the framework uses prepare statements so actually this is the real query - in reality its send to the database which parses it and then the params are binded to it and execute

6712864
hide	show
here is a hiding column model that will hide show columns based on the return value of the fieldhasdata method.

6712886
folder	directory
under libraries click new folder and browse to the directory you want to include

6712891
stdout	fflush
maybe you need to fflush stdout like this

6712911
post	put
i created a sample mvc3 app and put it on github which in part was based on cary s work found in a forum post

6712915
mef	prism
mef or prism might fix my problem

6712923
jboss	glassfish
the project was in netbeans apparently associated with a server which is already bundled with jsf such as glassfish jboss etc

6712991
fadein	fadeout
use fadeout and fadein method

6713095
pull	push
if you write an app to pull push data to a sharepoint site you can use 3.5

6713160
hide	show
you could put all the circles and texts into one uiview so you only have to hide and show this view when the user taps on help

6713238
jwindow	jdialog
by follows this tutorial i can image that by creating un-decorated fully translucent jframe jdialog my favorite would be just jwindow which is un-decorated by default heavens this container lost from swing tutorial

6713257
dictionary	map
i have an entity of type contact and i m trying to map a list of these to a dictionary

6713258
apache	nginx
you can try to handle it with nginx or apache or you can use this hacky solution using rack

6713277
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in ie9 firefox google-chrome etc

6713381
client-side	server-side
in your question this pattern allows each external client-side script to use at least its own localization settings and also allows server-side code to render that parameter as a side effect of rendering the element itself

6713411
rss	feed
for creating rss feed i simply have haml views that render to the proper xml

6713422
serializable	deserialization
custom serializable deserialization is necessary

6713432
width	height
colourswitchermapmark accidentally picks up a height and width of 256px from this rule

6713437
puts	gets
when a file is found it calls filefound which then gets the strings and puts them into a vector

6713457
ftp	smb
an example would be uploading files to a ftp or smb share i attempted this below

6713458
width	height
the solution is to limit the div by specific width and height

6713509
google-chrome	firefox
this is happening across browsers google-chrome 12 firefox 5 and ie 8

6713521
hash	salt
however from what i ve read about cryptography that is a rather naã ve way to generate salt hash but if you re doing it wrong when typing a-e-s in your source code i figured the same could be true in this case

6713533
implements	extends
my basic approach was to replace all h1-h6 tags using a regex and prepend them with which i implements by extends the tcpdf class

6713548
google-chrome	firefox
i d like to also be able to access these files for times when i run this application inside a regular browser like firefox or google-chrome

6713618
hash	salt
for most of the salt password schemes smd5 ssha the salt is stored after the password hash and its length can vary

6713619
width	height
the problem is while inside oncreate onresume methods my imageview have width and height 0

6713633
getter	setter
for other class methods it s better to use the setter getter so i can use .

6713633
viewdidload	dealloc	viewdidload	viewwillappear
as far as i know the behavior is the same than in my example so i should use the setter get method in the viewdidload or viewwillappear and released it in the dealloc without self

6713639
maven	pom.xml
basically here is a maven pom.xml that s a submodule in the multi-module project described above

6713642
tostring	getter
12 2011 00 00 00 if the getter returns date struts will do a tostring on the getter value

6713642
getter	setter
so you actually need the date field with both a setter getter of type date and a setter getter of type string

6713662
division	modulo
the modulo returns the remainder of the division i 2

6713697
for-loop	loops
when odd is initialized before loops consider the implicit index i in a traditional for-loop to be -1

6713730
multiplying	add
but if you only want to calculate down to the second digit for monetary purposes for example use an integer as if you are using cents as unit and add some scaling logic when you are multiplying dividing

6713777
x86	64bit
inside the guest vm run the version of msvsmon that came with your copy of visual studio 2010 a setup package for just the remote deubgging stuff can be found on the disc image use x86 if debugging a 32-bit process or x64 if debugging 64bit one itanium if you need to laugh

6713779
post	get
the reason for this is because standard html helpers such as textboxfor first look for values present in the modelstate post get requests values and if they find the value there they will use it

6713804
post	get
a session identifier passed via a get or post request or passed via a

6713824
submit	submission
2 when submission high scores submit the device s current time

6713834
pop-up	dialog
when a user clicks on an item in the list it will pop-up with an edittext dialog box

6713879
nowjs	node.js
deprecated nowjs is a framework built on top of node.js a javascript server technology

6713887
stdout	stderr
the reason this works is that by default the python interpreter uses the ascii codec for stdin stdout and stderr

6713916
mouse	keyboard
while the aut is blocked it isn t responding to keyboard or mouse input

6713933
firefox	safari
both safari and firefox were run on the same computer however on firefox 5.0.1 the balls jump from place to place rather than moving continuously

6713938
public	protected
in c++ nested classes are really just a way of scoping namespaces and providing protection public protected private for class names

6713981
ceil	floor
if your c library is so old that it lacks a trunc function specified in c99 you can easily implement one based on floor and ceil specified in c89

6713986
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but in ie9 the adjacent side image appears to overlap with the pop-up image

6714062
imperative	declarative
if the latter is it possible to package that into a behavior and be able to load that declarative later on or am i stuck with imperative code forever

6714074
getter	setter
for other class methods it s better to use the setter getter so i can use self.vara .

6714074
viewdidload	dealloc	viewdidload	viewwillappear
as far as i know the behavior is the same than in my example so i should use the setter get method in the viewdidload or viewwillappear and released it in the dealloc without self

6714077
google-chrome	firefox
into the yui parser to get it to work in firefox win as well as google-chrome

6714088
firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox safari and opera mobile browsers have the ability to be inspected though their desktop counterparts

6714092
put	get
when you get large you should put you active dataset in a in-memory database faster than disc just like facebook twitter etc do

6714092
memcached	apc
both use memcached for this but you could also use redis i like this or apc if you are just a single box

6714103
rss	feed
i m using the code above to display text from an rss feed

6714126
post	get
additionally if you can confirm that the user meant to execute the script he she sent then you should also be protected from attackers if you will only run script typed onto the page and never script submitted via get or post data or if you include some kind of unique token with those requests to confirm that the request originated with your website

6714154
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
seems to work in opera and google-chrome but not in ie9 ff5 or safari

6714294
hide	show
for example there are many different types of log records typea_log typeb_log etc. the user should have the ability to select deselect these types which will show hide them from the display

6714294
hide	show
all i really want to do in most cases is show hide certain things

6714336
post	get
also have a look at post redirect get

6714341
post	put
it also is generally done through put post delete request

6714341
post	put
in the php frameworks post would be the easiest most common as put and delete take a good deal more effort for complete support in php

6714353
gridview	sqldatasource
for editing in the gridview it is simplest just to use a dropdownlist with it s own sqldatasource or custom data source which is bound to equipment.equipmenttypeid something like this

6714365
hash	md5
remember that md5 was engineered as a cryptographic hash and speed wasn t the foremost goal for this actually many modern secure hash are made slow by design

6714410
width	height
we have autoresizing masks set for width and height

6714456
implements	extends
public class painloggeractivity extends activity implements onclicklistener

6714463
width	height
an alternative solution would be to remove the width and height of the border as you add it like so

6714465
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
tested in mozilla firefox 5.0 ie9 opera 11.50 and chromium google-chrome 12.0.742.112

6714466
folder	directory
to reduce the risk make sure the data files are stored in a sub directory programfiles myapp data or something like that and don t grant normal users write access to folder with .exe or .dll s

6714491
folder	directory
i found this post on stackoverflow which was exactly what i wanted to integrate into a larger script i am writing find the newest folder in a directory in python

6714515
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome and firefox

6714564
submit	submission
so if a user inputs the dog walked and pressed submit the form would add across the street. to the end of the submission

6714570
puts	gets
another issue is since im processing emails which are horribly formatted sometimes the url ends up at the end of the line where it gets broken up between 2 lines which puts an equal sign at the end like so

6714574
put	get	post	get	post	put
the test controller is not actually processing a url it is setting up the test using one of the 5 supporting request types get post put head delete and then calling the appropriate controller action

6714584
queue	fifo
stack s should be used when you need lifo semantics while queue s should be used when you need fifo semantics

6714587
portrait	landscape
i am writing an android app with three tabs two designed in portrait mode and one a mini-spreadsheet in landscape mode

6714597
put	get
get put and delete are fine

6714625
width	height
you can have an in memory 2d boolean array with the size of the canvas pixels width height

6714633
put	get
i understand why it moves but after trying a wide variety of positioning styles i just can t figure out how to get it to stay put

6714733
rss	feed
i have a tableview that shows a list of rss feed in it s cells some times the list can get to long so i need to show like 15 items then have a bottom cell with load more

6714741
int	chars
i would recommend using an array of chars instead of an array of strings - then when you ask the user for input and he enters say 1 3 - you can simply either declare two int and use them

getter	setter
avoid internal getter setter

6716442

6716573

6718378
width	height
file size width x height x bit depth + metadata overhead

one possible path to take is to convert the double into int in some fashion but i don t know enough about how the random library works to know whether this can be done in a fashion that really preserves the bell shape and the mean std

6718735
children	parent
if you have no intention to get return values from your child processes you should set the sigchld signal handler in the parent process to sig_ign to have the kernel automatically reap your children

6718745
inherited	properties
the intended way to make elements inherited properties from others is by relying on the cascade

6718825
csharpcodeprovider	reflection.emit
as i understand it there are at least two ways of doing runtime code generation - if you re comfortable using il you can use reflection.emit otherwise you can use a csharpcodeprovider which enables you to compile code at runtime from strings or from a series of objects which describe code in a dom style

6719804
glulookat	glrotate
if you are writing an application that has the concept of the camera moving and rotating too i suppose then rather than operating on the object with glrotate and gltranslate consider looking into glulookat which allows you to set things up in a camera-centered way so to speak
