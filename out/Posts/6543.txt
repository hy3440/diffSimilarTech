if you compile via the llvm backend -fllvm that also takes advantage of the fact that you always divide by a single known number 10 and converts the division into multiplication and bit-shift

16324458

for-loop	loops
this form is computationally exactly equivalent to what we now colloquially know as â œiterationâ namely a finite loops such as a for-loop with a fixed lower and upper bound

16327747
int	chars
i also know that int accepts 9 digits which i was wrong the range int is between -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647 so if we cast every number between 0-max int range to a chars there will be many many symbols

16344737
svg	vml
once i actually looked at the page source using the debugger i found out that google charts and any other javascript charting library for that matter uses vml instead of svg for charts

for-loop	loops
break out of loops when you find the name and use the else suite for the for-loop instead

16345116
for-loop	loops
else on a for-loop only is executed if you exhausted the iterable so when you did not break out of loops early

children	parent
as mentioned in the answers and comments to this question there is currently no way to make the parent element receive styling based on its children

the codes may not be consecutive but if they re fairly dense the likelihood a number between min keys and max keys exists is high say over 75 you might be able to save some space by pre-constructing a object of size max keys -min keys and using it like a map

16345798
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
in my 2d tiled game i have a problem when i update all the object from a 2d arrays in a for-loop inside another looping in the 2d arrays from top left to bottom right row by row like the code below if the program is looping at index 5 6 and it need data from the object under itself it ll use the new data that he have executed when loops is at 5 5 but i want to use the all data before the start of the double for loop.

the outer for-loop automates the input for each date.there s no need to repeat the same code for each date as you did.if the number of dates goes up it will be tedious.further the do-while loops asks the user for the date in the range specified.if that jerk makes an error he is yelled at and the condition of that loops makes sure the jerk has to enter again.the two dates are stored in an arrays and the base address of type is passed as an argument to the function larger which compares the two dates and returns a pointer of type to the larger date.this is used to store the greater date in a new datastructure called largerdate and then printed out

folder	directory
if you are running this locally you could create a folder named public_html in your home directory structure and set this to run your scripts you would just have to configure that also mapping it to that location

width	height
# initial width height

16379622
width	height
# target width height

16379709
width	height
the normalisation process basically adjusts x y width height so that the document is considered to be 1000 in height

16379709
width	height
it also of course considers the proportions of the width height of the document as part of this process

16379723
rss	feed
i notice that apps like zite show articles with full text and images but if you go onto any of these sites rss feed they only have maybe a summary of the text and an article title

16379733
isotope	masonry
that seems odd as this affects everyone who uses a masonry isotope and lightbox combo being able to advance via a lightbox in the newly sorted order instead of the original page order

16379740
width	height
if you really want a fixed width and height using autolayout then i think you need to add those constraints

16379740
width	height
in your storyboard you can pin the width and height of your view hook them up to your controller as you did for the spacing above and when you re ready set the size of the constraint

16379740
width	height
here is a screenshot showing a centered view with fixed height and width using autolayout

16379759
lisp	scheme	cdr	cons
a list in scheme is either the empty list also known as nil in some lisp or a cons cell whose car also known as first is an element of the list and whose cdr also known as rest is either the rest of the list another list or an atom that terminates the list

16379759
cdr	cons
that s rather clunky though so most lisps all that i know of have a special case for printing cons cells if the cdr is a list either another cons cell or then don t print the

margin	height
you will have to remove the margin or adjust the height on .header-top-search-wrapper

rss	feed
what you re after is full site rss and as you ve guessed those feed come from services that scrape sites

16379840
children	parent
when you reach the last level no children added to queue you can print the whole path easily because the last printed node is on one longest path and you have the parent links

16379956
put	get
now put this in a batch just so we get both data sets in one go

16379963
inherited	properties
refer to ecma-335 partition i 8.10.3 properties and event inherited

16380000
margin	height
that way you will be able to clear the floats with a clearfix div as if correctly relatively positioned and if you keep your clearfix div transparent the height you give it will serve as margin

16380007
mongoose	mongojs
what would be different if i run node.js without mongoose mongojs

16380007
mongoose	mongojs
i can t find any good explanation of the big picture of how mongoose or mongojs fits together with node.js

16380007
mongoose	mongojs
btw i think mongoose and mongojs are doing the same type of thing for node.js interchangeable but this page seems to be describing mongojs quite differently from mongoose simple driver that emulates the mongodb api as much as possible. so i might be wrong in putting mongoose and mongojs together

16380028
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i don t know what the right condition should be on a for-loop that loops through an arrays that will have a varying length depending on how many rows are in a table that i pull from and add to the arrays

16380028
for-loop	arrays
the arrays currently has three rows but the for-loop only prints out two

16380059
opengl-es	glkview
i haven t done much work with glkit myself i ve preferred lower-level opengl-es mainly out of habit but i believe you set up the opengl-es context for your glkview at some point

for questions which relate the system notification area or system tray in general use the notification-area or system-tray tag instead

16380081
instances	transient
in your case your lifetime scoped instances refers to a transient and you seem to be aware of the possible risk of this and you seem to have checked that this is not problem

16380081
instances	transient
for instances you can promote the transient dependency to lifetime scope but you have probably already considered this

16380159
folder	directory
on windows merely having the native .dll in the same folder as the .jar file works but i m told that on unix systems like mac this doesn t work as unix by default does not load libraries from the current working directory unless otherwise instructed

width	height
all of the get functions fps length width height all return zero

16380227
int	chars
it has to take the form of a string with at most 20 chars and two int all separated by a space

16380280
width	height
obviously the solution here only renders correctly points that were registered on the same rendered-size image at the same screen resolution etc - it could probably be amended to store fractions of image width height for a solution that works across images resolutions

16380285
google-chrome	firefox
it happens in google-chrome and firefox

16380293
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome version 26.0.1410.64 m firefox version 20.0.1 internet explorer version 9.0

16380410
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
first set your image width and height with percentages allowing enough space for the frame around the edges and use position relative to add a percentage offset from the top rather than setting a margin

16380410
width	height
at that point you can override the width and height of the container in your media queries and the images and frames will all adjust themselves appropriately

16380410
width	height
i m not exactly sure what you intended to do with the layout as the window size changed but your current media query that sets the width to 100 and height to auto is definitely not going to work

16380441
width	height
gluperspective 60. width height 0 1000

16380451
hide	show
i just want the handle display by default use it to show or hide the panel

16380469
stdout	stdio
that s because the stdio library detects that stdout is a terminal and does a write of its buffer on every newline

16380469
stdout	stdio
this is because the the stdio library sees that stdout is a pipe and switches to block buffered mode

16380500
screens	tablet
i want to make the image fill the screens width also in tablet

16380518
post	get
i ve been looking over the aptana download page and it looks like they used a bit of javascript to detect the settings of the os and then instead of doing a get request they do a post of the data

16380520
post	get
my question is can we invoke the google.com in post action method passing this string and get the top 3 urls from that result page or do we need to use scripting on the view page

16380522
post	get
and then send it with the headers when making a get or post request on your webapi methods

16380530
post	get
for instance they can get the http post request and do all the conversion to you in a transparent way

16380531
equals	gethashcode
to make it work for your custom struct you will need to do one of two things either override gethashcode and equals to be able to use execpt with your struct

16380558
post	get
i m trying to forward a request to another spring controller that takes a get request but it s telling me post is not supported

16380563

i am using a tcplistener to listen for a connection a tcpclient to accept the connection a streamreader and streamwriter attached to a networkstream to send receive data

16380921

16380981
elementname	datagrid
you can get hold of the itemsource by binding back to the datagrid you could use findancestor or simply name your datagrid and use elementname in the multibinding

16380992
portrait	landscape
your code behaves as you expect it to in untransformed portrait mode and only throws up strange results when in landscape or portrait-upsidedown

16381058

my only problem is i need to keep the sub-folders as folder from the main directory

16381292

you need to use the undocumented 2nd input to heatmap that indicates whether a plot should be created or not and a few other handle graphics tricks to get the handle to the figure that is created

16381337
spaces	delimiter
i m trying to read in a line of spaces delimiter integers and parse them into ultimately into a linked list a vector

16381428
qobject	qwidget
qlineedit is a qwidget which is a qobject

16381433
stdout	stderr
your index method does not work because python --version outputs its version to stderr not stdout

16381433
stdout	stderr
if you don t need to separate these streams you may just redirect stderr to stdout

16381433
stdout	stderr
if you want to separate stderr from stdout use the open3 module

16381453
min	max
if you supplied your own custom min and max slider images your fudge factor would probably equal the left and right cap inset on the resizable image

16381533
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the only difference i can point out is that the uinavigationcontroller is initiated within the relevant uiviewcontroller and the tabbar is initialized in the appdelegate

16381533
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
also this control is subclassed from a uiviewcontroller not a uitabbarcontroller

16381548
postorder	inorder
the rule for drawing pre-order postorder and inorder is

16381554

try-catch	exception-handling
but hell i just don t understand why should i wrap each and every call from web modules to ejb in a try-catch block or create exception-handling handlers looking for javax.ejb.ejbaccessexception as a root cause and generate 403 server response code by hand in case user s credentials don t meet security constraints for a specific ejb method

16381994
range	max
if the input is guaranteed to be a valid range the last test or max is unneccessary

16382022
accessor	properties
your inference is understandable since the types of local variables are usually only accessed by means of a runtime object however it is flawed because if you access a nullable object at runtime via a properties accessor then its behavior will be equivalent to that of a local variable

inside of oncreate after setcontentview

16382131

take a look at the first three step of this blog post i wrote on google maps api v2 to get an idea of how to do it correctly

16382383
free	malloc
a simple solution would be to go through one cycle using an allocator which does nothing other than wrap malloc free together with a counter which keeps track of current memory usage and maximum usage

16382417
free	malloc
more precisely the same sequence of malloc free operations is

16382439
prepare	execute
you ended your procedure definition with before your prepare and execute

16382439
prepare	execute
the specific reason for the error is that your prepare statement and execute statement are not separated by the delimiter currently in effect when you run them

16382439
prepare	execute
to fix both problems just move the line with after the prepare and execute

16382444

16382653
union	distinct
union means union distinct so there is no need for the 3-level nesting and the extra count can be done with the with rollup modifier

16382653
union	distinct
the most expensive part of this query will be the union because you need distinct and the group by operations

16382653
union	distinct
if you want efficiency it would be much better to have a separate table with all distinct language and word combinations and then group by on that table no union would be needed

16382663

i think you are looking for super which lets you overwrite extends or prepend any class s method by calling super on its type

16383180
width	height
i tried it with this tutorial but the problem is that i have to use fixed width for the borders and the triangle should have the height of the content dynamically adjusted

now when i execute the above program i enter the value of c as ã which is in the spanish chars set and is typed as alt + 160 in windows and because my computer implements the plain old chars as a signed chars the above program outputs the int value of ã as -96 but a strange thing happens when i output the value of m it returns the output as -19 instead of -84 while if i execute the following program -

slideup	slidedown
i tried to implement it using slideup slidedown and visible binding

16383782
slideup	slidedown
the difference is that with slideup slidedown the contained markup always remains in the dom and always has its data-bind attributes applied - the visible binding just uses css to toggle the container elementâ s visibility

either get rid of the loop in your template or wrap the user entity in a list and put that list into the setter variable

16384313

16384382
width	height
all that is relevant is that svgdrawable renders content based on the contents of an .svg file and that the intrinsic width height is considered to be the original .svg document s width and height

16384382
width	height
it all works perfectly well except for the one small issue in that the svgdrawable is asked to draw its image using the intrinsic width and height rather than some width and height that fits within the actionbarsherlock

16384382
width	height
the svgdrawable s getintrinsicheight returns the original height of the svg document and the same goes for the width and therefore if for instance the original svd document is 300px square then that s what the svgdrawable will be rendered at

16384382
width	height
for my situation the only work-around i can think of is to add a method like setintrinsicdimensions int width int height which would basically override the dimensions read from the original svg document

16384382
width	height
i suppose that when adding the svgdrawable programmatically to the actionbarsherlock i would also call this method and supply a suitable width and height where the height is the height of the actionbarsherlock minus some padding

rbac	acl
the most used in web development are acl access control list and rbac role based access control

16384964
rbac	acl
to give you an idea of how they work look at the examples from zend framework acl and rbac

16384964
rbac	acl
in zend framework the acl is not very different from a rbac because it also has roles

16384964

alloca	malloc
i also tried accessing the allocated memory in one stack frame in other stack frame by passing the pointer to memory allocated in one stack frame to the other function call another stack frame so that the memory allocated in one frame can be used in other call just to verify if the compiler is not internally converting the malloc to alloca which could have been the reason for large stack frames but that didn t make any difference

for-loop	loops
in a for-loop the value of datum will be automatically reset to the next value from the range as soon as loops begins again

16385206
for-loop	loops
though a while loops will not update datum automatically like for-loop does you ll have to increase it yourself otherwise your code will stuck in an infinite loops

16385227
strcpy	strncpy
regardless to copy the strings prefer strncpy to the unsafe strcpy

just add all the numbers in the arrays together in a for-loop and then divide by the length of the arrays

16385237
strncmp	strcmp
just taking a guess i have removed the strncmp and changed it to strcmp which may be one of the reason either the target or the ploc- name is failing to provide maxnum number of characters

i was able to fix the height problem at least in ff by adding margin auto to the image but the width problem remains

actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .

16388203
udp	tcp
enet is good because it provides the benefits of both worlds - the reliability of tcp and the freedom and light weight of udp

16388203
udp	tcp
there is nothing wrong with the fact that enet internally uses only udp and not tcp because enet is able to provide almost everything that tcp does and much more

width	height
as for answering your question if you set width to 100 the image width will be inherited from the container div and the height would depend on the actual height of the image

16396720
width	height
for a image of height less than the width of the container div the height will be less than the image width while for an image with height more than the container div s width the image height will be more than the image width.the aspect ratio will be conserved though

16396720
width	height
if you don t want to conserve the aspect ratio just set width and height of image

innodb	myisam
a last suggestion is to convert your db from myisam to innodb but i think this requires some investigation because it not always the case that innodb is faster

16397869
innodb	myisam
with innodb there is less time lost from table locking while myisam is faster in table readings

16397872

this can also be achieved by a combination of slideup slidedown functions

16398560
int	double
when wpf tries to use this default value it tries to unbox it to a double since the property is declared as double which fails because the boxed value is an int not a double

16398560
int	double
a boxed value can only be unboxed to its actual type the usual implicit numeric conversions like int to double don t work in this case

16398572
getter	setter
if you don t want the private data pointers to be modified then you don t provide setter only the getter

16398587
int	double
the default value is stored as a reference boxed int and later the property tries to get the default value as the specified type double

append implements onclicklistener to mainactivity extends activity and this should work

16402984
post	get
additionally for http request methods that can cause side-effects on user data in particular for http methods other than get or for post usage with certain mime types the specification mandates that browsers preflight the request soliciting supported methods from the server with an http options request header and then upon approval from the server sending the actual request with the actual http request method

16403026
post	get
you are using a post request afterall so the snumber parameter doesn t belong in the url as it would with a get request agent details 3

here s an updated version of the original demo replacing the image with a span with a blue background that may demonstrate a little more clearly how the underlying problem exists in google-chrome and safari as well

16403279
post	get
you have to be knowledgeable about how the post get patch requests work in all circumstances and it s not very oop-y

16403279
post	get
this way you save yourself some clunkiness by only having to write the api get post logic in the private methods of the object class instead of littered throughout your application

16403279
put	get
you would also write a save method which does the appropriate api patch put request behind the scenes to sync with the database back-end -- or perhaps override your get set attribute methods on the class to retrieve and save changes on-the-fly without invoking an asynchronous save method

16403283
portrait	landscape
that being said if you are trying to lock your application into landscape mode there are multiple other issues here â for instance your supportedinterfaceorientations lists only portrait modes not landscape

16403316
strlen	strstr
the thing i see is that you allocate bufsiz bytes to the buffer and you read up to bufsiz bytes into the buffer but you are trying to use a strstr and a strlen on the buffer.

16403316
printf	strlen
i would suggest you allocate bufsiz+1 and memset stringa 0 bufsiz+1 to guard against a random walk through memory by strlen which would produce some pretty undefined behaviors in the while loop and could also result in the printf within the loop behaving oddly or at least use for the output

16403317

16403511
folder	directory
it is always a good idea while using mvc to keep all assets folder css js and images in root directory rather than keeping inside application or any other folder and accessing them using base_url

16403538
width	height
instead of specifying width and height you can use the anchor and dock properties to have controls scale based on their containing elements

in short given a fully-immutable persistent data structure a transient version of it will make changes using destructive allocation-efficient mutation which you can flip back into a proper persistent data structure again when you re done with your performance-sensitive operations

16406792
persistent	transient
it is only at the transition back to a persistent data structure that new roots are created for example thus amortizing the attendant cost over the number of logical operations you performed on the structure while it was in its transient form

filtering	grouping
if your users don t like it because they all want their own columns then just add some filtering at the top so they can filtering to their grouping of choice

16407473
width	height
it is smaller than the background width or height so self.view.backgroundcolor is not going to work for me

if you use qdialog as a base class it will share it s parent taskbar entry don t forget to set the parent also setting qt dialog as window flag should do the trick for a qwidget

16407694
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
it looks like in the wpf version of caliburn.micro it successfully binds the viewmodel to a window object but in trying the same thing in silverlight causes issues

16407710
google-chrome	firefox
the issue i ran into is when i put in my login credentials firefox and google-chrome pop out a save password option and i think it acts like a page

the error i get back is that it takes the first line of the file to be split little.sam and tries to name f like that followed by alignments_ 5 .sam those last three put together correctly

16407728
entities	entitymanager
first you should really only be querying the entitymanager s local cache because this is the only place that added entities will be found

16407728
children	parent	entities	entitymanager
the other approach that might be even simpler is based on the idea that if you have already linked the parent entities to the children via a foreign key then any entities in the entitymanager cache will already have their navigation properties resolved

16407733
ant	maven
once i participated in development of such maven plugin under the same circumstances - migration from ant to maven delta builds

16407733
ant	maven
however in my opinion our decision to write maven plugin instead of supporting old ant scripts was right

16407733
ant	maven
testing and support of ant code is quite expensive and integration with maven adds even more complexity

16407748

the bottom line is that you need to use createchildview inside of the view you will be creating the child in so that proper parent - children hierarchy is created

16407883
hide	show
how in out show hide toggle number

16407885
width	height
the outer div had display inline-block so the image would expand the div to its minimum height width 100 so it takes up all the width of the parent and position relative so the text can be absolutely aligned with the logo

16407897
strsplit	do.call
i ve spent a few hours trying to figure out the right permutation of do.call daply strsplit and so on but i m not getting anywhere

then i was free to tack on additional children as needed later on as the parent had already been created

16407963
inherited	subclassing
abstract classes are non-reactive you can t pattern match them and this behavior is inherited by subclassing so you have to explicitly enable this in the subclassing

16407988

your bundle needs to be registered in arp so the user can uninstaller it and clean up the package cache that burn maintains

16408013

16408213
width	height
assuming your m represents the height of your matrix and n represents the width overloading operator this way should do the trick

16408255
maven	pom.xml
i have made some modifications to log4j and would like my project to use my local version rather than that from the remote maven repo so i declared my project as a local repo in pom.xml in addition to my remote repo for other dependencies

16408347
vbscript	vba
the most convenient way to automate a running instance of excel is probably vba or vbscript but you can still use python with pywin32 or pywinauto

16408347
bmp	png
if it s important to stick with python and it s acceptable to generate .xlsx instead of .xls your best bet is xlsxwriter which lets you import jpeg or png in addition to bmp

mouseup	mousedown
just had to make one change in the new treeview though mouseup is overriden instead of mousedown

16408533
put	get
only a short question here i would like to know the best place to put my registration code for the user that i get back from the server

16408632
post	get
manually navigating to that address throws the error because when manually navigating you are doing a get and your method only allows post s

16408670
jython	pypy

i m trying to call a javascript method in a java code but i get many errors so i put the method in the main to check it so i get this in the console sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.interpretedfunction

16408768

int	double
i ll quickly describe the real life situation too in case the answer to my question is you ll probably never want to do this. i simply want to write a class that parses command line arguments strings into various data types int double bool etc.

16408848
google-chrome	firefox
all of a sudden there is a horizontal scroll bar on firefox i don t see it on ie or google-chrome though

pull	push
this has benfits like the ability to git pull and git push without having to specify the repository and branch name

16408938
width	height
changing the width and height of a canvas with css is supposed to distort it without changing the intrinsic size just the same as with any other image

16408943
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i thought that subclassing does not inherited superclass constructor

16408945
width	height
not sure if it s the recommended approach but instead of bootstrapping showing a usercontrol you can bootstrap show a window instead and then set height width etc

16408950
int	boolean
the problem is just with returning single primitive values int boolean or their wrapper classes

16408958
superclass	subclassing
then you can hold onto it in a reference to a superclass because a subclassing is an instance of a superclass

16408989
octree	quadtree
useful keywords for searching are bsp tree quadtree octree

16409000
subtract	add
i then want to repeat the script and correct the bearing initially calculated with the correction factor simple add or subtract x degrees

post	get
i m looking to get a regex working in python that captures all of the message within a facebook post but then stops instead of returning the rest of the json textline

16409066
min	max	range	max	range	min
you could forgo the calculation of those two variables for the range of y values as the calculations are being done but just wait until all of the operations are done and then do one final iteration through the entire result set and calculate the min and max then

16409106
google-chrome	firefox
and it even works without either in google-chrome and firefox

16409142
int	chars
the ignore is required because extraction into the int will leave the following n chars in the stream

superclass	subclassing
in the first line a superclass keeps the instance of subclassing

16409149
maven	pom.xml
i have a dynamic web application that i ve converted to a maven project in spring toolsuite eclipse basically. the project now has a pom.xml file but the java build path no longer has the jars i used to use because maven is supposed to handle the dependencies

google-chrome	firefox
it s very hard to tell whether google-chrome or firefox is correct with respect to the css specs here

16409327
versioning	upgrade
it s better in many ways but i wouldn t call it an upgrade versioning of latlontype since that wording suggests it is a derivative which totally false

updatepanel	contentplaceholder
i have a fb-like button on top of a masterpage and wrapped a updatepanel around the contentplaceholder

16409480
hide	show
i m sure you figured this out by now - but one approach that can sometimes be useful is to put the same logo twice in the html and show or hide the one you want depending upon the width

16409588
int	chars
if the int was used for the return type the chars wouldn t match the first argument

16409595
post	get
edit you can use the above link to to query geocoder to get the latitude and longitude for each address then use the above stackoverflow post to get and idea of how to calculate distant and then sort based on the list of doubles

especially before running commands like git pull or git push you should be committing your changes so that they do not get lost

16409797
free	malloc
first of all if you don t know the type of the data and all you know is that it s then you really should just be treating that data as a typeless blob of binary data and use malloc free to deal with it

put	get
the values that get put in your bound entity

16410158
min	max	range	max	range	min
range should be max - min and you can pre-calculate a multiplication factor dividing that by rand_max

16410180
range	minimum
assuming rand returns a floating point number 0 x 1 you simply need to scale by the range of your desired numbers and then add the minimum

16410180
min	max	range	max	range	min
your range is your max - min which is -10 - -100 90

16410213

chunked	transfer-encoding
the client can then read data off of the socket based on the transfer-encoding ie chunked and then decode it based on the content-encoding ie gzip

16410286
chunked	transfer-encoding
so in your case the client would send an accept-encoding gzip request header and then the server may decide to compress if not already and send a content-encoding gzip and optionally transfer-encoding chunked response header

16410286
chunked	transfer-encoding
and yes the transfer-encoding header can be used in requests but only for http 1.1 which requires that both client and server implementations support the chunked encoding in both directions

by not setting a specific size on the parent element it will get the size from its children and you don t get scrollbars

16414229
children	parent
as the children are now contained the floating elements will affect the size of the parent

16414229

if you decide to derive a new data structure for your own purposes i would wrap the underlying structure with a class implements only the methods you are likely to need rather than extends it - this is much less error prone and will restrict the number of methods you will have to override

16418272
getter	setter
spring ioc in simple answer normally you create object with new operatore and set yourself for getter and setter .so yes we use new operator in java to create object.there is no any bad in doing this.but when yours project size grows and lots of developer working and you want to achieve pojo based programming you can use di.so then may your question arises why i can not code it myself.of course you can using the power of reflection and annotation xml .but some other had already coded this than why not reuse .so you use third party .there are lost of option for you to choose .spring can be best one.so spring manages yours object life cycle from object creation to its destruction.you use the object created and set by spring di container but you do not create yourself

16418282

16418532
superclass	subclassing
in one of the assignments i had to override the superclass s getter method for the game logic so the method will get the subclassing of the game logic instead of the original one

16418532
getter	setter
my understanding is the new version of xcode does the synthesizing for me unless i override both its getter and setter

16418532
getter	setter
i did override the getter but not the setter so xcode technically should have included it automatically

16418558

16418594
getter	setter
the setter and getter get to control if and how you can access the fields

16418648
getter	setter
you can prevent write or read access to the field by only providing a getter or setter respectively -- but encapsulation with properties allows you to do more than just that

16418661
jtextfield	jlabel
so right now i d like to have a jtextfield where you can enter a date and the jlabel will update with the week number of that date

16418754
getter	setter
if you know you will always have 4 elements in your array and they have a different semantic coordinates x y z in a 3d space your second solution is probably better although giving public access to fields is not good practice and is no more performant as your compiler can inline bother trivial getter and setter

16418762
min	max
you can set min max values for xaxis but dynamic version can be achived by using variables defiend by user

16418764
getter	setter
if you have getter setter you can make a proxy of your class and do some aop or a make a 1.4 dynamic proxy

the reason it has to be setinterval is because the animation is so much snappier than when i use settimeout

put	get
if you have private fields they can t be accessed outside the class that means basically those fields don t exist to the outside world and yes you can change their value through setter methods but using setter methods you have more flexibility control to say who gets to change the fields and to what value can they be changed to...basically with encapsulation you get to put restrictions on how and who changes your fields

16420406
atomic	interlocked
if it is long ulong then it is not guaranteed to be atomic so you absolutely need some kind of protection such as via interlocked to avoid getting a torn value reading it half-way through being updated giving a phantom value that it never actually was - for example changing from 00000000 to ffffffff you could read 0000ffff or ffff0000

it s really a bit of a quirk i guess rather than anything else but i have designed a responsive site that resizes nicely in a browser when you resize the window and works perfectly when you load it up in either portrait or landscape on a mobile

16423327
portrait	landscape
however when you load it in portrait and then turn the mobile into landscape some mobile browsers don t load up the correct styling for the new screen size - but it doesn t happen like this for all browsers

in the oncreate method i filled the parameters to the edittext just width and height and called a method to display the alertdialog

16423802
serializable	deserialization
if you look at the code on google code you can see that mapreduce.model defines a json_defaults dict which determines the classes that get special-case handling in json serializable deserialization by default just datetime

16423802
serializable	deserialization
so you can monkey-patch the ndb.key class into there and provide it with functions to do that serializable deserialization - something like

16423834

here i used hsqldb which has a problem with a select without from but the same can be done even better with javadb derby pr h2sql

16424664
popupwindow	pop-up
instead of settouchinterceptor i have been using setonclicklistener or setontouchlistener which are not members of popupwindow true but i simply call a layoutinflater to get meeself the pop-up view and then set it as the popupwindow layout

16424675
viewdidload	viewwillappear
so when you create your uiviewcontroller in the viewdidload or viewwillappear or where is better for your application you should check if you have already the data to display if not display your loading ui i hope you are using some kind of cache and not requesting those data all the times

16424728
oncreate	findviewbyid
also oncreateview is called after oncreate so if you try to use findviewbyid in your oncreate it will return null since there is no layout view attached yet

post	put
you could do a separate query for the extra post you want and put them in a div with the css set to display none

16425367
width	height
as townsean pointed out you should probably create a style for your image where you can set common properties such as height width etc

16425386
width	height
my guess is that since you are adding the items to a stackpanel the stackpanel is choosing the default mins for height and width on the image which is probably 0 and that is why you are not seeing anything

16425386
width	height
try setting a value for the height and width of the image and see if anything shows

16425552
for-loop	loops
in some cases where you have code that uses parallel foreach loops to traverse few elements the actual cost of starting the threads in the background is actually much much more expensive than just iterating using a simple for-loop - so use it when there are many elements to iterate through

16425560
xslt	xquery
many serious users of xml would i suspect generalize your list of xslt s strengths in that spirit and prefer xslt or xquery whenever the input data are in xml

16425603

you may just be changing the reference of the this.albumpictureimage object while the visual tree the frameworkelement s with the parent children references retains the old reference

grouping has looser constraints than sorting so in theory it could be marginally faster than sorting but unless you re dealing with a lot of data you re unlikely to see a speed difference

16426897

16427393
instances	transient
the returned instances is transient - spring knows nothing about what you ve returned from getobject and will make no attempt to exercise any lifecycle hooks or anything else on it

16427397
hash	salt
the only way to do this is to hash the new password with the same algo cost and salt compare the resulting hash to the one currently in the db

16427470
int	double
we could be a slightly more flexible model by doing something like which would allow you define models that could hold int double float and long for example but i ll leave that to you

16427488
google-chrome	firefox
specifically firefox resubmits the post query that brought me to my current page whereas google-chrome does not

16427488
google-chrome	firefox
as a result firefox ends up where i started and google-chrome instead goes to the url in the address bar

16427499
hash	salt
however if you really need to find the salt of a bcrypt hash which is what password_hash uses then simply take the first 22 characters of the hash minus the settings but i will repeat however that you just need to compare input to hash

16427499
hash	salt
the functions don t return the salt because it s generated by a csprng and isn t needed at all for comparison as a separate parameter as it is part of the hash

16427506
folder	directory
you can approximate atomicity by moving the deleted files or directory to a trash folder and then only deleting the contents of the trash folder when everything else has succeeded and recover the data from the trash folder if anything goes wrong

16427510
int	chars
i m looking for a quick way to convert a large chars array of lowercase letters spaces and periods into a set of int and vice-versa in matlab

16427510
int	chars	int	double
usually i would use the double and chars functions but i would like to use a special set of int to represent each letter so that a matches with 1 b matches with 2 ..

16427532
subtract	add
then you can just add subtract pins from that

16427537
getter	setter
what kind of getter setter is created automatically for an arc environment on this case

16427578
post	get
even you add a hidden field and specify a parameter with same name in action method...tada you will get the value of hidden field in that variable on post back

16427618
jar	war
then from any standard war file you can just deploy this jar ill use the jar as a maven dependency

16427649
post	get
what is the reason of mixing get and post parameters

16427649
post	get
therefore it is not mixing get and post

16427650
notepad	textpad
create two blank new documents in notepad or textpad index.html and tm.htm and make sure it uses only 1252 or standard character encoding

16427658
post	get
one for get and second for post request

16427663
int	chars
you can also assume that it will really only get int and chars

16427676
getter	setter
you should probably just use synthesized getter and setter but if you aren t doing that just set the ivar and remove all the other code

16427787
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome works fine but on firefox gives me nan haven t test it on ie but i think it will be same result

16427816

16428257
vagrantfile	hosts
in my vagrantfile i ve done the following to forward the spork port to the mac hosts

16428291
put	get
for a non-interactive chart you can make one get for getting the image for the chart and then in your web page you can simply put an that points to that url

16428297
subtract	add
i crudely do this by making two calls to the db where first i call all the objects in question add them to an array and subtract from that array objects that match my requirements

16428334
for-loop	loops
i have got a for-loop but can t access variable from outside loops

16428341
uiview	uiwindow
normally you use 2 viewcontrollers and change between them but you can also use 2 different uiview on a uiwindow if you really wanted

16428370
strcpy	malloc
as far as i know this issue is due to a wrong format of variables passed into malloc strcpy and strcat functions

16428380
strcpy	malloc
to find out where these functions are defined you can read the man page by typing man malloc man strcpy or man strcat

16428389
inherited	properties
i have an inherited control mycontrol with a properties called myotherfont

16428389
inherited	properties
for example from the designer if i drag this control onto a form where the font is segoe ui it should inherited that value from the form and not show it as bolded in the properties window

16428396
dictionary	map
to explain the reasons of the behavior in the question i d like to clarify that objects in javascript are treated like a map dictionary or a key-value pair use the term what suits you best

16428478
google-chrome	firefox
firstly the code as posted actually works for me on google-chrome and firefox

16428486
folder	directory
and changing the ckan recipes to use the shared folder as the source directory as vitor pointed out

i was getting stdout stderr fatal could not parse object e0648dbf...

16428502
ubuntu	linux
now i m really a noob with ubuntu and linux generally

16428526
x86	64bit
for what is worth my machine is 64bit but the project is mean for and built as 32 bit x86

16428534
equals	gethashcode
also care needs to be taken so that the equals and gethashcode implementations satisfy the all-important condition that if two tuples compare equals they must have the same hash code

16428535
tolower	toupper
since the comparisons are going to be case-insensitive you could use the tolower toupper method in the string side when making the tuples and then always lower or upper the strings you ll have in the tuples used to retrive compare entries in the dictionary

16428544
post	put
i m not going to delete this post only because i feel like i should put my stupidity on display

you re adding the jscrollpane scroll to the jtabbedpane

16428569
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
google-chrome and opera plays sound correctly but firefox

16428592
ecdsa	rsa
rsa has much simpler math and can directly encrypt decrypt data you should never compare rsa and ecdsa

16428612
scatter	graphing
i have something similar in an app of mine the way i went about it was to add a bar graphing on top of the scatter plot i used that bar graphing to represent the line that tracks the user s touch

16428612
scatter	graphing
the bar graphing data source is only returning a value for the location the user is touching with a height to match the size of the scatter plot

16428615
getter	setter
here is a canonical example of a python class with a getter and a setter from wikipedia

16428621
width	height
the .page is being given a width and height from what i can only assume is in js but cannot find it anywhere

16428656
put	get	post	get	post	put
the problem is that if the http type post get put delete is different it will return 404

16428701
cos	sin
depending on your sin cos implementation you need to specify the angles in radians not degrees

16428731
tolower	toupper
the recommended solution is to either use the supported odata functions toupper or tolower to work out the case sensitivity issues when using a command and get the full result set

16428733
ontouch	ondraw
you can create a custom view.override it s ontouch method to change position of thumb.also override it s ondraw method and first draw red graph as background of your view and then the blue one from position that corresponds to the position of thumb

16428769
gif	png
metadata-extractor is a good product but does not support png or gif

16428799
getter	setter
your version simply replaced the name property defined with a getter with one defining only a setter the two having no relation otherwise

16428801
int	boolean
isinteger simply returns a boolean for whether the inputted values as a string is an int

16428819
getter	setter
getter and setter are kinda pointless in python unless they are actually doing things

16428823
onresume	onpause
since you are registering and unregistering in onpause and onresume you will get a lot of calls to onreceive

16428836
super	abstract
by the way i am deserializing the incoming bytes into the super abstract class packets is it also a problem or should i feel free to cast this into the derived packets

16428879
hide	show
i also added calls to move view when keyboard hide show is not triggered

16428918
width	height
mkmaprectmake ... seems to want width and height measured in map points

16428970
maven	pom.xml
then in your maven pom.xml just add your repositories as usual

16428987
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 26.0 mac google-chrome canary 28.0.1500.3 mac and ie9 don t exhibit this problem

16428992
post	get
it depends on what the user edits for example if he edits his own data you can do smth like the people above me have suggested or even more don t post get his id just do update data

16428995
width	height
width and height along with bitdepth and color model are not usually considered metadata rather they are basic image properties

16429005
width	margin
i set the width to the same as the fields and used an auto margin

16429005
opera	firefox
opera thinks it is a vector and firefox says it has errors

16429080
maven	m2e
installing m2e plugin enables importing maven projects directly from the import project wizard

16429225
tcpdf	fpdi
i have a form template i used fpdi and tcpdf to create a download link on the web application

16429227
min	max
so i have a java program that generates 100 random integers between 0 and 9 and i need to calculate the max min and average numbers of generated integers

16429283
for-loop	loops
it s printing out the same number of times the for-loop iterates because the statement is in loops

16429325
post	get
you are allowing multiple requests types get and post to access this route

16429359
put	get
if i put .pdf at the end of the url i get this

16429392
selecteditem	selectedindex
i tried again with selectedindex instead of selecteditem

16429393
selecteditem	selectedindex
forget selecteditem and selectedindex

16429422
onresume	onpause
my solution was a result of them all by switching to a manifest declared receiver and enabling disabling the receiver component in onresume onpause stopped the sticky nature of the receiver

16429489
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome but doesn t seem to be working in firefox or ie

16429502
folder	directory
my var www folder consists of two directory

16429528
google-chrome	firefox
edit actually for firefox or google-chrome it only works if yourwindownamehere is whatever the page you are on is for example this page is python - how do i programmatically ...

16429531
onresume	onpause
you should override onpause and onresume methods of your activity

16429624
folder	directory
in the folder directory there is no index.html file but only the .htaccess file

16429678
distance	polygons
distance point to polyline or polygons

16429687
versioning	upgrade
i have authored the msis in such a way that the pro versioning will upgrade and replace the lite versioning

16429687
versioning	upgrade
but once i ve wrapped them in burn the pro versioning upgrade the msi correctly but the lite install entry remains in the arp list

16429724
printf	atoi
without any functions like atoi or printf

16429747
vaadin	gxt
yes indeed vaadin and gxt provide a default nicer look and feel.

16429755
getter	setter
i m guessing that in addition to your explicit setter method you also wrote your own explicit getter method for the myview property

16429755
getter	setter
when you provide both of the setter and getter methods for a property the compiler does not automatically generate an ivar for you

16429755
getter	setter
with that you can reference the _myview ivar in your setter and getter methods

16429766
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
and nullpointerexception with a message is more specific than say illegalargumentexception and there s lots of precedents in the java standard class libraries for constructors etc that are documented as throwing nullpointerexception

16429785
put	get	post	get	post	put
i have a problem with rest json service.i have problems with all rest operations post put delete get

16429813
getter	setter
the synthesize command creates getter and setter methods linked to the _myview instance variable

16429813
getter	setter
this also allows you to implement a custom setter without having to implement the getter method

16429837
spaces	delimiter
prepare spaces for your procedure and set the delimiter

16429967
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
while it works exactly the way on want it in firefox i can figure out why it behaves differently in google-chrome and safari gets into fixed position as soon as you scroll down just a little bit

16429970
getter	setter
also i know that i could have generated getter and setter but i tend to not do that for simple domain objects

16430059
versioning	upgrade
easy make the pro bundle have a higher versioning than the lite bundle - upgrade only kick in when the versioning is higher

16430100
post	get
apologies for the poor quality of the data in the post first time posting and i couldn t get it to work

16430116
stdout	stderr
in which case you would be sending the output to the standard error output device for the application which may or may not be the same as stdout -- as with stdout stderr is a pointer to a file stream representing the default output device for error messages

16430158
put	get
i also don t get any values put into it when making inserts

16430178
width	height
however if you set the image to width 100 so that it becomes responsive the height scales up and down with the width of the browser so the margin-top technique doesn t work

16430191
width	margin
another option is not to float the main content column but instead assuming it s the right column to give it a large left margin that is slightly wider than the width of the left column

16430240
put	get
i can do that manually before calling put but if the method fails then the put doesn t get called either

16430275
profiling	debugging
click on your project and your target and then individually check the provisioning profiling for each code signing identity ad hoc debugging release etc. by actually clicking on it

16430344
inline	inlining
by implementing the basic list functions to use church encodings internally inlining their definitions aggressively and applying this rule to the inline code nested uses of functions like map can be fused into a tight loop

16430379
google-chrome	firefox
when i try to access this url in google-chrome firefox or the command line i keep getting this error

16430389
post	get
i can t get it to post with the postbackurl attribute set or with the onclick this never fires

16430446
inherited	subclassing
i often have a problem deciding whether declaring something as an instance or as an is-a inherited and declaring an instance of subclassing is suitable

16430498
for-loop	loops
if you just want to iterate use a for-each loops or directly a for-loop with an iterator

16430504
matlabpool	parfor
now by rewriting the loops you could use parfor after opening a matlabpool

16430505
hide	show
i m using this jquery code to hide the main div and show the div corresponding to the link clicked

16430505
hide	show
when i click on the info link for example the home div hide and the info div is show but the page scrolls down due to the

16430514
int	double
i found that our clients read all values int double etc. from the mysql c-connector in ascii literals

16430514
int	double
all of our data in this application consists of numerical values int and double so i am wondering

16430516
superclass	subclassing
b if you specify that basestation values cannot change then you not only cannot use two instances of the same class for that usage but you cannot even extend basestation to get your dynamicbasestation as the subclassing would violate the superclass contract

16430554
folder	directory
and copy each one to the . node_modules directory inside your node.js application folder

16430610
fseek	fread
first thing you need to do is check the return values from fopen fwrite fread fseek etc

16430610
fseek	fread
you then fseek to 512 ending up at eof at 80 and try to fread 40 bytes

16430628
bash	zsh
i noticed a while ago already that in zsh you can get a by typing like in bash

16430730
lodash	underscore.js
however the underscore.js library or the comparable lodash library does have such a method isequal and it can handle a variety of other cases like object literals as well

16430753
hide	show
i am trying to create a button that show hide a div

16430753
hide	show
whenever this button link is clicked i want it to show hide the messages div

16430759
uicollectionview	uitableview
another benefit of core data is that it works seamlessly with uitableview and uicollectionview to intelligently search and load only relevant items within your data set which helps improve overall app performance

16430800
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
displays perfectly in google-chrome safari and firefox

16430838
int	chars
first get all of the non-numeric chars out of your string and convert it to an int

16430844
put	get
please note i can t simply put the code and maps function between script tags in a html.erb file because i m using some ajax and things get messed up - the ruby variables need to be recognised by the js file

16430857
int	chars
i have a txt file with 500 data and every one of them consists of int and strings max 15 chars

16430888
getter	setter
since you have getter and setter for the name and address fields they can both serve as properties

16430929
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
you can change the width height and margin property of section for different results

16430958
typedef	struct
won t work because in this case ptr and c_ptr are very simple struct that do nothing except make 3 typedef so they don t convert

16431007
google-chrome	firefox
this is the normal behavior of google-chrome it seems and firefox has the option to do this as well

16431007
google-chrome	firefox
i need to reproduce this exact behavior but something is going wrong somewhere in between the manual instance of google-chrome firefox and the one controlled by watir

16431009
pandas	pytables
edit given that your file is very large and i don t know your environment and you re having trouble with pandas consider giving pytables a try

16431022
getter	setter
this avoids having to write 5-20 different getter setter for different kinds of skill

16431064
int	double
you would then split this wherever you find white space and store 1 as an int lunch and box as strings and 3.99 as a double using double for monies is not recommended

16431067
int	chars
each element of the hs list is itself a tuple of the form int chars int int -- 3 - 4 -1 and denotes the operation

16431079
yacc	bison
the yacc bison family - parse yapp or parse eyapp

16431081
inherited	properties
it inherited the bulk of its properties from clplacemark part of the core location framework

16431090
equals	gethashcode
you have to provide an override for gethashcode as well as equals

16431118
equals	gethashcode
you also need to override the gethashcode method so that two cells that are equals return the same hash code

16431142
for-loop	loops
only to write the outer loops as a traditional for-loop

16431207
web2py	cherrypy
soon i abandoned web2py and proceeded with cherrypy as it is fairly straightforward

16431207
web2py	cherrypy
so whatever i ve done using cherrypy may be possible to transfer over to web2py

16431207
web2py	cherrypy
i hope to find out more about fellow users experiences in using web2py and cherrypy

16431223
uilabel	uifont
for example if you want the text in a uilabel to be bold you would do something like label.font uifont boldsystemfontofsize 12.0f

16431238
post	get
so in short nowadays there is no reason to mix get and post

16431242
rss	feed
i am trying to load these rss feed from the ny times

16431264
mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	wav	aiff
afplay some.mp3 - can play any audio what can play quicktime so mp3 wav aiff etc.

16431275
post	get
ref post statuses update . therefore your app must get the user s authorization an oauth access token in order to send a tweet

16431333
children	parent
parent children and children s children

16431333
children	parent
what i want to accomplish the motive is not relevant is that that child gets a relative width depending on the parent s width a percentage and the children s children must have an overflow ellipsis depending on that width

16431338
button	checkbox
but this xml file works at least for all field but for my custom validator the radio button and the checkbox list

16431342
websphere	ibm
ibm also does websphere which has a udp component

16431346
width	height
php get all the images from url which width and height 200 more quicker

16431384
pull	push
restrict write access to the old repository s central push pull location

16431458
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior doesn t exist on google-chrome firefox

16431523
post	get
and have a look at this blog post i wrote that will get you started with google map api v2 implementation in your app

16431568
button	checkbox
add another control to your input form an invisible checkbox near the submit button

16431568
button	checkbox
once you detect that record is duplicate interrupt the validation and make checkbox visible but submit button - disabled

16431568
button	checkbox
when user checks the checkbox submit button should become visible again

16431569
folder	directory
make sure you find all the dlls - the bin folder too obviously and remember that the dlls are executed from a shadow directory

16431577
width	height
for the initial image not showing you may be needing a width and height on the div if there is no content within the div

16431580
width	height
you ll have to play with height and width but i ve tried it here and it seems to work ok

16431612
mouse	keyboard
if add in vimrc then the user can use the mouse but i wonder what can it do while how great keyboard shortcuts is

16431620
istream	getline
one simplification could be since getline returns an istream to test it directly in the while condition

16431632
vbo	vao
do the same thing for other vao and vbo

16431674
mdpi	hdpi
i m trying to support mdpi hdpi and xhdpi on my current app

16431674
screens	hdpi
so my problem is that on an hdpi phone atrix 2 the image takes about 1 3 of the screens which is perfect for me

16431674
mdpi	hdpi
what s the best way to set a height for an imageview from the web not resources to support mdpi and hdpi

16431674
mdpi	hdpi	screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi
basically my problem is that the 200dp takes different of screens on mdpi and hdpi

16431721
versioning	upgrade
i am running xcode 4.4.1 can t upgrade with phone gap versioning 2.7

16431738
screens	hdpi
since the atrix is hdpi and hdpi is a 1.5 multiplier 200dp will take up 300px in real pixels or approximately 1 3 300 960 of the screens as you point out

16431738
screens	mdpi
on the mdpi ace the 200dp translates evenly to 200px which should be closer to 1 2 the screens

16431742
firefox	safari
i tested on safari 6.0.4 and firefox 20.0 on mac osx 10.7.5

the reason why getinternetconnectionprofile was returning a null ref was due to the fact that when on a laptop if you disconnect from a wireless connection the laptop s internet connection profile defaults to ethernet whereas the tablet at least the samsung 700t doesn t have an ethernet port so it s connection profile doesn t exist if a wireless connection isn t established

16442259
lxml	elementtree
beyond that i would totally suggest you use elementtree preferably lxml s elementtree

16442259
lxml	elementtree
also lxml s elementtree parser takes a file-like object which can be a urllib object

16442275
width	height
the problem here is that an un-styled div has width 100 and no height

16442275

16442454

this problem is linked to the fact that xamarin and mono don t yet properly support portable class libraries - instead they compile and link against local fixed assemblies depending on what version of mono xamarin.android xamarin.ios etc you have loaded - see for some more information

16442492
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
in all other browsers i ve tested firefox google-chrome safari no such click event is generated on the document and the menu remains displayed as desired

16442503
post	get
separate instances of the form object will be instantiated for the get and post requests so you can t save the old_name to self

the easyish way to do this is to create a hidden form field that the user doesn t see but will get submitted by the post request

16442504
udp	tcp
udp will almost always provide better performance than tcp at the cost of reliability

16442574
sorting	filtering
quicksand seems to offer filtering pretty well but the sorting function seems to be lacking a bit

16442626
width	margin
the 16px more width come from the fact as you pointed out yourself that the body has a default margin of 8px

16442693
tolower	toupper
for this you can use toupper or tolower

16442723

16442914
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
if you need the fixed element to be 100 width and you still want space you can consider using box-sizing border-box

16442914
width	border-box
margins and borders and padding are always added to the dimensions of an element unless you use the border-box model in which case width will include padding and borders

16443015
pull	push
then you can add it as a remote and push and pull changes to and from it on both machines

16443652

16443705

next best is a vb6 dll but this is now a dead technology and won t work in 64-bit excel next best is obfuscated .net but you really need to be using the kind of .net xll interface provided by add-in express or xl dna to avoid the poor performance characteristics of .net interop and vsto

16444887
google-chrome	firefox
i was hoping to analyse these by using source maps to link errors in the minified source back to the original code but it seems google-chrome and firefox only provide line numbers on error

16444902

versioning	upgrade
jpfuentes2 s solution above should do the trick it s very similar to the pull request below but i m hesitant to apply anything that s patching rails internals as it could be a real pain to upgrade between major versioning especially if you don t have tests for it and let s face it developers often skimp on controller tests

my original thoughts was to turn the string into a char arrays then make a for-loop where i try integer.parseint character.tostring char arrays element and if it threw a numberformatexception it would continue the for-loop

16452169
portrait	landscape
then did an override of the view controllers -viewwilllayoutsubviews method to manually set the bounds of the superview to match the screen size 768x1004 for portrait and 1024x748 for landscape

16452176

you could get rid of some of the cost of converting to an int by simply checking if the chars is a digit and if it is adding the appropriate amount but since this code already works i ll leave that up to you

16452178
post	get
finally a simple way is to use get instead of post so you can easily call your script with parameters directly in the browser and see results

google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie

16452256
post	get
if you use _request ininstead of _get or post it will pull it from the first one it finds in either post get cookie and session variables

16452766
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works in firefox but not ie or google-chrome

16452788
typedef	struct
the reason for the typedef struct stacknode stacknode is usually to avoid having to write struct whenever using it

16452853
spaces	linefeed
however for the linefeed to work you need to set white-space pre to preserve the white spaces in the pseudo-element

16452865
google-chrome	firefox
it s working for me in firefox and google-chrome and ie

16452865

children	parent
then you just go up or down from there using parent or children to do something to either of those

16453034
aggregate-functions	sum
null values won t break your calculation because the aggregate-functions sum ignores those

16453059
uiwebview	nsurlprotocol
it seems like i ought to be able to trigger handling for these failures with an nsurlprotocol subclass but in initwithrequest cachedresponse client i can t find a way of determining which uiwebview fired off the request so that i can notify its delegate to display something to the user

16453067
try-catch	exception-handling
should i have a try-catch block in b and c that catches myuserdefinedexception as raises a new exception-handling specific to that method or is there a clean way of inspecting the trace

16453247
google-chrome	safari
when i look in safari and google-chrome the size of the pop-up window is good and consistent

16453248
getter	setter
a getter or a setter will do

16453256
cublas	cufft	cublas	npp	npp	cufft
and by the way for cuda s error you have to specify whether it s an npp ncv cufft or cublas error

16453262
for-loop	arrays
also after creating the arrays how do i add the rectangles on the window probably a for-loop

16453302
stdout	stderr
more specifically i use a streamhandler to log messages to stdout stderr and use supervisord to log those messages to files since the server process is monitored by supervisord

16453319

i have set chgrp -r staff repo.git as well as chmod -r 660 repo.git

16453349
comparator	comparable

16453360
button	checkbox
my question is that if i checked the checkbox in each sub items and press a menu button how is it possible to get the ids of each selected sub items in avariable

in addition to the client-side jquery widget apparently your server-side code relies on an acticvex control that needs to be registered on your server done via its installation package or regsvr32 command

16453429
entities	entitymanager
i believe we are releasing all references to the manager but chrome s take heap snapshot tool doesn t show the entitymanager or any entities being deleted when we leave our view

16453527
width	height
the best way is to let system handle the width and height a call to super should give you the correct width and height which will display the full text contents

16453527
width	height
although if you want explicitly setting the width to 100 and height to 25 setpreferredsize is one way

16453543
quicksort	mergesort
typically the fastest sort is quicksort or mergesort which benefits from random access therefore arrays

16453554
accessor	properties
you have to define get accessor for the properties of class1 because they are all unreachable from outside the class and class2 needs to use their values

16453554
accessor	properties
defining public properties with get accessor can be useful

16453564
children	parent
seems a simple solution would be to create a simple class with a sorted std vector or std multimap to track its children and a pointer to its parent

16453590
setinterval	settimeout
is only needed when you re outside of the context of angular like a settimeout setinterval or non-angular xhr callback

16453592
keydown	keyup
and for that i think you ll need to trap and record keyup and keydown

16453632
folder	directory
i created a .htaccess folder in the wp-admin directory with the following code

16453639
ssl	https
i m a new in android development recently i just get into android area now i encountered a problem when i tried to access server application with https request like we use spring for android to handle request and use apache http server + tomcat + ssl as a deployment environment

16453639
ssl	https
when i use http request instead of https request and remove ssl from the deployement environment the access can be successfully handled

16453650
innodb	myisam
the answer states the following if you have innodb but not myisam

16453679
post	get
this system does not provide any service interface so the app uses a webrequest to both get and post requests to system 1

16453685
disk	ram
flat files are as fast the storage medium being used disk or ram

16453685
disk	ram
theory 1 - you know your limitation is ram - spool dynamic content to disk when feasible and drop such features as hit counters

16453685
disk	ram	apache	nginx
leverage nginx or highly tune apache or as we did wrote our own web servers since 2001 - the whole concept is leverage ram for the most used and have a very intelligent lookup for disk based content - normally the uri is fine

16453685
disk	ram
if you want to beat memcached performance learn how to setup a ram disk and keep your deflated hot requested items there

16453732
for-loop	loops
within this for-loop you are going to set the iteration counter equal to your outside loops iteration counter

16453793
width	height
this setting confuses jcrop when obtaining the width and height of the image

16453825
hide	show

16453856
punctuation	words
noise - as referenced in the jw post and my answer strip out crap punctuation stop words etc for matching purposes

16453868
division	multiplication
you can parse linearly along operators with the same precedence so the algorithm can iterate looking for multiplication or division to recurse on recursing on the first one found

16453868
subtraction	addition
if none is found it can do the same for addition and subtraction and finally if none is found just return the number as the base case interestingly the latter example i gave has 2 base case instances 2 and 4

16453890
min	max
call every interval min max

16453890
min	max
2 check to see if any max is greater than the next entry over s min

16453890
min	max
1 since your list of intervals is known to be in a state where it is sorted by min and also sorted by max binary search into it to find the lowest min just above your new min and the highest max just above your new max

16453890
min	max
2 iterate over min max min max.

16453890
min	max
etc in your array that are between your new min and new max

16453890
min	max
below the lowest min above the highest max and between each max min you can compute the interval that is in the gap there and return them in an array

16453890
min	max
1 we binary search into our list and find that 13 is the lowest min above 1 and 24 is the highest max above 30

16453890
min	max
between max and the next min is 16 and 21 - so this forms an interval 17 20 exclusive on both ends

16453892
post	get
hi i have a connect middleware which uses the connect router to handle request for methods like get post etc.i want to throw error if a person chooses methods other than these two.i do not have scope for the request object inside the router function.below is my code

16454039
post	put
you should change your method of link from post to put and

16454095
post	get
it s going to be tough not having any code but to answer your question you have 4 choices get post session and cookies

16454095
post	get
i would seriously talk to your boss about using get and post variables because if your trying to keep it secure then passing a post get variable is very insecure and can be altered in between steps

16454099
client-side	server-side
instead of doing the variable replacing client-side since i was doing it in a rails app anyway i moved it server-side

move	drag
i have some widgets inside a qscrollarea and i m dragging between these widgets the problem is that the qscrollarea doesn t scroll when i m dragging inside it so if i want to drag between a widget a to the widget b and the widget b is not visible on the viewport the qscrollarea doesn t automatically scroll when the mouse move to the edge of the viewport

16468068

i m uncertain if this will block nrvo return-value-optimization but there isn t a fundamental reason why it should and moving a std vector is cheap enough that you probably won t care if it does block nrvo return-value-optimization anyhow

16468231
free	malloc
calling free doesn t destroy the allocated memory it merely makes it available for allocation by future calls to malloc

16468233

i think that these are the rows and columns because cvsize has parameters for width and height

16468285

as far as the height go modern device browsers will set it proportionally to the width that is determined

16468328
width	height
the keyboard size returned from the notification had the height and width of the keyboard reversed

16468391

16468566
int	double
trans and rots are simply array of double and int you simply use to print the i-th element

16468594

instead of using segues you can simply create different cells with different identifiers and show or hide them based on what services are detected in your services array which is populated from your web service

16468599
shim	polyfills
here is another possibility it is using array.foreach so you need to have a modern browser or use one of the many shim polyfills out there

16468626
keydown	keyup
at its simplest you ll need to listen to the keypress event or keyup or keydown events and if a particular key is used respond to that event

16468733
hide	show

one approach you could take is to use a fake timer in your testing suite like sinon which works with mocha or qunit

16469055
google-chrome	firefox
if you re going to send it in html5 i see no reason to build a browser though there are already many browsers that have more people working on them you d be hard pressed to beat something like firefox or google-chrome unless you have a specific feature you want and then a plugin might be better

16475918
int	chars
let s forget for a moment that the copied file is corrupt to begin with and focus on the size.why is it that the size is so small if we copy chars by chars or byte by byte but is big original size when we copy int by int or 4-bytes by 4-bytes

it is not uncommon for division to take some tens of processor cycles in comparison to a single cycle for addition and multiplication

16483246
width	height
the easiest way to avoid this expense may be to make width and height compile-time constants that are powers of two

16483246
width	height
this allows the compiler to change the remainder operations using width or height to fast bit-mask operations

16483322
factors	mean
i mean in many cases like in approximation algorithms or randomized algorithms or algorithms like sssp as above when we iterate over something subproblems possible solutions ... we choose number of iteration corresponding to the trade of that we have time space complexity of algorithm constant factors of the algorithm ...

inherited	properties
i m having difficulty ignoring a properties on an class which inherited from a base class

16484471

in the cases when you create a resource on the server you have to use put or post and in the cases when you want the read some resource from the server you re supposed to use get

16484634
post	get
similar questions have been asked about the nature of when to use post and when to use get in an ajax request

16484634

if i open any aspx file from one of these sub folder the page directive says it is looking for a web.config file in that directory instead of the root of the project

16485020
min	max
instead of saving min or max value with each element we can use two stacks

16485020
minimum	max	min	max
because change in the minimum or maximum value will not be so frequent we push the min or max value to its respective stack only when the new value is or to the current min or max value

16485030

i ve recently been looking at durandal and i think it finally provides a very viable solution to creating spas i specially like how unlike sammy.js you don t have to load all views on the initial page load even if the user isn t going to visit those pages

16485444
elasticsearch	kibana
i am using logstash - grok and elasticsearch and my main aim is to first accept the logs by logstash parse them by grok and associate tags with the messages depending on the type of the log and then finally feed it to the elastic server to query with kibana

it s especially frustrating since it only appears to affect android devices - it works perfectly fine with windows google-chrome safari firefox ie mac and iphone

16485489
getter	setter
it will add getter and setter automagically as long as your classes are correctly annotated

16485510
put	get
the client of this method would not get expected content from that file - he can handle runtime exception otherwise i should first check checked exception put a message to log then throw exception up out form the method

16486045
apache-poi	docx4j
a lot of what docx4j does is automated where areas apache s apache-poi you have to do a lot of manual coding for docx support

punctuation	words
basically it s meant to translate words to a different language while maintaining the same punctuation and spaces

16486135
punctuation	words
linetotranslate is an input argument which is an array of words spaces and punctuation

16486207
superclass	subclassing
you must implement the myinterface in subclassing too and can override the setprogress method of myinterface and not of its superclass

16486210
filtering	grouping
well yes you are usually right filtering client side generally force the server to returns everything then things will be filtering ordered client side but one of the main goal of wcf ria services is indeed to make possible to define filtering ordering and even grouping on client side then execute them on server side

16486241

factors	matrix
anyway just as in regression with dummy variables one of the levels of the factors cannot be included because it is linearly dependent on the dummy variables for the remaining levels in the model matrix

notice that there are three variables in the model matrix but there are four levels in the management factors

16486506

the reason this function won t work particularly well when working in text mode is that ftell isn t guaranteed to useful for anything other than fseek ing back to that location hence the code isn t particularly suitable when working with files open in text mode

google-chrome	firefox
if you think about w3c s specs on web-based technologies you may remember that many of them deppend on adoption of the browsers since unlike the examples of java and php where the language resources are developped with the guidance of an enterprise or a group html5 can only be implemented today in a signicative way by the major browser manteiners like for instance mozzila foundation for firefox and google inc with google-chrome

16486666

filesystems	fat
a fat filesystems saves all files as one basic size unless the file is larger than that size then it re adapts the size to hold the entire file

16486672
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
but the point here is that a fat filesystems is mainly good if you have allot of disk space other wise i would recommend using an ntfs filesystems if possible

in order for a type to be used as a dictionary key either its equals and gethashcode methods must have the desired semantics or else the constructor of the dictionary must be given an which implements the desired semantics

equals	gethashcode
the default equals and gethashcode method for classes will key on object identity useful if one wishes to key upon the identities of mutable objects

16486759

note i am happy if this works in google-chrome and firefox

16486977
put	get	post	get	post	put
however i was under the impression that any get or post parameters team and institution would be mapped to the parameters of the receiving method which is why i put team in the form objectroutevalues while i expect the institution to be supplied by the select box value

post	get
now the problem i am having is that some of my team members feel that what we are doing is messy and frictional because it kind of a pain how to get my applications to display a users name next to their post which is a very common task

16487216
post	get
i personally don t mind the way we are doing it as i think it s important to just use a single separate user database for data constancy but some of my team members want to copy over all of the user names into the local application databases and store the user name next to the userid when recording post so its super simple to get that information back out

16487252
getter	setter
there are many many good reason to always use getter and often use setter in java and it s still a great practice to adhere to even when writing code for droid

16487252
getter	setter
while naively there is a higher cost with dalvik using virtual methods getter setter rather than instance field access - you can avoid this by using proguard to inline these calls at build time

filesystems	fat
a fat filesystems saves files into clusters by 16 bytes or 32 bytes explaining the label of fat16 fat32 and basically wasting disk space

16487504
disk	ram
ntfs however is a little more dynamic than that files can be saved as their own size but again the ram causes the files to be saved randomly on to disk therefor to clean up these empty spaces it is best to run disk defrag a default program on all versions of windows

16487583
implements	extends
i am extends countdown timer class and have implements timer but i have a problem here i have set timer to 60 seconds now i will lock the screen by clicking on device power button so i guess the timer should automatically pause but i see that the timer is pausing after 5 more seconds moving

another way of doing it you can set each of above images as a back-ground image each for a different class wit ha numerical value and you change the div class by making use of toggleclass jquery property like in this example - check the page source -

16487834
switching	screens
when looking at the examples for the sliding menu library i got the idea that it might be the best approach as it used switching fragments but i still think that an activity is better for a screens than a fragment

you may consider learning about wakelock and alarmmanager

16487925
getter	setter
i was using xmltransient on the class and needed to instead use an xmlanyelement annotation on the setpayload t payload method though i suspect it doesn t matter which method of the setter getter pair is annotated as long as only one has the annotation

i have a webservice running and ready to consume images produced by my android tablet camera samsumg galaxy tab 10.1

16488025
hide	show
my solution was create two select and use show and hide jquery method

16488060

so there are two methods a page that is actually a facebook tab may be requested get and post

16488169
width	text-align
not sure if you tried this or if it will work for you i m new to coding but try floating your sidebar left float content right both text-align to left and use percentages for width

16488172
int	boolean
i write a class in java called rangeset which uses the data structure of an array of boolean to represent a set of int using 3 methods

16488172
int	boolean
basically here it is a set of int limited to a range 1 to n implemented by an array of boolean

16488184
width	height
also the width and height specified for element is not working

16488195
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
this page has a lot of documentation on how jqxhr jquery xmlhttprequest differs from xmlhttprequest xmlhttprequest

16488209
getter	setter
i don t think code in getter setter are out of style

16488209
getter	setter
i would recommend code in getter and setter as long as they are

16488209
getter	setter
i have also sometimes used virtual getter and setter for some classes to be able to modify certain kinds of behavior

16488255
ember.js	backbone.js
on a side note if one is starting with a large scale javascript application at present using angular.js may be more suited than knockout.js if you prefer declarative approach dom attribute based data-binding and mvvm pattern and ember.js may be more suited than backbone.js if you prefer mvc and string based handlebars templates

many-to-many	many-to-one
where there is a many-to-many relationship between two relational tables as described here - one objective can be set for many classes and each class can have many objectives this should normally represented by a link table which will have a many-to-one relationship with each of the parent tables

16488286
int	boolean
as you ve got int from you need n boolean values which will be true if the element of value n has already been inserted

16488302
glfw	glew
i have a very simple shader with a single uniform vec4 running in a program using glew and glfw

16488327
min	max
i ve recently started using jboss 6.1.0 and ran into an issue with setting min and max pool size in oracle-ds.xml file

16488327
min	max
i tried two approaches for both max and min pool size

16488327
min	max
when max and min pool sizes were set as configurable variables the datasource object created had max-pool-size 0 and min-pool-size 0

16488329
gruntjs	package.json
my issue is that gruntjs s convention is to use package.json to define dependencies library versions dependencies etc

16488348
google-chrome	safari
i have created a pure css menu and it works great in all browsers except google-chrome and safari

16488348
google-chrome	safari
it works fine on all browsers except google-chrome and safari and when i set it to white-space nowrap

16488350
hide	show
make that as the left most column hide it and lock it do users can t show that column or change it s contents

16488441
hash	salt
you could also do this via a hidden input value or other method but this was the simplest way. then i had to add the formdata option to my uploadify call along with some php code that gets the timestamp and hash it with a unique salt which you should change to a random string

16488465
width	height
a blank placeholder that caused the div to get a height and width then be able to be re-sized on the container re-size

16488473
width	height
top panel with full width and 20 height and side panel with rest of the height and 20 width

16488478

how to show hide divs in response to a hover event css and or javascript

16488497
tail	nohup
i can launch it using nohup and pass in arguments like what file it is to parse it uses a platform independent tail class i wrote in python

16488502
hash	salt
you could also do this via a hidden input value or other method but this was the simplest way. then i had to add the formdata option to my uploadify call along with some php code that gets the timestamp and hash it with a unique salt which you should change to a random string

16488615
put	get
of course you can put other numbers to get your desired color

16488618
inherited	properties
in the case of your binding normally the datacontext would be inherited so the visibility binding could find the properties mycontrolvisible on the current datacontext however because you hardcoded the datacontext in your usercontrol s constructor that properties is not found

16488630
next	except
this would actually be fine except it also seems to freeze my file iterator at the next line s v

16488636
folder	directory
same for the zend_loader there is a directory of zend http client but client is also a folder

16488649
hide	show
now your edit button will be placed inside master view then you can easily show hide the elements like this

16488742
screens	tablet
on a tablet you could just use two fragments and display the content on one screens without launching a new one while you could chose to display only one fragment on a handset device you can do all this by using dynamic and static fragments and by making use of the layout-sw600 etc

16488742
screens	tablet
you will maintain a good user flow and make use of the screens estate of a tablet if you decide to do this

16488745
sysv	systemd
if you are using sysv systemd not upstart you can put the process do respawn at inittab

16488758
uilabel	uibutton
you don t need to add a uilabel to the uibutton

16488886
width	height
the first subnav animates height the second one should animate width only

16488886
width	height
now the issue with the above code is that when hovering over the michael nav label the width and the height animates

16488937
post	get
i noticed you seemed to solve this with a get request but i noticed two immediate problems with your post request

16488947
int	boolean
i have an instance class called review that takes in string string int string boolean

16488947
getter	setter
this is the basic class w constructor they all have their own getter setter

16488995
min	max
the trouble i have is that always the printed max and min are zero and i really don t know how to solve the problem

16489006
hide	show
i have a window with many fields some of these fields show hide other fields or elements in the view

16489006
width	height
that function basically gets the body width and height and resizes the window accordingly using window.resizeto function

16489086
textview	imageview
i then need to crop the picture so that the picture is only of an imageview and the textview that is on top of it

16489129
width	height
something i have done a few times is take the data and turn it into a percentage then make an images height or width that percent

16489129
width	height
simply set the image height width to the appropriate day percentage and then you have yourself a nice little bar graph with accurate within a pixel lines

16489151
implements	extends
finally preferring to implements an interface rather than extends a class is a good practice

16489240
put	get
i need to if first field starts by total then put zero in third field so i can get

16489274
getter	setter
but i would consider using getter and setter instead it s considered better practice

16489284
post	get
there are two concern to get maximum x and y of device which one you need i don t know but here i post both

16489284
width	height
you can use following code to get maximum height and width of device

16489287
qgroupbox	qvboxlayout
i have a simple window which i would like to display a button and a label horizontally in a qhboxlayout then a qgroupbox with some qradiobutton displayed vertically in a qvboxlayout

16489303
children	parent
i was dabbling with getting excessive with parameters to give complete type safety in a system where i had a concept of parent and children objects

16489303
children	parent
assuming i did keep all of this the main weakness is that it allows only one type of parent for child and one type of child per parent sometimes it makes sense for a parent to have two children

16489313
width	height
you can set html body table with css width and height

16489327
int	double
according to java the string 1.0 cannot be represented as an int but it can be represented a double

16489327
int	double
if you must accept a string such as 1.0 and store the resulting int then i would parse it as double then call intvalue

16489358
google-chrome	firefox
i have the menu working correct on ie with z-indexs but can t get the same results with google-chrome and firefox

16489363
width	margin
the total width is calculated with the width of the elements plus the width of the margin space

16489363
width	margin
if you want to remove the margin space that s fine but to avoid that gap you mentioned you also need to increase the width of the columns

16489363
width	margin
in this case you need to increase the width of a single column by its removed margin space which would be 30px

16489363
width	margin
so let s say your columns width is 50px normally with 30px margin space

16489363
width	margin
remove the margin space and make the width 80px

16489404
onresume	onpause
the task of onpause method is to stop the music and sound and onresume method is to again play sound and music

16489451
int	chars
trying to place either an int or a string into an 2d chars array but i m having no luck

16489469
width	height
during initialization i store a left top width and height ratio

16489478
versioning	upgrade
wix installer alone works fine but when i try to upgrade my old versioning i get two application installed

16489486
free	malloc
when i implemented my own version of malloc in college i used two linked lists a free list and an allocated-buffers list interspersed with calls to sbrk when i ran out

16489486
free	malloc
but now i have real-world issue our software malloc s buffers and puts them on linked lists where they may get free hours later by code in one function or another

16489486
free	malloc
but very little code has the free in the same function as the malloc

16489486
free	malloc
this occasionally leads to a malloc ed buffer being free twice

16489497
width	height
the width and height of the img are taken from internal style sheet i.e one defined in the head tag

16489531
width	height
values of width and height should be numbers or and are attributes inline style would be

16489535
width	height
width and height in your img element are html attributes

16489564
put	get
that way the score is influenced by the weights that you put on the query and if you sort by score default you get the results in the expected order

16489598
daemons	launchd
so obvious thing to do is to prevent this daemons from launchd automatically

16489598
daemons	launchd
then your application can ask for a password and when it s entered correctly you can launchd afc daemons back like this

16489604
min	max
it sounds like you would need two opencl kernels one for calculating the min and max and the other to actually scale the data

16489610
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
example page works pretty much as desired in firefox google-chrome but not in safari

16489620
int	chars
try casting chars on the int you have

16489667
domparser	saxparser
i know there is domparser and saxparser for java but am wondering if other languages or other means to easily get this information is now available in this day and age now that were in 2013 to simplify this

16489689
srt	subtitle
i have subtitle in srt format

16489704
hide	show
i simply added hide to the password fields and then made the script show them once the email was valid

16489705
width	height
the problem with the rectangle collision is i have a little image that has a hitbox and i have it so you can draw a selection box with your mouse but the two only collide if the selection box has a positive height and width

16489705
post	get
i ll post the code below and as for the speed problem i don t know how to get something to move to a point at a constant pace and stop when it gets there

16489711
portrait	landscape
i m very confused about how to write different screen layouts for landscape and portrait orientations

16489711
portrait	landscape
in android all we must do is to write 2 layouts one for portrait and another for landscape following some name conventions for the file names and when we rotate the device the platform changes the screen layout automatically

16489725
width	margin
if you give your div a width then set your margin 0 auto

16489741
for-loop	arrays
you can easily replace the if statements with hardcoded values with arrays indices and a for-loop and printing with however you wish to record the values

16489748
n-gram	words
i feel like both function can be improved but i can t think of any way to avoid the triple loop loop over the vectors loop over the number of n-gram needed 1-n loop over the words to construct n-gram

16489799
for-loop	arrays
your code looks pretty much what i d do except i d be hesitant to manipulate an arrays while you re parsing through it with a for-loop

16489844
int	chars
when you add say 67 as an int to your chars array again assuming ascii it would display as c

16489844
int	chars
also you would be unable to store the entire value of an int in a single position in a chars array as each digit of the int would require 1 slot

16489844
int	chars
how about using a stringstream place your int in extract a string from the stream then for each item in the string cast it to chars then put each of these individual values in order into your array

16489861
appfog	heroku	appfog	cloudfoundry
i m a frequent user of platform-as-a-service providers such as cloudfoundry appfog heroku etc

16489863
getter	setter
i m surprised nobody has mentioned one extremely important aspect of property getter and setter you can validate the property values

i am trying to get all the post in a thread before or on a certain time

16492352
for-loop	arrays
unless you re guaranteed of the word-splitting in a for-loop as when using an arrays like this i highly recommend using when the command output you re looping over is separated by newlines or read -d when output is separated by the null string

16492381
daemons	systemd
your best bet is to get it out of sysklogd and over to a daemons which is capable of manipulating the template even if it s by relaying to a second syslogd on the same systemd

fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
try closing your fileinputstream after the read is finished as you did with fileoutputstream

16492506
google-chrome	safari
you can debug the web content on iphone using safari or google-chrome

16492518
int	chars
problem is that you assign to a variable of type int thus causing the actual chars code 55 to be printed instead of the represented chars 7

16492518
int	chars
replace int with chars or static_cast before printing

16492528
int	chars
the value of test 3 is the ascii chars 7 which is actually the int 55

16492551
int	chars
int atoi const chars str

the mapping happens after the filtering sorting

16492670

if you want the filtering and sorting to happen in the database then you would need to call .todatasourceresult on the iqueryable before it runs against the db

16492690
width	height
a tsize has two dimensions - width represented by tsize.cx and height represented by tsize.cy so you need to convert those dimensions to a displayable string representation

16492718
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
correct this using malloc free as you did in your previous question actually i think the recommended approach is calloc free or if your code returns to r simply r_alloc

it should be for ie10 google-chrome firefox

16492732

i wonder why you didn t get a notice about it not being defined though...while you re still developing you might want to put this at the top of your code

16493250
for-loop	arrays
i know i can write a for-loop and then append each element of the arrays to the long string twice

16493289

16493495
ready	each
your each function needs to be inside your document ready function

16493501
free	malloc
if memory allocation is a concern then you could free the space taken by the previous string and then malloc enough for the string you are copying but this is overkill in most situations unless you really are worrying about memory constraints in which case you probably wouldn t use the string library

16493520
strcpy	memset
if you really want to zero out the memory before you do a strcpy you can always use memset before the copy

16493525
sorting	filtering
this document also has a section sorting and filtering that talks about sorting with the column header

16493525
sorting	filtering
table sorting and filtering is managed by a sorter object

the easiest way to do that is to change the encoding to utf-32 since there is then one int per codepoint and a codepoint is a numeric identifier for a unicode chars generally speaking

16493851
wan	lan
from what i understand the wan ip address which is visible to the outside world is different from thed lan ip address

16493880
portrait	landscape
on ipad and ipod it is the same for front and rear camera landscape images are fine but portrait images are squashed by 1 4

16493945
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you re performing read-only queries you just want to display data you don t need to make changes and save them back to the database you might check out non-tracking queries the .asnotracking method if you re using a dbcontext dbset or the mergeoption.notracking property if you re using an objectcontext objectset -- that will avoid caching the results in the context increasing performance and reducing memory use

16493969
google-chrome	firefox
it s important to note that calling php s header functions before the script even executes the string you re going to print as unlike google-chrome and possibly probably i m just too lazy to check other browsers firefox appears to make a ping to server to check for headers before using cache

16493973
put	get
i m trying to get an image and want to put it into hashmap using button.onclicklistener

16493982
ubuntu	linux

folder	directory
the backup will be saved in the current working directory in a folder named dump when you use the command mongodump

16494088
put	get
the default sigint handler by the way simply raises a keyboardinterrupt exception so if you don t want to use signals you can put your entire program in a try except structure and get more or less the same effect

16494111
versioning	upgrade
mysql_upgrade cannot and does not upgrade passwords nor does it warn about it in some versioning see

16494160
pop-up	dialog
for example the delete files and directories standard action has a property called files and directories that when clicked will expose an edit button ... that pop-up an edit files dialog

16494353
superclass	subclassing
it sounds like your subclassing s -viewdidload isn t calling it s superclass s -viewdidload like

16494353
superclass	subclassing
that allows the superclass s version of -viewdidload to do its thing first followed by whatever the subclassing needs to do

16494353
superclass	subclassing
if the superclass needs some method that every subclassing is expected to provide then you should put that method in the superclass and let subclassing override it

16494353
superclass	subclassing
normally the subclassing s implementation of the method calls the superclass s version but if that s required then you should document that fact

16494353
superclass	subclassing
the same is true for properties if your superclass needs to access some property of the subclassing backbutton the superclass should define that property itself

16494353
accessor	superclass	accessor	properties	superclass	subclassing
the subclassing is then free to change the value of the properties or even provide different properties accessor and code in the superclass that uses the properties will just work

16494353
superclass	subclassing
in general the superclass shouldn t have to know anything about its subclassing

16494353
accessor	properties
now the -viewdidload method of horizontalmodal will be able to access the backbutton properties even if mymodal has changed the value of the properties or overridden the accessor

16494367
put	get
the other method to get the previews would be to load each and every document initialise it implement readadditionalcontentfromurl error in the document class to read the preview and put it in a property then retrieve the value of that property and use that as the preview

pop-up	dialog
switch to the beta or alpha channel in xamarin studio xamarin studio - check for updates - change the channel in the combo box in the upper left of the dialog box that pop-up - select restart and install updates. this will let you have both android and ios projects be able to link to the same pcl in the same solution

16497277
folder	directory
to get code hinting to play nicer inside your pcl project you ll need to grab the mscorlib.dll from your mono install and place it in a dlls folder in your project directory and add a reference to it in your pcl project

16497309
primes	modulus
your modulus is primes that makes it easy to get a start as by fermat s inappropriately dubbed little theorem then

16497309
exponent	addition	exponent	modulo	addition	modulo
in addition to the fact that finding the exact period of a modulo n is usually far more work than just computing a r mod n for some that makes it very doubtful whether it s worth even attempting to reduce the exponent further

16497309
exponent	modulo
generally when the modulo is not a primes the case when is analogous with n-1 replaced by î n where î is the carmichael function which yields the smallest exponent of the group of units of z n

16497317
stdout	stderr
it seems that newer versions of bash have the operator which if i understand correctly redirects both stdout and stderr to a file appends to the file instead as adrian clarified

16497317
stdout	stderr
i d like the grep to match on content both in stdout and stderr effectively have them combined into one stream

16497324
sdl	lwjgl
i read through quiet a lot of c++ game engine libraries like sdl sfml etc but i am really looking forward to something like lwjgl where the code is similar to opengl native and supports opengl3 above

16497336
superclass	subclassing
because superclass does not have any information about subclassing

16497384
geocoding	geocode
and in return i get some of the points reverse geocode bot for some i get geocode failed due to over_query_limit and it s not the same amount of points that pass reverse geocoding sometimes i get 4 points processed sometimes sometimes 5 7 etc

16497402
allegro	sdl	sdl	lwjgl
sdl sfml and allegro all support using opengl directly so they re kind of like lwjgl in that regard

16497402
allegro	sdl
sfml and sdl 2 let you set the opengl version allegro only lets you use opengl 3.0 or no version specified at the moment

16497402
allegro	sdl
of these allegro has the best documentation atm sdl 2 the worst sdl2 still isn t quite stable

16497447
tablet	galaxy
i have an app which works perfectly on my galaxy nexus but when i run it on the emulator only on some setups one is tablet with jb and the other is ldpi with android 2.1 it crashes

16497456
stdout	stderr
to combine stdout and stderr you would redirect the latter to the former using

16497456
stdout	stderr
this redirects stderr file descriptor 2 to stdout file descriptor 1

16497456
stdout	stderr
stdout goes to stdout stderr goes to stderr

16497456
stdout	stderr
grep only sees stdout hence stderr prints to the terminal

16497456
stdout	stderr
after writing to both stdout and stderr redirects stderr back to stdout and grep sees both strings on stdin thus filters out both

16497497

16497528
getter	setter
i think using getter setter is simpler but here s an example of what i did to make it work

16497567
google-chrome	firefox
the above code is working fine in ie and google-chrome but does not work in firefox

16497741
udp	tcp
note that socket is identified by port number protocol tcp vs udp and the network interface

16497741
lan	localhost
so it should be enough to have two network interfaces on your computer - for example one on your lan card and the other on a wlan card or simply the loopback interface localhost aka 127.0.0.1 note that you have a different ip on each of these interfaces

16497741
lan	localhost
then simply use localhost for one instance and lan addresses for the other instance of your application

16497790
vmware	esx
you can import vmware esx and vmware workstation vmdk images citrix

16497790
vmware	esx

16497873

16498006
width	height
this will take otherimage and draw it on the newimage with the width and height of small_size

16498065
width	height
the problem is that i need to get the jpanel s width and height and when i call this.getwidth and this.getheight in the class that extends jpanel they both return 0

16498065
paintcomponent	setbounds
maybe something is happening between the end of setbounds and paintcomponent

illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
if nothing else throw a runtimeexception like an illegalargumentexception so that your top-level unhandled-exception logic can get control

16498149
width	height
hence the underlying object is of 0 height and 0 width

16498149
width	height
if you wish to use the jpanel values for height and width then you simply need to ensure that you are assigning values to them

16498172
width	height
you could accomplish this with a pseudoelement in the td that takes up half of the width and is positioned on the right to get the full width height

16498203
folder	directory
you can either include a project specific solution in the solution directory and have the project in its own sub-directory or you use a build script in the solution directory that restores the packages in the solutiondir packages folder you can create it on the fly as long as it is inside the checkout directory and call nuget.exe install on your packages.config

16498204
vb.net	vb6
vb is not my native language but afaik the parentheses shouldn t make any difference in vb.net as it did in vb6

hide	show
i explain you i would change all the images css but the first with display none because hide and .show changes the display so you can t show something that is already showed

16498245
superclass	subclassing
an instance of the subclassing is an instance of the superclass

16498245
superclass	subclassing
so we see superclass constructor before subclassing constructor in the output

16498245
superclass	subclassing
this would be true even if the fields were private which they usually would be - the code in subclassing wouldn t be able to access a private field declared in superclass but the field would still be there - and still accessible to the code within superclass

16498245
superclass	subclassing
the fact that we ve got a single object with all the state both superclass and subclassing and all the behaviour any methods declared within superclass can still be used on an instance of subclassing although some may be overridden with more specializd behaviour is crucial to understanding java s approach to polymorphism

16498288
uiview	calayer
however beyond instantiating a view on a background thread uiview s are really just a meta-data wrapper for calayer objects and are optimised for flexibility rather than performance

16498288
cpu	processors
your best bet is to draw to a layer object or an image object on a background thread which is a slower process because drawing uses the cpu as well as the gpu pass the layer object or image to the main thread then draw the pre-rendered image to your view s layer much faster because a simple call is made to get the graphics processors to blit the image to the uiview s backing store directly

16498300
mouseover	mousemove
here s a solution i m using mousemove as this will ensure that the right list item is selected as soon as the mouse starts moving again with mouseover it only starts to select a list item upon entering a new list item

16498300
mousemove	keydown
as soon as a key is pressed at the start of the keydown event use jquery s .off method to remove the mousemove event on the list items if it is present and set mousemoved to false to ensure the mousemove event doesn t get attached again until the mouse is moved again

16498338

16498454
public	protected
they are defined by using one of the keywords public protected or private followed by a normal variable declaration

16498489
folder	directory
if you change that to a relative path say just the name of the mdb file itself no folder or anything like that then it should look in the directory of the executable

16498671
portrait	landscape
your app is running in portrait but the camera is in landscape

16498671
portrait	landscape
when returning to your activity it first returns in landscape and recreates itself in portrait or something along those lines

16498671
oncreate	recreate
you should still be getting the response for the startactivityforresult so simply handle the response in onactivityresult save the intent in the onsaveinstancestate and extract it again in oncreate with the activity is recreate

16498725
superclass	subclassing
if the two custom subclassing have common properties that are not in uicollectionviewcell then you should create a new superclass for them to share that does have those

16499087
mouseup	mousedown
rq if you prefer you can use mousedown mouseup events and measure the hold time

16499091
for-loop	loops
when the body of the for-loop starts with yield then loops

16499094
for-loop	loops
the f option combined with the single quotes around the dir command tells the for-loop that it needs to execute that dir and loops over the results

16499094
spaces	delimiter
the after the f prevents it from matching any delimiter between words otherwise the a would only return the first spaces separated word

16499107
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
i m fairly new to java i have a linkedlist of class objecttype i have various subclassing of objecttype being added to the linkedlist when i pull the object out i am forced to pass it a type of objecttype and seem to lose the inherited properties of the subclass..

16499137
subclass	abstract-class
one way to solve this is to give your abstract-class a method getobjectwidth and override that in each subclass

16499146
width	height
so you define a region of interest which you always want to see completely but you might see more in width or height depending on the window aspect that would be basically equivalent to the black bars when watching letterboxed movies

16499213
put	get
i have a working currency converter in 2.7 but i want to make sure the program doesn t get data it can t process put in by the user

16499227

16499400
hdfs	oozie
i don t see why it won t work oozie just needs to communicate with the mapred and hdfs services but you may have issues at runtime - worth a try i have tried this with 3.1.3-incubating and didn t have any problems with the small amount of testing i did

i think that the simple way would be if you give an unique id for every row in database and then in html table put some edit button and hidden input label with unique id as value so you can use post and open every row on some edit page

16499554
submit	submission
php spoofing error comes after every form submission which doesn t let me submit form

16499559
put	get
look at lì aí åµæ eì í íœí ì ìÿìÿí ìžæžcí ì è æ hæ è 0neì response and change your form or you wont get the right values your values are not the variables in php because you did t put them inside the tags and you didnt echo them to the page

16500107
min	max
you can include other values in the select but you either have to group by them or perform sum avg min max etc.

16500107
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
if you group by id you are collapsing all rows with the same id into one row if you want other columns to be present you must perform an aggregate-functions on them for example we could group by id and get min date and max date to get the min max date for each product id we could also sum cost and avg cost to get summary and average

16500703
profiling	benchmarking
i am trying to profiling some cuda rodinia benchmarking in terms of their sm and memory utilization power consumption etc

16500703
profiling	benchmarking
for that i simultaneously execute the benchmarking and the profiling which essentially spawns a pthread to profiling the gpu execution using nvml library

16500703
profiling	benchmarking
the issue is that the execution time of a benchmarking is much higher about 3 times in case i do not invoke the profiling along with it than the case when the benchmarking is executing with the profiling

16500765
switching	screens
for creating columns and such you wouldn t create one intially but at a higher screens size say maybe 600px you would switching block elements to inline-block elements

16500820
hide	show
the buttons show and hide as expected but when i hover over one of the buttons which are also over the slideshow it disappears which i know is because of mouseleave on the slide

16500820
mouseleave	mouseenter
i then registered the mouseenter event before the mouseleave but it didn t work

16500820
mouseleave	mouseenter
here s the problem despite the mouseenter event for the button being fired before the mouseleave event for the slide the event handler callbacks are executed in the opposite order

16500825

16500992
int	double
my program only converts int to double but i want to ignore them

16500998
google-chrome	firefox
that way on pageload res knows you must ve come from the back button if there s already a location.hash -- unfortunately this particular behavior borked up ctrl-f find in both firefox and google-chrome when a find caused you to scroll to another page page n+1 because a hashchange would close the find dialog which annoyed users.

16500998
google-chrome	firefox
however recently i tested in firefox and google-chrome and it seems that hash changes no longer cancel the ctrl-f find dialog so my suggestion would be that you use that

16501007
width	height
it s similar to the answer here except that i use the view s width height to create the bitmap

16501013
src	attr
you can get an attribute using attr src from jquery

i know f x is continuous and should only have 0 1 or 2 roots for the range in question but it might have a local minimum

16501204
int	double
the reason for your error is that java converts int to double implicitly

16501260

normally you want to create a class derived from a qobject and move that class to a new thread object instead of deriving your class from a qthread

16501374
qthread	qobject
that is why in this example i will use a normal qthread with a qobject based worker instead but the concept is the same if you subclass qthread

16501389
abstract-class	superclass
as far as abstract-class go that is a good decision if you have several tables that should all inherit behaviour from a superclass

16501396
range	max
i need all these 10 arrays to be randomized in range of 0 to 1024 max

16501397

the parent establishes a stacking context and the children have higher z-index than the parent and cover the parent up so that s all fine

16504832
children	parent
now the children have a lower z-index than the parent

16504832
children	parent
as it is the background of the parent is the lowest layer and then the children s background and then the children s text and then the parent s text

16504832
children	parent
so the parent s painting are at the extreme end -- the background as the lowest layer and the text as the topmost layer and the children s content are sandwiched inside these two extremes

16504832

please do not answer to remove the positive relative or to remove the z-index 0 of the parent as that will fail to establish a stacking context for the children

min	max
as far as i can tell the html 5 specification allows min and max in both cases

16506260

16507764
width	height
i m using excellibrary and i want to set a row s height or column s width

16507766
hash	salt
i always store the salt mixed in with the salted-password hash

16507766
hash	salt
the application is aware of this design so can fetch this data and obtain the salt and salted-password hash

16507766
hash	salt
if the password hash data is compromised and falls into the hands of an attacker the attacker will not know what the salt is from looking at the data

16507766
hash	salt
this way an attacker cannot practically perform a brute-force attack to obtain a password that matches the hash since he doesn t know the hash to begin with and has no way to know which parts of the data are parts of the salt or parts of the salted-password hash unless he does know your application s authentication logic

16507766
hash	salt
if the salted-password hash is stored as-is then a brute-force attack can be performed to obtain a password that when salt and hash produces the same data as the salted-password hash

16507766
hash	salt
and suppose you have decided to store the salted-password hash mixed in together with the salt with some of the salt prepending the salted-password hash and the rest of the salt appending it

16507766
hash	salt
when generating the random salt you could also randomly decide what proportion of your salt you will store before after the salted-password hash

16507766
hash	salt
you append the salt to your password and obtain the sha-512 hash of your salted-password

16507766
hash	salt
you then store the first 200 bytes of the salt followed by the salted-password hash followed by the remainder of the salt

16507766
hash	salt
this approach can be implemented in various ways and can be made even more secure by using variable-width salt and or salted-password hash

16507799

-- if a new subclassing object with the defining subclassing extending the superclass is created and then the superreference reference is set to refer to that instead of the original object it is my understanding that since the reference is made for a superclass only members defined by the superclass may be accessed from the subclassing

16514370
superclass	subclassing
if a reference to a superclass-object is retooled for a subclass-object and will deny direct object.member access to subclass-defined members only supporting superclass-defined members how can if a superclass reference is retooled for a subclassing object an overridden method apply to the subclass-object if access is limited by the superclass-originated-reference-

equals	gethashcode
using a custom comparer with the trivial implementation of equals and gethashcode i get a slightly worse performance than the dictionary with a default comparer

16516950
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode equals calls done by the dictionary are either irrelevant from a performance perspective or they are inlined so that the call to comparer.gethashcode tkey key will effectively be replaced by just the integer value at jit time

getter	setter	inherited	properties
this has been caused by getter and setter of pixels properties inherited from tcanvas which encapsulates general wingdi dc object and is not specific to memdc of bitmap

16517414
getter	setter
for the dib section-based bitmaps bmdib a well-known workaround exists however i do not see the way to integrate the proper getter setter in the vcl tbitmap class besides direct modification of library code which proven to be real pain in the stern when it comes to compiling against different vcl versions

16517432

post	get
using get or post will most likely not be a live or dead type of choice but its definitly usefull to make a distinction between the two

16517649
post	get
as the name suggests get is ment to retrieve information and post is used to send information

16517649
post	get
if i would use get i could send you a link like and if you click it you would post it

16517649
post	get
i could post an image as myself like and every user that visits my post would also post that message since your their browser tries to get the image and i have again posted on your behalf

16517649
post	get
now all these security issues cannot just be solved by using post instead of get and would require some more effort on the serverside code

hash	salt
this is the code i have to salt and hash a user s password when they register with the actual password hashing taken out because it was hashing consistently

16518021
hash	salt
what is happening is that when i use the first block of code if i try and hash the salt i find in the database after a user registers it hash to something different than what gets stored in password_digest

16518021
hash	salt
if i store directly in password_digest without hashing it it matches the salt attribute exactly so it seems that they should hash to the same thing regardless of when the hashing happens

16518557
width	height
the problem occurs only with views layouts that have some constant width or height lets say 280dp

16518557
width	height
solution is quite simple if we programmatically set layout params of our views layouts in terms of percentage and only use constant width or height where necessary elsewhere try to use match_parent to fill up empty space or use weights and define every view relative to other views this will help your layout to look good in almost every screen resolutions

16518557
width	height
notice i have used px for fixed sized layout s width height because in the width and height take value as pixels

16518557
width	height
here is an example code of setting width and height in terms of percentage

16518557
width	height
conclusion if you need to set some constant width height for your views layouts always set value in px in layout file i.e xml and then programmatically set layoutparams

for-loop	loops
the issue in your case is not the condition you used in the for-loop it s just that you re overwriting newnum with the remainder every time so newnum is only storing the last reminder that was calculated in loops forgetting all the others it had calculated before

16519556
multiplying	add
to reverse the number every time you enter the loop you should add the last remainder you ve found to the right of newnum which is effectively equivalent to multiplying everything by 10 and adding remainder

to make a layout that fits across all screen resolution i have implemented my own technique i.e setting width and height in terms of percentage

16519595
width	height
the problem occurs when we set views layouts with some constant width or height value lets say 100dp

16519595
width	height
solution is quite simple try to use match_parent so that the view fill up empty space or use weight and define every view relative to other views this will help your layout to look good in almost every screen resolutions and at run time set layoutparams of only those views layouts that has some constant width or height in terms of percentage

i ve had this problem before with controllers and post data as it differs from get when sending variables you need to send your data in json format such as

16523567
int	chars
you should use chars instead of int to represent chars

16523567
int	chars
it s because int is usually 4 bytes and chars is only 1 byte so just enough to represent one chars

16523652
division	modulo
use integer division and modulo to turn tenths of seconds into minutes seconds and tenths

i want to save the files in folder docs which is located in the same directory as application and system

16523923

16524289
int	chars
the problem with it is whenever i read a chars for example and after that try to read an int it jumps to the else condition and outputs no valid input

16524308
listview	gridview
so you could modify the 12 value if you want fewer or if you want no items to appear on the groupeditemspage remove the gridview and perhaps replace it with a listview whose itemssource is the group headers but that s a bit more work and a change in the ui which by all means is fine to do

16524309
range	max
i need to convert a number to a percentage of my dac max value range 0x0fff so my code to do that would be this

16524327
gridview	rowdatabound

free	malloc
malloc will never return the same memory block multiple times unless of course it has been free d since the last time it was returned

16525041
free	malloc
a separate block of memory will be allocated each time since c does not perform any garbage collection and no free calls are done in between the malloc calls

16525047
free	malloc
you either need to keep a pointer to each block allocated by malloc or you need to free between successive calls

16525047
free	malloc
if you added a free between each call to malloc you may end up with the same pointer a quick test demonstrated this behavior

16527559
stdout	stderr
when you run a process it has 3 opened pipes for stdin stdout and stderr

16527559
stdout	stderr
since you never read from stdout and stderr of your child process and ffmpeg outputs quite a lot it will hang at some point

16527559
stdout	stderr
another option would be to just close stdin stdout and stderr of your child process as soon as you launch it

16527559
stdout	stderr
and yet another option would be to actually read and optionally discard everything on stdout and stderr of your child process

16527592
mouse	keyboard
the problem showing up is that when the mouse is left over a part of the expanded list then selecting using the keys is nullified because the selection made by the keyboard immediately reverts to the item that happens to be under the mouse

16527592
mouseover	mousemove
just change your mouseover event handler to be a mousemove event handler

16527592
mouse	keyboard
this way any keyboard navigation and selection is listened to and the mouse position is ignored anytime that the user is using the keyboard to select

16527592
mouse	keyboard
this sounds trivial but it seems to make your js fiddle behave perfectly and without any conflicting behavior between mouse and keyboard

16527592
mouseover	mousemove
your code continues unchanged only replacing mouseover with mousemove

16527627

16527784
width	height
while normal layouts like a linearlayout are bound to an area then scrollview will allow its child to be whatever height it wants to be or width in the case of a horizontalscrollview

16527784

simd math libraries for sse and avx

16528982
width	height
let height be the number of rows and width be the number of columns

16528982
width	height
you might be able to optimize further by using a 2d array which would allow you to swap references to rows in o height rather than copying all the rows in o height width

16528999
subtract	add
if this is actually compiling and running it s probably interpreting it in a manner such as i would recommend using a random object to generate a number then using whether it s odd or even to determine whether to add or subtract

16528999
subtract	add
edit with regards to figuring out whether to add or subtract from the hint make sure you don t randomly generate a hint each time you hover

16529324
for-loop	arrays
i know that if the 2d arrays is int then if i want to assign value to it i need to new int num then do a for-loop to new int

16529329

yes using query parameters with bindvalue and bindparam is considered the best methods for defending against sql injections in most cases

16533386
mouseup	mousedown
i fixed the problem by changing the function that renames the div to be triggered on mouseup instead of mousedown

16533386
mouseup	mousedown
i think the reason this was causing a problem is because the rename function was being triggered on mousedown causing the focus to be set during mousedown but the contextmenu wasn t being hidden until mouseup

16533386
mouseup	mousedown
i can t confirm that s the reason but i do know that the code works after mousedown was changed to mouseup for the trigger of rename

16533541
width	height
i also moved the width and height from html to the css

16533595
width	height
in the xaml you have set the listview height to 70 by setting and the width to 90 the listview will not get any bigger then that you will need to set allow it to grow in height and remove the width 90 or perhaps use dockpanel

the int that is written in front of the chars is the number of bytes but readstreamstr is interpreting it as the number of chars instead

16534002
portrait	landscape
what s weird is that although some images are portrait and some are landscape the js gives all the images the fullheight class

16534038
webclient	webrequest
you need download resume if supported by server you are downloading from which means you should go with webrequest since with webclient you cannot do that probably next versions will support range requests

i am using windows7 and the latest firefox google-chrome versions as of this writing

16534064
width	height
because images in the markup may load before your js runs particularly if they are in the browser cache you will either have to check if the image is loaded and use it s height and width if loaded or if not loaded yet you will need to set an onload handler

16534069
min	max
pay attention to the queries though they are written to target those specific devices so some use combinations of min max widths and heights along with pixel densities to target that specific device and exclude others

width	height
the second one is aspectratio which allows to the define the ratio of width to height

memcpy	malloc
i have some confusions about what i read from the following site about memcpy and malloc

16534628
memcpy	malloc
can be cast to the desired type .. unlike in the case of memcpy above where it is said that it is to be cast into .but while in memcpy the casting is not done even though it is written that it is to be cast in the case of malloc the casting to is done even though it s written it .now i see something wrong in this as for c we are not supposed to cast malloc s return to

put	get
because key one type of id is only which is works to put and get particular value...

16535777
subtraction	addition
if you have a numeric value which is unfortunately stored as a string then we can note and take advantage of what javascript does internally as per the ecma standard which for + is ambiguously trying to guess whether addition or concatenation is intended but for subtraction always means interpreting all variables as numeric data types or nan just like the suggested conversion functions do as a small part of their job

16535795
memcpy	memmove
after reading the following about memcpy i proceeded to read about memmove

16535795
memcpy	memmove
and after checking the program used to illustrate the working of memmove i decided to tweak it by using memcpy instead to see how different is the output.to my surprise they are the same even if it s a case of overlapping memory blocks.here is the program and the output and i have proceeded to describe my confusion after that

if you do not want to repeat the image just use no-repeat but i d recommend using a fixed height and width then

16535954
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
it is not really necessary since the the for-loop would work perfectly fine for what you want to do just write the code look for the first 1 in the arrays and stop loops and use loops index number as the pointer to the first 1 in your arrays

children	parent
generally orms do not provide for pagination of children within the parent object

16536447

cpython	pypy
in addition to everything that s been said here pypy is not nearly as rock solid as cpython in terms of bugs

16536717
hash	md5
if you need the hashing function to disquise parameters so they cannot be altered an md5 hash would be sufficient aswell

16536717
hash	md5
since you need to store the link between the hash and the actual value somewhere they can try to bruteforce the md5 to change the parameter but they still can only enter values you allowed and have in your link table

it s wise to use different salt per each hash

16536838
hash	salt
generate random salt and save it next to the hash in db

16536903
int	chars
in your case chars and int are unrelated to each other so they can not be assigned

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i downloaded the jquery validation engine from it is working perfectly in ie and firefox but it is not working on google-chrome and safari the problem is that it does not matter if the fields are empty or invalid characters are entered the form will always be submitted and since i m using php to enter the data to a database obvioulsy the fields are entered as empty

16537950

but it ensures that there are no content wrapping differences between div s and textarea s inside firefox as long as they share the same fontfamily and font-size properties and so on

16537950
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
if you only wanted to ensure that a textarea in firefox has the same width and wrapping behaviour as a textarea in other browsers you can set its box-sizing to border-box add a padding on both sides of 5.5px and set -moz-padding-end and -moz-padding-start to 0px

16537981
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it works in google-chrome safari and ie but not in firefox

16538023

i highly recommande jquery to do these kinda things but for normal javascript first you have to get the div height which you already done then get the margin and padding separately

16538029
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested in firefox and google-chrome font-face does not work in media print it is ignored by browsers

you have to use the external lan ip-address of your tomcat server

16538408
qtcpsocket	qsslsocket
in my implementation i store either a qsslsocket or a qtcpsocket both of which inherit from qabstractsocket depending on whether the conenction is to be encrypted

16538408
qtcpsocket	qsslsocket
edit i ve just realised that instead of using the pointer i can just have a single qsslsocket and treat it as a regular qtcpsocket when in non-ssl mode

16538425

rss	feed
because of a legacy system i have that produces an old rdf based rss 1.0 feed and the inability of most of the rss readers to handle http basic auth i d like to have a php script that reads this feed and produces an atom feed from it as i have a nice reader here that can handle http auth looks nice but that sadly cannot cope with rss 1.0

16538677
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
it was caused by google-chrome i think because it vanishes as soon as i use mobile safari or mozilla firefox to test the sessions

there exists a file etc init.d skeleton on a debian ubuntu distributions just google for it

16539027

i have a simple jquery collapsible table where the header row is the trigger to toggle the data i want to show hide

16539051
firefox	safari
safari firefox works just fine

16539066
hash	salt
spring security use hash of user password + a salt

16539066
hash	salt
salt is used to defeat pre-computed rainbow table attacks that could otherwise be used to greatly improve the efficiency of cracking the hash password database

16539085
memcpy	malloc
now the problem for me is how to malloc and memcpy

16539088
cpu	processors
if you want to know how many clocks or processors cycles the macro takes to run then you can either use the data sheet for the processors to add up the cycle counts for each of the instructions in the compiled output visible in the disassembly window or you can look at the cyclecounter value in the cpu registers window

16539139

also when i stuff something in here just to get it to compile grid- colwidths col 100 the headerresize event handler doesn t get called if i put a breakpoint in this loop run the program and resize the header it doesn t get to the breakpoint

16539238
getter	setter
in my years of programming i ve often made classes that simply group a few variables with their setter and getter

16539238
getter	setter
now i m wondering if instead of generating a hundred getter and setter i should just declare these fields as public

16539246
int	chars
encoding is the mapping between int which all that a database can store at the end of the day and human readable graphic representations of chars

16539336
int	chars
as other said you can easily read an int or any other object as a chars array

16539362
width	height
the width of the div must be 100 and its height exactly 1 6th of its width

16539362
width	height
note js solutions are not preferred as a zoom orientation change can affect the width height

16539369
getter	setter
modern ides with refactoring tools make it trivial to promote an attribute to getter setter if you want to do any complicated calculations or checks on values at set-time

16539424
serializable	deserialization
the promise of dart is that i would be able to use my types both on server and client but if i have to manually implement serializable deserialization for all my models then it is too awkward to be usable

height 1 6 of a width

16539484
sorting	filtering
i am searching for an elegant library spark for codeigniter that offers you the option to set pagination filtering and sorting without to much hassle and independent from the database query

16539484
sorting	filtering
i am already using a pagination library made by me a while ago very easy to use but i m searching for something that extends to sorting and filtering as well

16539484
sorting	filtering
it supports ajax server-side procesing individual column filtering which i needed by the way and everything you need regarding pagination sorting and filtering datatables

16539506
getter	setter
most programmers will default to private fields with getter setter without thinking about it

16539506
getter	setter
the main reason for using a getter setter combination instead of a public field is that you can change the definition

16539526
octal	binary	octal	decimal
when you have array of bytes itâ s just array of bytes and you can represent it in any possible way binary decimal hexadecimal octal whateverâ but that is only valid if you want to visually represent these

16539546
oncreate	ondestroy
use oncreate method to load your data and ondestroy method to save data

16539546
onresume	onpause
you can use too onresume with onpause method but this two method are reserved for process start process in onresume method stop process in onpause method

16539550
int	chars
depending on architecture casts such as int to chars or long long to int may or may not consume cycles but more often than not they will

16539553
rss	feed
okay so i m struggling a bit here i have a function that gets facebook rss feed however i want the string that it returns to contain where there are any urls

16539557
google-chrome	firefox
in versions of internet explorer less than 10 the system works fine but since version 10 and in other browsers like firefox or google-chrome the autocompletion is defective

16539615
width	height
i have come so far in having one complete but i cannot seem to resize the cells to fit properly the cells width is the height of the rotated table

16539643
portrait	landscape
however for detecting the activities that you mention the result can t depend on whether the user is holding the device in a portrait or landscape position or whether the device is flat or vertical so the individual values of x y and z won t be any use

16539647
setinterval	settimeout
also setinterval is often better replaced by settimeout

16539658
innodb	myisam
a single alter table operation takes 0.1s with myisam but 0.5s with innodb

16539664
post	put
however if the request was post or put patch it means that you need to read the request body to form to do proper updates on the model

16539694
free	malloc
in essence this means that the application mixes allocation using malloc with deallocation using delete instead of free

16539721
ubuntu	linux
linux master ubuntu 12.04 64 bits jenkins 1.514

16539735

i would prefer the 1st one since maintaining 1 value of parent is easier efficient than maintaining list of all children

16539764
public	protected
you ll have to make it public or protected

16539901
width	height
if you use tex2d and pass in x + 0.5 width and y + 0.5 height you should get the exact pixel value at x y

16539926

have a look at following example in which i have covered string int double datatypes

16540050
width	height
in short my uiwebview pulls in some html which has a none fixed height width always the same i just want the height to change accordingly

16540109
width	height
my solution would be either doing a custom resize button slider that proportionally increases both width and height according to the aspect ratio or maybe looking into stagescalemodes keeping the scale as edit show_all while only scaling the background image for example

16540125
matlab	simulink
i would like to open a matlab simulink file from a gui java eclipse select a certain block within the simulink model and somehow get back the path of that block

16540125
matlab	simulink
i know how to implement a browse button in the gui to select the file but i need some hints to go on how to automatically open the selected file with matlab simulink and how to proceed to get back the path of the block within the system architecture

16540224
int	chars
when a string chars is cast to int it evaluates to its ascii number

16540243
versioning	upgrade
if you support multiple versioning a branch 1.0 and a newer one 2.0 and provide patches for both which is totally legitimate approach - don t get me wrong here you will probably have to provide upgrade notes for all these versioning and maybe a matrix that shows from which versioning to which you can go and what you can t do

16540243
versioning	upgrade
i just happened to upgrade an older versioning of atlassian s jira bugtracker and had to find out that they do provide upgrade notes for all versioning

16540243
versioning	upgrade
that would have meant to go from one versioning to the next to finally arrive at the latest versioning i was on versioning 4.x and wanted to go to the latest 5.x and obey all upgrade notes in between

16540243
versioning	upgrade
so i guess you could provide a small script that recreates the index if somebody wants to go from versioning 1.1.0.1 to 2.1 and state in upgrade notes that it needs to be applied

16540243
flyway	liquibase
since you asked if liquibase or flyway can support this maybe it is helpful to mention that liquibase i only know liquibase has a something called preconditions

16540243
versioning	upgrade
but since versioning 2.1 has already been released before knowing that the index might be dropped in a future bugfix there is no chance to add this feature to the upgrade procedure of versioning 2.1

16540283
superclass	subclassing
assuming the subclassing method actually overrides the superclass one the subclassing implementation will be called

16540302
do.call	lapply
use lapply to subset out the elements you want and rbind with do.call on that list

16540373
cpu	processors
when we declare the object as volatile we are actually telling the underlying processors how to work with the volatile object.every time it is read by cpu instruction a fresh copy is called from heap and every time a write is done on the object it is saved to heap and is available to other threads

16540407

might have something to do with the way that the animation fumble with the styles to hide and show the div instead of just plain removing it

16540916

it s using show and hide to replace content because when using detach and attach the map wasn t preserving it s coordinates

now you can change the width of the outer div and the images width 100 setting will ensure that both the outer and the inner div s are guaranteed to always have a height equal to 1 6th of their width or at least as close to exactly equal as it can get the height will be rounded off to the closest whole number of pixels

this sounds like a basic no trailing delimiter problem as seen here but with spaces instead of hyphens

16542698
division	multiplication
to see why this works note that convolution in the spatial domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain and so deconvolution similarly corresponds to division in the frequency domain

16542727
integer	unsigned
the de facto standard is to match insertion order which v8 also does but with one exception v8 gives no guarantees on the enumeration order for array indices a property name that can be parsed as a 32-bit unsigned integer

16542766
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works fine in firefox 20.0.1 google-chrome 26.0.1410.64 m and internet explorer 10 but not in opera 12.15 or safari 5.1.7

16542766
opera	safari
i understand from this answer that i should expect problems from safari however the implication is that it should work with opera 12

16542830
google-chrome	firefox
i have web app which works fine in normal mode and on any version of ie firefox and google-chrome as well but when i run it on ie 10 with no add on mode it ruins my settings of css

16542846
int	boolean
right now i ve defined it in the xsd as an int but i d rather it be boolean for the extra checking

16543181
pop-up	dialog
when i click an event on the calender for a split second i get the gray background you get when you open a dialog then the dialog that is supposed to pop-up just clears the page and opens so the calendar dissapears

16543181
pop-up	dialog
but now i m having a new issue the events in the calendar pop-up on top of the dialog after opening the dialog a couple of times it seems to fix itself

16543192
inherited	properties
this indicates that the bean would not be instantiated and would serve as a mere template of properties that other beans can use through bean inherited which isn t related to java inherited at all

as splfixedarray implements iterator it is easy to extends the class itself

16543274
appdynamics	metrics
i m not sure which metrics or signal appdynamics uses to capture the completion of a stored procedure execution but you could be seeing this kind of behavior if your stored procedure completes relatively fast but transmitting the query result from the server to your client takes a while

16543309
slider	quicksand
and suddenly a few things stopped working quicksand plugin and part of my own jquery code that shows additional data under every slider of a slider

16543369
dtls	sctp
sip is largely transport protocol agnostic so the same protocol can run over sctp dtls and so on

16543369
rtp	sdp
the session descriptions may use rtp for the media streams but sdp is not tied to using rtp

16543369
udp	rtp	udp	tcp
rtp itself is a transport protocol that usually runs over udp because timeliness is more important in a real-time transport protocol than reliability but can run over tcp provided the media is framed - rfc 4103 data is not for instance

16543369
rtp	sip	udp	rtp	udp	tcp
so usually people will run sip over tcp and rtp over udp but neither protocol is limited to this particular setup

16543420
yacc	bison
yacc bison generate bottom-up parsers which are often hard to understand hard to debug and give weird error messages

16543446
width	height
how can i make height also variable like width so that map can be seen properly on any device

16543446

if you change height width of map then you will not get map

16543470
int	double
i want to multiply a high precision int long or biginteger by a small double think about something 0 and 1 and get the arithmetically rounded int long or biginteger of the exact arithmetic value of the operation as result

16543470
int	double
converting the double to int does not work because its fractions value gets lost

16543470
int	double
converting the int to double then multiply and converting the result back to int will not work either because double is not precise enough

16543515
google-chrome	firefox
you have no guarantee of marquee element support across future browsers and even when it s present some of its options might be absent in today s browsers for example i tested mdn s examples in google-chrome and i got a different bouncing effect than in firefox

16543519
serializable	deserialization
i found boost serializable as a suggestion to similar question but can anyone illustrate with a small code snippet for both serializable and deserialization

16543557
portrait	landscape
some say it is portrait how i tend to use my ipad however some say it is landscape

16543557
portrait	landscape
i have this sort of thing in my css to target elements when the device is in portrait mode however i find i don t have the same sort of scaling problems with landscape and hence have no need for the media query below

16543611
versioning	upgrade
your_old_env folder will be properly upgrade to the versioning 2.7.4

16543636
portrait	landscape
the fact that you only have problems with portrait is most probably just a consequence of this specific site s design for others you ll have to do the same on landscape

16543644
thin	webrick
this seems to be reliable for webrick but when using thin the callback is still sometimes called a little bit before the server accepts connections

16543659
haskell	scheme
iirc the first compilation scheme for haskell was called the g-machine

16543659
erlang	scheme
another notable language in this sector is erlang and its bad joke imitation language go as well as continuation-based languages like scheme

16543659
haskell	scheme
unlike haskell they don t use an stg compilation scheme

16543662
mouseleave	mouseenter
unfortunately mouseenter and mouseleave events are also generated when the mouse moves over the parts of my composite that is the label and the button

16543685
hide	show
you can get the last word using and then add some simple logic to show hide the other elements

16543696
hide	show
but now instead the alert i need to check if the value is 3 this is the far i can go by myself and to show hide or append remove a textbox from the next cell or if we talk in a dom prespective

16543782
free	malloc
edit use for definitions of free and malloc

16543790
sessionfactory	servletcontextlistener
a quick fix would be to add a servletcontextlistener and close the sessionfactory in the destroy method

16543832
int	double
i am trying to discern whether it is possible to decompose a double precision ieee floating point value into to two int and recompose them later with full fidelity

16543832
int	double
it s logically obvious that any 64-bit quantity can be stored in 128-bits just store the literal bits. the goal here is to decompose the int part and the fractions part of the double into int representations to interface with and api whose storage format i don t control and get back a bit-exact double when recomposing the two 64-bit int

16543832
integer	fractions	16-bit	64bit
with that understanding the integer part is guaranteed to fit within a 64bit int type then my expectation is that with 16-bit of decimal precision the fractions part should be easily representable in a 64bit int type as well

16543937
hide	show
you need basically two things an event .change which you can trigger when you change the value of the element select and a pseudo-class selected that permit to get the current value of your select so you can create the correct condition that show the four inputs when you choose transfer from ee agent and hide when you not select that option

16543945
many-to-many	one-to-many
with a many-to-many relation i don t have access to my reference table so i ve set up two one-to-many relationships

16543954

16544037
autofac	castle-windsor
famous ones are castle-windsor autofac

16544050
getter	setter
i understand the standard java bean no arg constructor getter setter often serialized but the spring bean purpose seems to be different

16544066
post	get
i want to click on the submit button and get each value from the three input fields to be sent over a post connection so far i tried accessing these values by doing this

16544119
getter	setter
getter setter often serialized but the spring bean purpose seems

16544119
implements	extends
sometimes you implements an interface or extends a class but its all just classes

16544143
implements	extends
you could still implements your own observer method here extends append method

16544239
children	parent
now i filter parent based on children fields

16544257
hide	show
it will show hide a black popup of specified size 300x300 at the specified location top left corner of the screen whenever you press the button

16544262
post	get
when i submit äÿäÿã¼ã¼ã ã in first post i get wrong characters

16544264
post	get
whenever i do perform_async on sidekiqjob to post the data to another rails app i get multijson loaderror however when i create a instance of it and call perform on it works like a charm

16544278
google-chrome	safari
the design is consistent in safari and google-chrome

16544291
datalist	repeater
i know i could use a datalist dataview or repeater to generate the table instead but i don t know how to use them and would rather get this working instead

16544293
put	get	post	get	post	put
after i validate and save the form fields via ajax post i want to put the section into a read-only mode but i don t know how to get a handle on my viewmodel in my ajax call s success callback

16544314
min	max
i need 2 parameters to measure max distance and min distance if it is at max distance it should move forward while at min distance it should move backwards

16544321
uitableview	uipickerview
i am using the uipickerview in uitableview for picking the integer value

16544327
viewdidload	viewdidappear
also i would pass hit to epubviewcontroller and call loadspine on viewdidload or viewdidappear method inside of epubviewcontroller

16544343
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
when creating a qgraphicsscene i usually add all of the widgets to the scene before calling qgraphicsview setscene scene

16544417
d3.js	rickshaw
do anybody know whether images can be displayed on mouse hover event on rickshaw or d3.js graph

16544433
integer	fractions
the goal here is to decompose the integer part and the fractions part

16544433
int	double
of the double into int representations

16544433
integer	fractions
you can t even get just the integer part or just the fractions part reliably

16544433
integer	fractions
they don t have an integer part and a fractions part

16544433
integer	fractions
if you want to store the integer and fractions parts then you ll need two integers that each have about 2 10 bits

16544433
int	double
using two very long int would let you represent all the values accross the entire range of a double with the same precision everywhere something that you can t do with a double

16544433
int	double
you could have for example a very large int part with a very small fractions part but that s a number that a double couldn t accurately represent

16544483
multiplying	add
some languages permit floating-point expressions to be evaluated with extra precision or permit some alterations of expressions such as evaluating in a single instruction instead of separate multiplying and add instructions

16544524
folder	directory
the logs folder is relative to your app s current directory

16544619
implements	extends
public class missionslistactivity extends activity implements onclicklistener

16544652
hide	show
i am writing a script that will show hide cascading lists as options are selected from each of four pull-down menus

16544652

for example when a person chooses a state it hide the default empty list of cities and show instead the appropriate city list for that state

16544652
google-chrome	firefox
it will work in firefox and google-chrome and i was unable to find any errors with firebug but i need this to be usable in ie

here is code which will extract the three constituent int in ieee double format

16544751
hide	show
to show the header the term show is saved to the cell in the database and hide to hide

16544751
hide	show
so show and hide both display the header

16544812
public	protected
focusing only on methods for this question if i create an instance of my object where the class itself is not static then i typically only have access to the public protected and or internal methods depending on scope encapsulation

16544813
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
google-chrome firefox vivaldi and safari support geteventlisteners domelement in their developer tools console

16544853
integer	radix
integer.parseint takes string as a signed decimal integer and that integer must be less than and not equal radix value base

16544868
stateless	stateful
of course static methods aren t always stateless though there are samples of static stateful methods

16544934

menu items are showing nicely in all browser like ie9 firefox google-chrome and safari

16545236
symfony	silex
i think when you are coming from symfony to silex form.type.extension can be misleading

16545236
symfony	silex
so as your code shows you want to add a formtype which exists in symfony but you would use the formserviceprovider in silex without defining an abstracttype and just use the form.factory service as shown in this example

16545280
folder	directory
1 you can store the file in the project directory parallel to src folder

inherited	subclassing
if the subclassing is of the same package those package-private methods are also inherited but they are still package-private

16549932
inherited	subclassing
if the subclassing is of the different package of here we need the parent class to be public with some package-private methods those package-private methods are not inherited because they are not visible at all

inherited	subclassing
when a package-private class is inherited by a pubic subclassing of the same package this is a must its public methods are inherited as public methods and thus they become public methods in a pubic class

16554784
pull	push
committers pull and push to from dev and then once dev hits a releaseable state the sub-directory containing the source code is pushed to prod

16554901
pull	push
rather than approaching it from a pull style look to push the right content and match the patterns that apply

16554922
division	modulo
you can use the modulo and make use of integer division

16554938
width	margin
you can t use width 100 in the case because width is calculated before apply the margin

16554938
width	margin
so the inner div will have 300px width and then 20px margin

16554947

16554987
hex	binary
obviously without a lot more information we can t say for sure but the simple solution in php regardless of the problem is to check for x at the beginning of the returned string and if it is strip that off and then convert hex to binary

16555009
punctuation	words
b matches the zero-width boundary where a words character doesn t have another words character next to it for instance at the beginning or end of a string or next to some punctuation or white space

16555017

if new commits have come in to origin since the last time you fetched or pulled from there you ll have to rebase your new commits on top of those likely with a git pull --rebase then do the git push

16555039
width	height
ie normally i would do something along the lines as position fixed left 0px height 100 width whatever

16555078
pull	push
when you git pull or git push a remote your branch will be in sync with the remote branch

16555078
pull	push
so the your branch is ahead of origin master by 1 commit means that you have committed one time after your last push pull

16555078
pull	push
you ll do many commits locally happily improving your code and then when you are ready you ll git pull and then git push to the remote

16555078
pull	push
after the pull if there are changes you ll re-check your code fix any problems and then push

portrait	landscape
to my understanding you have some orientation issues like portrait video is in landscape mode and sometimes videos are turned upside down.this is due to the default avasset orientation

16558188
post	get
i wonder if there is a clean way to do an html form that will get posted if the user pushes a post button and that could be sent as well with the get method if the user pushes a get button

16558188
post	get
if the user wants to enter data in the database they could fill the form and send via a send button post and if they are not sure what they want they can partly fill the form and push the search button get to receive some insights on what is in the database

16558212
min	max
now i need to select max and min value of a column

16558286

16558371
subtraction	addition
optimal size to calculate most addition and subtraction operations efficiently for the processor

16558371
addition	multiplication
as a result a 8bit addition may take the same amount of time as an 8bit multiplication and etc

16558371
cpu	processors
so while a cpu cache exists on most processors to reduce ram look-up time

16558491
vim	emacs
ocaml modes for emacs and vim work perfectly and they run on macos and windows of course

16558491
vim	emacs
i m not saying everyone must learn emacs and vim

16558548
int	chars
array indizes have to be integral numbers int short chars long etc.

16558679
children	parent
replace 0 will null for parent key in for those nodes which have no children and you should be fine

16558761
hide	show
well what you can try is also to show a display before calling the ajax function and hide it when the ajax request is already finish

16558763
public	protected
here are two sample units to show the visibility of private protected and public parts from a class

16558767

post	get
that works with post but that does not work with get

16558921
dictionary	map
now i want to create a wrapper for it in swig so that i can map them into native types like dictionary in python

16558928
subclass	abstract-class
since abstract-class says it will not give implementation and allow subclass to give it

16558928
superclass	subclassing
so subclassing has to override the methods of superclass

16558950
versioning	upgrade
many of the linux distributions recently underwent an upgrade to xulrunner-2.0 which is incompatible with some versioning of eclipse

16558994

you can also use jquery fadein fadeout

16558995
junit	jmock
i am using jmock 2.6.0 and junit 4

i have tried google-chrome and firefox too and while i do not see the same error message i do not see the svg data rendered either.

16559309
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior manifests itself only in google-chrome firefox handles this ok

16559315
hide	show
you are operating hide and show on the dom element not the jquery element

16559341
hide	show
here s part of the code where i hide and show .chide which is in the document.ready

16559364
children	parent
that being the case you want it somewhere where the parent has control of it and the children have to follow the parent s rules of sharing

16559376

and get redirurl value in form post

16559398
post	get
next there is a post on how to get pcm data from a wav file in java here

16559467
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
however this doesn t seem quite right because you reported a nullreferenceexception and this clearly throws an argumentnullexception

16559478
profiling	instrumentation
hit command+i to profiling the app and select the zombies instrumentation you must be running on the simulator

16559484
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
my guess was that this may be a miss on what should be an argumentnullexception rather than a nullreferenceexception thrown in the property setter s implementation

16559484
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
on quickly checking the code you provided plus a main method with though i find that i do not actually get a nullreferenceexception like you describe but rather an argumentnullexception like i expect i should

16559491
for-loop	loops
it s worth noting that stevens answer works but make sure if using a for-loop to export multiple files to place the clientobject or dispatch statements before loops - it only needs to be created once - see my problem python win32com.client.dispatch looping through word documents and export to pdf

16559532

show hide navigation buttons

16559559

for a p barchart on google-chrome the x and y-axis labels fall in to the axis but when i reload the page the display is adjusted and correct as it appears in firefox and no further reload is need during the session even when navigate back and forth from other pages

16559607
prepare	execute
no you cannot prepare and execute multi queries in one string with pdo

16559648
equals	compareto
looking at the implementation of equals and compareto in java.lang.string on grepcode we can easily see that equals is better if we are just concerned with the equality of two strings

16559648
equals	compareto
when one of the strings is a prefix of another the performance of compareto is worse as it still needs to determine the lexicographical ordering while equals won t worry any more and return false immediately

16559725
updatepanel	scriptmanager
dear friend if you are using ajaxtoolkite and you are using updatepanel or scriptmanager then jquery make a conflict with it so you can use the following 2 method to make your code work properly the bellow code will solve your problem

16559803
int	chars
read int mknod const chars path mode_t mode rdev_t dev_identifier

16559804
hash	salt
other solution is to store the salt hash of the password and upload this

16559804
hash	salt
both solutions are not fool proof if someone is able to get your salt hash or the token depending what you use he she can login

16559812
hbase	impala
hbase is extremely versatile and you can get it to serve both your prod needs as well as your analytics needs however the general purpose sql capabilities in phoenix cloudera s impala and others are in their infancy and the standard hbase way to get high query performance designing the data structure for reads will take a lot on effort esp

16559885
put	get
put all your tags id s classes selectors etc in the above media and you will get your stuff proper for multiple device platforms

16559936

16560044
portrait	landscape
according to apple by default an app supports both portrait and landscape orientations

16560044
width	height	portrait	landscape
once the app is in landscape its width and height are interchanged when compared to portrait view

16560044
width	height
but when giving the bounds it takes into consideration the orientation of the view and takes height and width accordingly

16560044
width	height
when you have view controllers very near the top of the view hierarchy or indeed at the top you can find that you get this swapping effect of the width and height

16560068
teamcity	jenkins
teamcity jenkins or something like that will work

16560150
folder	directory
you appear to be attempting to add . folder chromefolder to the path - perhaps it might be an idea to add the directory that is 3 above it so that googlechromeportable.exe is also on the path - presumably on your usb

16560153
put	get
in any case when scrolling it seems all scroll events get exclusive use of the main loop the solution is to put the timer you are using to do your animation into the same loop mode which is uitrackingloopmode so it too get s use of the main loop when scrolling and.

16560181
int	chars
for simple types int chars void ...etc you can take the advantage of memcpy

howver in firefox tested also in google-chrome i get the following error in dev console

16560295
getter	setter
using voids to change the state is sensible and also making your return methods so that they don t change the state is good too but really the number of arguments you pass in is not decided by whether you have a getter or setter method

16560309
uicontrol	uibutton
a lot of ui items are controls subclasses of uicontrol uibutton for instance and have actions assigned

16560831
public	protected
the access modifier of rendertable is supposed to be public not protected

16560832
getter	setter
one of the problems though is that people would write a class with private fields then have to write a getter method and a setter method for each private field and this results in redundant boiler plate code

16560832
getter	setter
the two bullets in your question can respond to a getter and a setter of a property

16561315
subtract	add
for the right child you should add to x and not subtract from it

16561315
subtract	add
i think the amount that you add or subtract to from x on each recursion should depend on the depth you are at in the tree

16561315
subtract	add
then in the function body you add subtract xstride to from x

16561315
subtract	add
note you probably need to add graphicwidth to xstride when adding subtract it to from x

for example the post method takes a wsdevice while the get method takes a wscollectionquery as parameter used for querying well

16561430
free	malloc
this is not the case openssl documentation says you have to add something like a block size or so thus i believe you have a buffer overflow in the malloc ed buffer during the encryption which causes a crash during the free ... call --- that s quite usual thing when you destroy malloc free data structures by overflowing an malloc ated buffer

16561496
inherited	properties
what you could do is just make a base class put the common properties in there and inherited your two viewmodels from this base class

because some http frameworks don t support passing a body with a get elasticsearch offers a fallback with post as well

16561959

it s pretty easy to run into this limit if you put a lot of things in the request and basically this means urls get truncated

you need to set the actual width height of the image to 100 not the max-width and max-height

16562248

16562292
ienumerable	ienumerator
there s some slight complications to the code that i ve omitted - acollectionofstrings is a little wrapper class that basically passes through calls to the stringcollection but is also an ienumerable slightly baffled that this isn t the case and also that the getenumerator call on string collection doesnt return an ienumerator so you also have to wrap that aswell - what a wierd class

16562349

i use the inner html method to render a page but as soon as i put the id name inside a static method i get an compilation error that states that an object reference is required for a non static field

i need to center an element vertically and horizontally and while i know it s width it s height is likely to change

16562453
equals	gethashcode
overriding gethashcode is required when you override equals otherwise hash-based containers might not work correctly

16562453
equals	gethashcode
types that override equals must also override gethashcode

16562501
datediff	difference
it is datediff that returns the incorrect difference of weeks which in the end results in the wrong monday

16562512

you should post the original file to get help on how to rewrite this script

16562540
src	attr
and yes attr src already returns a string

16562540
google-chrome	firefox
i can reproduce this in google-chrome and firefox so it s most likely not a bug in a js implementation

16562544
put	get
where as my suggestion says to you create the number of section as you get number of dates you get and in each section you have to put number of events that would be the number of rows at each section

16562607
subscript	superscript
now i need to create a text object with subscript and superscript

16562623
int	double
for standard string fields this is fine however for things like double s and int s the validation occurs on property change and so stop the user from typing say 1.5 into a textbox that is bound to a double source they can type 1 but the validation stops the decimal they could type 15 then move the cursor back and press

16562640
width	height
note that this will work with img like object which have height and width fixed but not know to us and for text u need to use js to run it cross browser correctly

i need to to delete the children of a table when i delete the parent

16562745
put	get
however i can see that it s parsing some data as if i put console.log in between store and item elements i will get a valid element.

16562746
width	height
my image tags are sitting inside what is essentially a div tag each the div tags have constant height and width values

16562746
width	height
the image tags are given a constant height value so their width can be calculated based on their aspect ratio and the images do not become distorted when they re resized to fit inside the div

16562787
portrait	landscape
this includes portrait and landscape layouts

16562866
tostring	string.format
does not have a tostring string format overload the easiest way is to use string.format instead which will provide consistent results with the null case for decimalvalue as well resulting in an empty string when compared to your original code

16562871

the challenge is that many of the command-line tools to help with this apt-rdepends etc assume that you re running on the target system and make use of your local apt cache whereas i ll often be handling stuff for different ubuntu and debian distributions from the one i m currently running on so i d like to do this a bit more at arm s length

for-loop	loops
then you go back to the for-loop and i is now 1 but you ll never go though the while loops again because index is too big and instead you re doing some strangeness with your w and i and numbers it appears to me that you re setting ect except in the case where you happen to get two random numbers that were the same in a row in which case you then start doing ect

16570025
width	height
for example if i have a class that defines width and height of a renderable object and i make those variables protected i then can make no assumptions over for example aspect ratio

16570025
getter	setter
critically i can never make those assumptions at any point from the moment that code s released as a library since even if i update my setter to maintain aspect ratio i have no guarantee that the variables are being set via the setter or accessed via the getter in existing code

16570025
width	height
i have a rectangle class with width and height being stored as protected variables

16570025
getter	setter
by constraining the variables to be private i can then enforce the behaviour i want through setter or getter

it s probably not really the regexp that s different but rather as you pointed out yourself firefox adds quotes around the url while safari and google-chrome does not

16572041
google-chrome	safari
which is matched by your regexp but in safari and google-chrome you get

otoh i both understand and fully agree with the recommendation to upgrade all ht dependent packages including durandal and toastr as well as breeze to latest versioning

16572124
addslashes	multibyte
this type of attack is possible with any character encoding where there is a valid multibyte character that ends in 0x5c because addslashes can be tricked into creating a valid multibyte character instead of escaping the single quote that follows

16572141
post	get
read the first 3 steps of this blog post i wrote to get an idea of how to do it correctly

16572161
nsmutablestring	nsstring
then when you try to call setstring on displaystring the actual type of the object is nsstring even though you have declared the pointer to be an nsmutablestring

16572197
google-chrome	firefox
worked fine for me in firefox google-chrome and ie wow

16572281

16572485
clang	llvm
llvm clang with libc++ and not gcc

16572520
nexus	artifactory
many projects on maven central are using this approach and repositories such as nexus and artifactory also support this

16572536
for-loop	loops
note that you don t need the for-loop inside of your while loop--but you would use that loops in step 2 before you enter the while loops

16572543
int	double
this will implement comp so c++ s parameter conversions like your double to int will not happen

16572548
ant	maven
as far as i know there is no ant depend in maven

16572548
ant	maven
but maven compile is using javac and so it had the problems of not correctly finding all related changes the same problem when you build your ant projects just with javac

16572560
google-chrome	firefox
the above works completely fine in firefox google-chrome but in ie it throws error saying gettrend is undefined

the only references to custom load balancer policies i could find are from tomcat 5.x which allows you to extends org.apache.webapp.balancer.rule to implements a custom load balancer rule.

16572785
qsort	bsearch
i hope qsort and bsearch are available in your platform stdlib.h

16572891
pull	push
you should pull and merge locally first don t forget to commit your merge and then you will be able to push

16572898
folder	directory
there is no way to copy this folder high up enough in the directory structure so the tests pass for the build agent

16572919
google-chrome	firefox
you can use this selenium wrapper to drive google-chrome or firefox or phantomjs

you should have a for-loop in your function to iterate over the arrays and not treat it as a single object

16573030
width	height
i have gridview in my windwos store app and i want this gridview to fill whole screen - to have 100 width and height

16573035
post	get
remember that the http protocol is stateless each request exists independent of the others and the only way to communicate state is via cookies a persistent store like a database a temporary store like an in-memory cache or by parameters sent in with the request itself via get or post

16573084
filtering	grouping
i have tried setting up two teams and used tags to categorize the backlog so that my feature grouping can filtering the backlog and see only their pbis

add your files in that folder and in visual studio set each file property copy to output directory copy always

16573511
organization	naming
java package naming promotes this by suggesting you use your organization s url which you know is unique but it can be a pain when registering the widely-used sample code at com.google.

16573520
g++	gcc
i have a generic script that parses the name and obtains the sysroot name and the tool name gcc g++ etc. from it so i can reuse that one script for all tools

datamapper	activerecord
it looks like datamapper might be the solution i m looking for but i m hesitent to move from activerecord

16573918

or double or any udt with an int single-argument constructor

16574099
firefox	safari
i don t have any problems using clip-path with links to .svg files in firefox but safari seemingly refuses to use them

16574099
firefox	safari
if you load my wip page in firefox you will see a butterfly pattern at the bottom of the menu but if you load it in safari the menus are completely rectangular

16574099
firefox	safari
i did a test and created a .svg with a mask tag in it and replaced the clip-path line that appears above with a css mask instead still 221 if you want to try it with the firefox style editor and amazingly that still works in firefox and safari still skips over it

16574112
int	chars
not only is chars is just another integral type but a is actually itself a literal of type int

16574178
getter	setter
you should implement getter setter or make cserviceanalizer unique a friend of cservice

16574216
int	chars
if on the other hand you wanted a comparison that distinguishes that a is a chars and 97 is an int you re also out of luck

16574216
int	chars
in c a is an int not a chars

your first example works only because of shadowing all strings are args and current string given the same named which just shadows original

16574412
lisp	racket	lisp	scheme	scheme	racket
in racket which is a dialect of scheme which in turn is a dialect of lisp you can solve this problem by using a hash table to keep track of the repeated elements between lists with the same first element using the first element as key accumulating the result by means of a fold operation and finally mapping over the key value pairs consing the keys with their list values

16574417
entities	entitymanager
the breeze entitymanager allows entities from different models to co-habitate in the cache

16574460
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
and this happens in safari and google-chrome i do not have firefox or internet explorer installed so i am not sure the response for those browsers

16574486
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this works perfectly fine

16574507
post	get
to bypass this you can either use jsonp which is a very easy solution designed for this very purpose or use the cross site request forgery xsrf protection which uses cookie validation and other measures to ensure security while providing get and post functionality this is not the easiest solution

16574526
width	height
the width of my boxes work perfectly fine but i m struggling with the height

16574569
width	height
basically when i input 2 images to the system i want to make their height similar.then i want to measure template image width and then i want to scan the source image according to that width and examine pixel values.when those pixel values of template will match with source image over 70 then i will give the result that it is found otherwise not found

16574599
inherited	properties
and after this if you have any particular method specific to some of your entities you can all inherited from the repository and override or add methods and properties as nedded

16574715
google-chrome	firefox
this was tested in google-chrome firefox and ie 10 and they all behave the same way so i don t think it is some bug but rather something i am doing wrong not aware of

16574748
google-chrome	firefox
it s the same on 2 computers and with firefox google-chrome and ie

16574766

there to be in a mysql to postgresql migration index name conflicts

16574819
postgresql	mysql
this code checks to see if its coming from a mysql database to postgresql

16574824
int	chars
in c contrarily to php you know at compile time if a variable is of type chars or int so there is no point in having and operators

16574856
int	chars	int	double
first of all since your code does 1.0 a it gives you double 1.0 is a double value 1.0f is float as the rules of c++ and c always extends a smaller type to the larger one if the operands of an operation is different size so int + chars makes the chars into an int before adding the values long + int will make the int long etc etc

16574881
int	boolean
so i create a function called boolean timelag int time int number and each time i pass the time and sequence number into it and expect it will fadeout after 2 seconds after every third object was created but seems that nothing happened

16574883
post	get
currently several post directs me towards changing the default buffer limit in webapi so you get a streaming like behavior

16574954
rss	feed
the best way is to pipe the rss or xml feed that google provide on their calenders then reformat that into a calendar again

16575014
subtract	add
now you need to replace the mediabox entry with a similar array where you subtract 216 72 x 3 from the second value and add 216 to the fourth

16575040
ubuntu	debian
if you are using debian or ubuntu that uses sysv style init process use the following line

16575142
stdout	stderr
note the line with 2 if ran in centos runs fine but the other one gives warning nohup redirecting stderr to stdout

16575161
stdout	stderr
both redirect to dev null the first one redirects stderr the second one redirects stdout

16575161

problem is this code resets all checkboxes on the page tested in google-chrome and firefox instead of just the ones in form#advanced_search

16575347
oncreate	setcontentview
make sure to paste the above code into oncreate after your call to the super and the call to setcontentview

16575360

16575447
getter	setter
but true way is using getter setter

16575453
subtraction	addition
i prefer to manually resize with a large addition subtraction particularly since the user might find it annoying to be unable to resize it themselves

16575465
children	parent
it depends on the element type and parent children anything that can lead you to that element let s say that the element is an anchor so you make it like this

16576021
nonetype	iterable
typeerror nonetype object is not iterable

16576025
istream	ostringstream	ostringstream	std	std	ostream	ostream	istream	ostream	ostringstream
i figured that since std ofstream and std ostringstream both derive from std ostream and i was only using std ostream s functions that it would be much better to have each constructor take an std ostream or std istream argument as appropriate instead of keeping the classes bound to files

16576067

the checkbox must be disabled again if the other radio button is selected

16576590
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox this is usually done by hiding browser google-chrome

16576636
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method must return an equals value for equals items and a simple implementation is above

16576641
serializable	deserialization
php s serializable won t give the same result as .net s binaryformatter therefore the deserialization will fail

16576714
for-loop	loops
take the for-loop out of the disappear and just have it subtract a unit from it each call in the draw loops

16576714
for-loop	loops
you can think of the draw loops as your for-loop

16576786
inherited	subclassing
recently i read that an abstract method essentially creates one marked for inherited and that is block-less awaiting subclassing specialization

16576786
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
what is the difference between creating an abstract method allowing its inherited and making a subclassing version and having no corresponding superclass method and one only defined by in the subclassing

16576786
superclass	subclassing
by the principles of overriding shouldn t a subclassing object automatically use a subclassing method and if there is no corresponding superclass method a subclassing object would always use a subclassing method

16576790
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
autoheight still works under most circumstances but i ran into difficulties in google-chrome and safari but not firefox when i used autoheight false and my .ui-accordion-content included an image whose height was set to auto

16576799
jtextpane	jtabbedpane
i have jtabbedpane and each tab has a jtextpane

16576815
children	parent
if the children are attached to the context ef will generate a delete statement for every attached child then for the parent because remove did mark them all as deleted

16576815
children	parent
if the children are not attached to the context ef will only send a delete statement for the parent to the database and because cascading delete is enabled the database will delete the children as well

16576832
burn	uninstaller
when uninstaller the burn log shows that databasebundle is absent so it will not be uninstaller

16576848
superclass	subclassing
superclass may delegate part of its duties to subclassing via abstract methods

16576848
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the advantage of this is that superclass would contain only the generic reusable logic and more concrete details of implementation would be pushed down the inherited tree to the subclassing

16576848
superclass	subclassing
for example superclass may handle processing of data whereas concrete subclassing may handle data input from various sources

16576848
superclass	subclassing
in this case superclass and subclassing may look like this

16576849
width	height
note that width and height above are the new width and height

16576849
width	height
you can substitute those for the old height and width respectively

16576850
cvs	svn
with setuptools you only need but data files should be under version control system known to setuptools by default it recognizes only cvs and svn install setuptools-git or setuptools-hg if you use git or hg...

16576919
width	height
i would have thought the first one would have worked too since you are only specifying width and height but it seems that it does not

16576920
math.h	sqrt
reading the documentation for math.h it seems like all i should have to do is include math.h and use the math functions included such as sqrt

16576938
filtering	grouping
based on your original query i just removed the subquery added in the where clause the cat title and added a having clause to filtering after the grouping by the webpages that were selected just one time and this selection refers to the python title

16576985
inherited	properties
i ve checked the uilabel and all parent views and have checked that their lock properties is set to inherited nothing and have even set them all to nothing

16577000
listactivity	spinner
example contains listactivity instead if spinner

16577011
pop-up	dialog
this is where i need the pop-up dialog

16577015
superclass	subclassing
if you provided no abstract method declaration in the animal superclass such a function will not compile as it has no guarantee that any of its subclassing has a move method

16577021
daemons	systemd
i have a c program that runs as a daemons on an embedded linux systemd

16577035
for-loop	loops
following loops single for-loop will do the trick

16577059
google-chrome	firefox
i m working firefox and google-chrome and the result is the same in both browsers

16577092
addition	modulo
an elegant solution consists in translating the letter to a number 0-25 and use the addition and modulo operations

16577106
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome ie10 ..but in ie 8 9 i got a misplace of the image like you can see here

16577137
treemap	linkedhashmap
other implementations exist such as linkedhashmap which preserves insertion order and treemap which is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys

16577176
post	get
second the validate uses get for the form submission method not post

16577191
min	max
value becomes the value displayed in an input element and min and max are currently bound to min and max attributes

16577191
min	max
i would then use a custom validator later to handle the min max attributes

16577227
openssl	gnutls
gnutls is order sensitive while openssl is not

16577260
versioning	upgrade
we are doing feature detection on a site i m building but the client insists users with older browsers be shown an upgrade page sorry your browser is outdated please visit xyz site to download a newer versioning once before they can use the site

16577261
hide	show
if you want to use a then you can hide this from css for desktop version and show just for mobile

16577273
children	parent
by attaching the event handler to #parent events triggered by the children will be delegated to the parent and accepted if the targeted element matches your selector

16577292
nstextview	nstextstorage
so my question is if you can spot any reason why nstextstorage would be returning null when there is valid text in the nstextview

16577343
next	except
anyway it is not possible to fix your code as is becuase it is missing parts next to the end - and as it is there is an identation error - one can t tell if the line that goes for child in tree and the follwing are intended to be inside the batch_process function or not - and you are missing an except or finally clause for your try block as well

16577358
subtract	add
so here s what i m thinking of doing use a for-loop and then use conditionals inside the for-loop to determine whether or not to add or subtract 13 places

16577359
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works perfectly in google-chrome v26 ie9 safari v 5.1.7 but it does not work at all in firefox v20.0.1

16577371
spaces	delimiter
so you want to set the for f delimiter to colon and spaces and set the token to 2

16577374
opencart	oscommerce
i haven t used opencart oscommerce etc but i imagine it would be a lot of work to make them share a database with cakephp and play nicely together

16577407
portrait	landscape
if you don t want to have this overlay applied it will darken the button in both states you have to create your own back button images - for the default and pressed states portrait and landscape orientations and retina and non-retina displays 8 total images

16577503
jtextfield	jtable
so i have a set of jtextfield that i want to print on a jtable

16577540
width	height
the height and width properties are also dependency properties

16577572
awt	swing
check out painting in awt and swing for more details about the paint engine

16577627
spaces	delimiter
also the delimiter and the first spaces after it should be ignored

16577659
children	parent
results are not cached since filters propagate from parent to children categories when applied

16577664
postgresql	mysql
i would dump it into a sql database mysql postgresql sqllite and make a call using the odbc driver that you can find in the rodbc package jdbc also works

16577686
google-chrome	firefox
in your example i see that both google-chrome and firefox are firing mouseenter dom events whenever the mouse is left hovering over the and pressing the key down triggers the browser to scroll in order to bring the selected into view

16577686
google-chrome	firefox
one obvious difference already in the mouseenter event objects that the two throw is that for google-chrome mouseevent.offsetx and mouseevent.offsety values are included whereas in firefox these properties are undefined

16577686
mouseevent	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseevent	mousemove	mouseenter
since the mouseevent.screenx and mouseevent.screeny event context values do not change between scroll-triggered mouseevent instances one could perhaps distinguish between an artificial mouseenter mousemove event and an authentic one by storing these values from prior events

16577686
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mousemove	mousemove	mouseenter
also in the section of the level 3 spec on mouse event order it states that when a pointer is moved into an element it triggers mouseover mouseenter and mousemove in that order

16577686
mousemove	mouseenter
every case that is specified there always has those three together so perhaps one might interpret it that if you are going to trigger the mouseenter event you should also be triggering the mousemove event which corresponds to entering the element

16577736
division	modulo
i would suggest when switching back to 1 20 that you move the draggable that it snaps to the coordinates in the grid that you want using modulo division

16577803
put	get
if you can t get the code writing to the stream to put the size in first you ll simply have to loop through and depend on the fact that an eofexception is an ioexception

16577806
ubuntu	linux
it was originally developed for ubuntu and comes packaged with it by default but is intended to be suitable for all linux distros

16577806
daemons	systemd
this approach is similar to supervisord and daemontools in that it automatically starts the daemons on systemd boot and respawns on script completion

16577825
addclass	removeclass
when calling addclass or removeclass don t use a .

16577928
google-chrome	firefox
but when i debug the web only firefox shows the rounded corner the google-chrome didn t change the view i look over internet and the said on google-chrome use

16578002
int	chars
-s is a direct string search so hockey returns players who have hockey listed under sport -i is an int and the search is supposed to return players whose name is a number of chars less than or equal to my int and -l is a letter such that the search returns players whose name starts with the letters between a and -l

16578011
put	get
btw you can put an array in localstorage if you run it through json.stringify and json.parse to get it back or by join ing it with a delimiter you know won t be in the elements | is usually a good one and split ting it later

16578030
children	parent
the new set of children will add the value of the respected parent to there current value

16578030
children	parent
after the tree is created i need to go back through and compare each set of children for each parent and set the respective child sets value that i find to the parent until eventually the root value will be determined

16578039
spaces	delimiter
i have the following file with delimiter of spaces between each paragraph

16578050
width	margin
margin 0 auto will work if the element has a width

16578050
width	margin
so in other words give your menu a width then apply a left and right auto margin to that element

16578073
ffmpeg	libav
ffmpeg libav has a nice simple function evaluator you could use

16578074
google-chrome	firefox
right now this works in google-chrome firefox and ie 9 10

16578102
listview	gridview
1st fragment contains gridview or some similar control and 2nd one contains listview

16578120
pull	push
if your looking for gui tools for a git workflow i use xcode to commit locally and sourcetree to push and pull

16578147
versioning	upgrade
today i upgrade adt to versioning 22

16578152
oncreate	setcontentview
you forget to initialize record11 textview instance before calling settext method on it so initializing it as in oncreate method after setcontentview

16578187
int	boolean
it s not legal because string.indexof string returns an int while if requires a boolean

16578192
pop-up	dialog
the dialog that pop-up is a native to the end user and not part of javascript itself

16578224
hide	show
hide content to show content so that users know to press it again to show

16578225
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r www-data www

16578279
operands	decrement
constant expressions shall not contain assignment increment decrement function-call or comma operators except when they are contained within the operands of a sizeof operator

16578283
for-loop	loops
when i echo them out with php i explode them and loops through them with a for-loop

16578295
pop-up	dialog
inside a page in the wordpress i would like the user click on a text link and then a pop-up dialog box show up with some pre-entered text around 50 words

16578303
int	chars
i declared both id and strid as public int and string respectively in the main class now i m looking to do something along the lines of calling id in another class outside myclass and maybe run it through a couple of if-elses to see which chars to display

16578304
hide	show
or this option where the hide and show are actually both there but hidden pairs and only one is visible at a time

16578325
button	checkbox
i would like to verify that at least one checkbox is checked in the group when a submit button is clicked

16578352
sorting	filtering
i have a gridview with filtering sorting functions working properly

16578368
folder	directory
the directory is rather large 150mb and i am using put function to copy the folder

16578389
setinterval	settimeout
as an aside the same mistake is oftentimes made with settimeout setinterval addeventlistener and the infamous eval

16578412
for-loop	loops
also your outer loops could be replace with a for-loop

16578434
post	get
here is a link to the picture because it won t let me post a picture until i get more reputation

16578484
width	height
i have tried various combinations of this such as adding width 100 and height 100 into the .svg file using preserveaspectratio xmidymid meet adding px to the width and height values using width and height 100 in the svg and other things but none of them have worked

16578498
google-chrome	firefox
the page runs perfectly in dreamweaver but when i tried it out in a browser google-chrome and firefox the javascript flashes for a split second then clears

16578499
getter	setter
and it s better to declare member fields as private and provide public getter and setter for mutable properties for them to be accessed in your other classes

16578513
wmic	tasklist
it seems that even tasklist cannot do this and i would prefer to use wmic since it seems to perform faster

16578519
free	malloc
either pass the output buffer to the function or have the function use malloc to allocate memory which can be returned to and free by the calling function

16578534
google-chrome	safari
you can use the shorthand notation bellow in google-chrome and safari but mozilla don t support it

16578541
for-loop	loops
so i did 2 for loops one that adds the content of list1 and the other for-loop adds the content of the 2nd list

16578561
onclick	onsubmit
try using on the form tag instead of on the button tag and try using onsubmit instead of onclick

16578569
google-chrome	firefox
when i have problems with fancybox iframe popup not working in firefox like it does in google-chrome or ie i usually added this to the html header of the iframe popup page and then it often works in firefox

16578616
getter	setter
i took the liberty of illustrating proper use of getter setter and fixed up some of the variable names

16578644
width	height
my wrapper div on default take window width and window height as its size

16578644
margin	height
i want my content div always fill wrapper height and keep its margin the problem is i can t set content div s height 100 because it has margin and will make wrapper div overflow

16578720
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
i use objectoutputstream to wrap fileoutputstream

16578736
post	get
this all works fine however when the link is clicked i want to pass the string value of the link through a get post variable into a search bar

16578741
coalesce	isnull
i tried to fix this by using isnull and coalesce in my mysql query as i m not sure if the declared variable is null or empty if i don t explictly pass them in my commandline argument

16578741
coalesce	isnull
why aren t isnull or coalesce working

16578746
put	get
and according your need put separator between choice i.e | and press ctrl+space you will get more option

16578771
width	height
in you re dereferencing width and height which are not pointers

16578771
width	height
also in your destructor you re delete ing width and height which are not pointers initialized with new and are therefore invalid operations

16578870
translation	localization
i m applying localization to an iphone app i m working on and slowly going through all texts strings labels throughout the app to dynamically retrive the correct language translation done through localizable.strings - i m testing with two languages to make sure it s working properly

16578894
hide	show
the home page is the main splash page so if you click about the about page will show up hiding the home page or whichever one was open and clicking about again will hide the about span and return to the home span

16579012
for-loop	loops
an interesting thing about c s for-loop all the parts of loops are optional

16579012
for-loop	loops
in this example all three parts of the for-loop are omitted which is legal and basically means loops forever until something stops loops

16579018
width	height
in the area function you should not be using the unary operator for pointer dereferencing because width and height are not pointers

16579042
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
the game runs nicely in firefox and google-chrome and even ie but on safari everything moves really slowly

16579058
factors	mean
but that does not mean that it saves the page number and the zoom factors in the pdf itself

16579062
public	protected
probably the interviewer was trying to see if you would say that all members in interface are public by default whereas in abstract class you can have private protected public members etc

16579116
apache	nginx
node.js doesn t rank the highest but compared to other setups using nginx no apache on their tables but close enough it does pretty well

16579138
hide	show
how to hide show hide button edited as expand here

16579138
hide	show
previously i used the method it hiding the show hide string and working perfectly

16579146

so for portability it is advisable to replace them by std min and std max from

16585438
min	max
the actual difference is that fmin and fmax are mathematical functions working on floating point numbers and originating from c99 and might be implemented intrisically by actual specialized cpu instructions where possible while min and max are general algorithms usable on any type supporting and are probably just a simple instead of a floating point instruction though an implementation could even do that with a specialization of min and max but i doubt this

16585438
min	max
while it is not entirely specified how min and max will respond to nan s i think though from the above definition they should always return the 1st operand fmin and fmax are clearly specified to always return the other non- nan argument when one is nan if the implementation is ieee 754 conformant which any modern pc implementation usually is

ogg opus files have the extension .opus

16586965
opus	ogg
the ogg opus spec is at

opus	ogg
other software can produce ogg opus files too i believe gstreamer and ffmpeg can for example but you can t really go wrong with opus-tools as it s the reference implementation

in particular on some popular platforms and compilers double can exactly represent all int values in 0 1e8 but float cannot

i may be off base with this one but one thing you can do is tag your action methods with and so that the execution will follow different paths depending on whether it s the original page get or form post -back as in

16590898
post	get
but you can really do the same thing with your html.beginform set the method to post rather than the default get as well just indicate that it should be a post rather than a get and it should route to the same action method but with the post tag instead of the get tag

viewdidload	viewdidappear
if the navigation controller is at the top level the tab bar is inside the navigation controller then you might have to set the navigation bar title s manually and you ll want to do this in viewdidappear rather than viewdidload because these child controllers are not reloaded every time you switch

16592416
hide	show
it s not too many steps from that to making one function that can also toggle the show hide

16592424
google-chrome	firefox

currently i am able to stub the getter but not the setter

getter	setter
synthesize was an instruction for the compiler to create a getter and a setter for you and in order to be able to do it s work it creates an instance variable _somestring

16592788
getter	setter
llvm generates getter and setter for you if you don t do it yourself

16592788
getter	setter
but it only generates the _somestring instance variable if it generates either a getter or a setter

16592788
getter	setter
you are specifying both a getter and a setter so llvm isn t generating anything including _somestring

16592788
getter	setter
if you declare both getter and setter you have to define how the value is stored yourself

16593505
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a treeset instance performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the set equals

quicksort and heapsort are both normally considered in-place and heapsort can be implemented with o 1 extra space i was mistaken about this earlier

16594411
mergesort	in-place
mergesort is more difficult to implement in-place but the out-of-place version is very cache-friendly - i suspect real-world implementations accept the o n space overhead - ram is cheap but memory bandwidth is a major bottleneck so trading memory for cache-efficiency and speed is often a good deal

16594435

i pull changes from my upstream and then push them to my origin in this case

16595982

it appears as if the font-size within the div each one of these rows is a div as it s not really a table as i m not doing file browsing per se is what breaks it it seems to make the calculation of the width different because of font-size

16595985

i ve noticed that merge sort is popular for external sorting but i m wondering if it can be done with a heap min or max

16595992

detecting errors on write to stderr or stdout is something that s less often done but it is arguably sloppy programming to omit them

16596162

i made a custom effect method using .animate method to get a better slideup and slidedown method

16596296
post	get
as you can see i have a get and a post path through the action - if i simply bring up the page by typing in the url in the browser address field it works fine

16596296
post	get
comparing the grails log file for both the get and the post ajax operations there are some additional grail log messagesfor the get which reflects the fact it does correctly display the web page

16596340
children	parent
for me the problem was cause by the fact that data parent nodes had 0 children and size 0

hex	binary
maybe you can convert the binary string to hex to make it look less binary p

16596598
setinterval	settimeout
the setinterval and settimeout functions are disabled so scripts designed to wait a certain amount of time before executing will not execute at all

16596609
for-loop	arrays
in my opinion though this could take a lot of time you can create an arrays or a list arrays then transfer all the data there from your dataset through for-loop or any loop...then put an if statement inside to check where you want to put your extra data like this

16596622
vsto	add-in
in vsto i m using vs 2012 with excel 2013 and the ribbon area i create with an add-in looks so plain vanilla font is not able to be in bold etc.. it would be great to extend the look and feel and functionality of this along with tying in event handlers for status updates

16596704
post	get
when using post redirect get the redirect part is performed by the view not the controller as often people tend to do

16596704

the controller has separate routines for get and post an other requests

16596704
srp	principles
but if each of your views contains or inherits pagination then it would be a clear violation of srp and actually several other principles too

the following vba script provides a pop-up dialog which shows the data i need and more paragraph absolute line number relative line number

16596736

16596923
margin	height
in order to obtain the same height i used the content div to push the item div through the padding margin compensation

16596925
width	height
can i set the height of the iframe to the full-size of the document that s loaded within the iframe and the width to full screen width

there is the jquery plugin for equalizing the height or width of elements that s far more better and with more utilities to accomplish this and really easy to use

16596961
youtube	vimeo
i added fancybox to a page to display a youtube or vimeo video when a person clicks on a thumbnail

16596969

this setting exists for the purpose of assisting corporates who are upgrading their ie versioning but don t want to upgrade their intranet software

16597230
superclass	subclassing
superclass has a variable named id and subclassing has a different variable named id and as subclassing is derived from superclass it also has access to superclass id but only if it explicitly accesses it via super.id in code inside of subclassing

16597230
superclass	subclassing
if the reference is of type superclass then it s superclass id which is accessed whereas if the reference is of type subclassing then it s subclassing id which is accessed

16597230

16597319
shibboleth	simplesamlphp
now simplesamlphp the latest release has configuration files for saml 2.0 and shibboleth 1.3

16597319
shibboleth	simplesamlphp
my hope is that shibboleth 2.2 is a standard saml 2.0 implementation and for shibboleth 2.x you would use the regular saml2.0 configuration files in simplesamlphp rather than special shibboleth configuration

16597319
shibboleth	simplesamlphp
if not how do you configure simplesamlphp for shibboleth 2

16597387
accessor	properties
technically you don t know what the accessor does internally it could deep copy for all we know but the properties tells you that it will at least copy the array so that if you choose to change the array contents afterwards assuming it s mutable then everything will continue to work

16597408
octal	hex
in another question someone suggested echo -e with for octal and for hex

16597423
octree	quadtree
note the port is currently in 2d on a quadtree instead of 3d on an octree but only because one dimension is commented out for my 2d javascript engine

16597434
folder	directory
all i had to do was move the folder that contained all icons outside of the password protected directory

16597441

if you have an nsstring property for example you should make it copy not merely strong lest a client hand you an nsmutablestring keep a reference to it and mutate it

16597449
for-loop	arrays
for some reason this only plays the first note 10 times - it doesn t seem to understand the new arrays values so it always gets hung up on the first if statement in the for-loop

16597461
nav	affix
i am trying to affix an image to the bottom of a nav list and have it stay there when the page scrolls

16597478

integer	fractions	fixed-point	fractions
8.24-bit fixed-point format is used to represent float numbers with fixed precision - a 32-bit integer where the first 8 bits represent the whole part and the last 24 bits represent the fractions part the numbers after the decimal

16607077
integer	fractions
that is extract the sign from the 8 msb extract fractions value from 24 lsb and divide by range of 24-bit integer 2 24 resulting in a float between 0 and 1 and finally multiply this by 32768 to get a value in desired range

16607083
sorting	filtering
it works because selected client is null when the page is refreshed while paging sorting and filtering automatically sets the selected client to null

16607796
versioning	upgrade
also i think codemirror has been added to phpmyadmin in versioning 3.5 so if you have an older versioning you probably will need to upgrade

16607813
google-chrome	safari
if you would open this page in google-chrome or safari you will notice the following behavior

16607813
width	height
when resizing the browser window horizontally the image grows and shrinks in width yet with respect for a maximum height of 100 of the browser window

16607813
width	height
when resizing the browser window vertically a height of 100 is enforced and the width may shrink or grow according to the aspect ratio of the image up to a certain maximum

16607813
width	height
the img element has no explicit width or height set inline i control this in css

16607813
box-sizing	border-box
note i m using box-sizing border-box on all elements

16607817
width	height
browser always returns 0 width and height of an element if it is not visible

16607953
for-loop	loops
the same is not evident for a manually unrolled for-loop where just by looking at the first line you do not know whether the i variable will be incremented or manipulated anyhow inside loops

profiler	yourkit
you could use the visual studio 2012 performance analysis which is really handy if you re using vs2012 otherwise you may want to install a profiler tool such as yourkit

16608276
stdout	stderr
so you have to redirect stderr instead of stdout

16608301
min	max	range	max	range	min
unless your range are stored in order you will have to visit each one as one range may contain a min max

16608301
min	max	range	max	range	min
or non accumulating where min max is local to each range not all the range

16608301
range	min
if your range were sorted in some manner then you could look at the extreme ends if the end s min is greater than the targetmax then say look at the range 1 4 backwards from the end etc.

16608307
width	height
in ie10 if a is present inside a the height width attributes of an iframe given in percentage doesn t pay much heed to the height width of its parent

16608307
width	height
like in the following example iframe with the id test takes height width 100

16608307
width	height
so i guess there is something wrong with the way ie10 interprets width height attributes of an iframe

16608315
int	chars
only having single digit int in an array of chars strictly greater than zero

16608359
behat	mink
i use behat and mink for integration testing in my symfony2 project and have used the following syntax across the site with success but in one place i am getting really strange errors that don t seem to make any sense to me

16608395
width	height
in ie10 if an is present inside a the height width attributes of an iframe given in percentage doesn t pay much heed to the height width of its parent

16608395
width	height
like in the following example iframe with the id test takes height width 100

16608395
width	height
so i guess there is something wrong ie10 interprets width height attributes of an iframe

16608403
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but in google-chrome it always shows invalid file although file is valid

16608451

my problem is whenever i display large strings which are imported from tab delimiter files only which have spaces in them they won t wrap inside div table cells e.t.c

16608504
viewdidappear	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear
so use those methods to set params to the view controller like array of objects or any kind of data and apply the ui changes for the view controller s view in viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear methods of your view controller

16608531
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
superclass s members will be inherited by subclassing object

16608536
uiview	subviews
selecting on each tab item adds same four view controllers which contains uitableviews as the subviews of incomevc and expensevc like for eg dailyvc weeklyvc monthlyvc yearlyvc. ie for income there is daily weekly etc and same for expense i have done like that because the incomevc and expensevc have a uibutton and a uiview which is common for all tabs

16608572
hash	salt
sha1 salt + stage 2 hash xor stage 1 hash 4b19199eceb929469ea89c0e942d8d5b9acbe237

16608572
hash	salt
i am not sure if i should be computing the sha1 salt + stage 2 hash with an asterisk or not as in the database it shows an before the password

16608610
express	node.js
currently using node.js along with mongoose and express

16608618
google-chrome	firefox
as such i think you need to debug the value of uploadcontrol in google-chrome and firefox to see how they differ then tune your regex

16608632
websphere	ibm
select the method download director or http instead of installation manager recommended at the download page of evaluate ibm websphere application server

16608632
websphere	ibm
then you get a list of products to download which contains ibm websphere sdk java 7 installation manager repository

spaces	linefeed
the characters character tabulation u+0009 linefeed u+000a line tabulation u+000b form feed u+000c carriage return u+000d next line u+0085 and no-break spaces u+00a0

16608785
int	double
you may need to address precision issues when going from double s to int s because the calculations will be approximate

16608830
floating-point	integer
once you have the number of generations as a floating-point number you can just truncate that to an integer number of hours

16608871
integer	unsigned
this would be evident from context or from additional documentation not supplied in the question. letâ s suppose the additional bit is an integer bit and the value is unsigned

16608871
integer	unsigned
if the 16 bits have the value x when interpreted as an unsigned integer then they have the value x 2 15 when interpreted as a q15

16608871
floating-point	integer
so given some value y which may be a cosine or sine for one of your twiddle factors you can convert it to the integer that you will store in the 16 bits by multiplying by 2 15 as with the code and converting from floating-point to integer

16608871
floating-point	integer
however the conversion from floating-point to integer truncates toward zero so 33.9 becomes 33

16608908
libsvm	liblinear
instead you should consider things like liblinear by the same authors as libsvm pegasos or svm perf

16608993
pop-up	dialog
this stackoverflow have discussion about pop-up a dialog box with disabling the parent web page content

16608993
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a dialog box with disabling the parent

16609062
int	double
this works whenever i use int but the movement is too fast so i want to use a double

16609062
int	double
if i use a double it says cannot implicitly convert type double to int

16609062
int	double
and i cant change the cloudx to a double because the spritebatch function wants int only

16609147
post	get
last but not least ensure that you have selected post in the fiddler combobox with the verbs the default is get

16609148
width	height
but following code shows real image width and height

16609153
oncreate	onstart
according to the activity lifecyle the oncreate is before the onstart and i guess that applies as well for fragmentactivity

16609158
floating-point	integer
these rules may say that parameters of certain types are passed in certain registers integer types in general registers and floating-point types in separate floating-point registers that large arguments such as structures with many elements are passed on the stack or by a pointer to a copy of the structure and so on

16609158
int	double
when you pass an int in an argument to printf but pass it f in the format string you are putting an int somewhere but telling printf to look for a float that has been promoted to a double

16609158
int	double
if the rules for your c implementation specify that the int argument is passed in the same place as a double argument then printf will find the bits of your int but it will interpret them as a double

16609158
int	double
on the other hand if the rules for your c implementation specify different places for the arguments then the bits of your int are not where printf looks for the double

16609158
int	double
also many c implementations have 32-bit int types and 64-bit double types

16609174
move	drag
with this the javascript can be simplified to match up the drag- id to the answer- id and using the position jquery method to move the drag elements to the correct places

16609311
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so far it s working in google-chrome firefox opera and safari all current versions i didn t get to testing on ie yet

16609314
ppl	tbb
i believe that both the microsoft ppl implementation of concurrent_unordered_map and the intel tbb implementation currently have a lock per hash bin

16609339
width	margin
you also need to calculate margin padding and border space into your total width as well and obviously you can t have more than 100

16609348
websphere	ibm
we are using ejb 2.1 with container managed persistence in ibm websphere 8 and have the following problem a single object finder sometimes return 2 elements even though there is only one element the database for this search criteria

16609361
put	get
a get put accessor pair to hide the hairier syntax

16609361
put	get
data and cols could be parameterized for the get and put calls etc but this script doesn t go that far

16609436
int	chars
i ve currently got an int that contains ascii chars codes however with the ascii table any value 32 is a control code

16609436
int	chars
so what i need to do is for any value 32 put the ascii chars into a chars however if it s 32 just put the literal int value in as a chars

16609515
rss	feed
so i m developing a project on vb.net to manage rss feed and if they have a file attached it downloads automatically the files to a folder

16609549
google-chrome	safari
i ve been working a bit on this and have found that google-chrome 26 and safari 6 did the old model

16609571
int	chars
to store either a chars or an int you could try using a wrapper object to do that

16609580
solaris	bsd
all this is too dangerous for an operating system to allow so all operating systems i ve looked at bsd linux solaris close the file descriptor even if the underlying filesystem close operation has failed

16609584
versioning	upgrade
if we did that we would probably prune along the way physically deleting the really old upgrade scripts once everybody was past that versioning

16609627
post	get
since i m unable to get the wcf call through jquery ajax using post method work i m using get method

16609627
hash	md5
anyone who knows the combination used to build the string to encrypt will be able to generate md5 hash and use

16609651
width	height
if you want preview layout for a moment you can temporally change the width and height to absolute

16609671
put	get
remove all extra elements from string say and put number and symbols in separate queue and then get each element from both the queue and at same time keep on checking weather it is a number or not if it is a number get next element as a symbol

16609710
int	chars
however when i print the string that i get with a special function that tells me the int values of each chars a function which is shown here

16609776
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i want to allow to call my api from fron-end developers computers and we ve found an error when we use ie10 and firefox 21.0 but not with google-chrome 26.0 and safari 5.1.7

16609782
background-image	background-color
it appears to be overriding your background-color attribute going by the background-image property in the current style list - unless you re giving it a background-image elsewhere - if so that code hasn t been provided

16609797
bitwise-and	modulo
the first snippet would work correct if the modulo were to be replaced by bitwise-and operator

16609819
google-chrome	firefox
this api is not yet supported cross-platform but it may work for some platform such as recent firefox and google-chrome

16609828
mouse	keyboard
things like user interaction mouse clicks keyboard presses etc. and painting messages when controls are changed your window is obscured are placed into a queue

16609839
width	height
and also ensure that label has proper height given that width is already set

16609911
hash	md5
hash a password with javascript requires some code because there isn t functions to hash in md5 or sha1 directly

16609928
wildfly	jboss
jboss eap 6 is a red hat supported release based on open source jboss 7 now called wildfly

16609942
nexus	artifactory
the mostly used once are artifactory and nexus

16609983
min	max
presumably the commission can fall between the min and max values

16609986
jar	war
in java an similar to other thechologies you usually package compiled code using either jar war or ear

16609986
jboss	glassfish
then you have to install those files myapp.war into another webserver such as tomcat glassfish jboss or the like

16610032
google-chrome	safari
prominent examples qt webkit used in google-chrome and safari

16610036
children	parent
parent will normally expand to the height of their children though won t in case the children are floated

16610069
width	height
lets say you have a height of 10 and a width of 90 single dimensional array will be 900

16610069
width	height
ironically if you the height width you will not experience an overflow just complete bonkers results

16610072
hide	show
try using min-width to show your large footer and hide the small

16610074
width	height
as you can see the div1 is resizable draggable and has absolute width and height

16610074
width	height
div2 has 100 width and height and has absolute position

16610102
for-loop	loops
the for-loop will never make loops 1000 because the condition will stop loops before the condition is true so when the for-loop finishes loops will equal 999

16610115
children	parent
after hidden parent is made visible it s children are remaining invisible

16610115
hide	show
is it possible to hide and show the full root div without affecting the inner elements

16610115
hide	show
i have to hide the child elements also but when i show the root the child elements should also be showed

16610127
put	get
you need to put a swipe gesture recognizer onto the imageview and when you get the callback choose the right image from the array

there are tcpdump filters for http get http post or for both plus message body

16610391
try-catch	exception-handling
i put my reduce and map logic inside a try-catch block with the catch block incrementing a counter whose group is exception-handling and whose name is the exception-handling message

16610441
implements	extends
i usually implements this by extends the collectionview class

16610474
scrollable	panels
then you will be able to place a button on a form but over this scrollable panels

16610506
webkit	gecko
also it should work in ie7 8 so i m trying to avoid css3 and webkit gecko only features

16610525
mouse	keyboard
but from the java doc i think that this method cannot distinguish if the os supports graphics but rather than if the os can support one of the i o devices keyboard mouse screen

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this only happens with google-chrome i can save password perfectly with firefox and opera

16610720
google-chrome	firefox
this code causes no issues in firefox and so does seem specifically to be connected to google-chrome dev tools

16610754
spaces	delimiter
the delimiter are + - and spaces and i need them as an independent token

16610754
spaces	delimiter
i read a lot of questions about similar problems with less complex delimiter and the common answer was to use zero spaces positive lookahead and -behind

16610755
equals	gethashcode
its value can be stored into a string and we have to redefine equals object gethashcode and it is equatable to itself so it can implement iequatable

16610758
mongodb	bson
all documents in mongodb are stored in bson format

16610774
google-chrome	firefox
for example google-chrome shrinks the page and print a blurred text on the receipt but firefox just print the right side only of the page magnified as if it was an a4 page

16610807
min	max
if you take out the min and max values for each of the y-axes both series data are shown but the axis labels on the right hand side disappear as if the 2nd series is just being displayed against the y-axis on the left

16610808
post	get
product_id 5 this value send it with post i well never get product_id 5 but product_id 0

16610842
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox etc

16610862
int	double
the file contains two strings a double and an int all on different lines with each group of separated by a blank line

16610862
int	double
itemnumb and itemname are the string vectors itemcost is the double and itemquant is the int

16610862
int	double
the lines for the strings don t give an error but the lines for the double and the int give the same error with the type changing based on which vector it is

16610908
hide	show
to show and hide them no need to be disabled

16610920
inherited	properties
solution 1 add a validated properties to the item itself by forcing items added to the collection to inherited from a base class

16610929
google-chrome	firefox
i have an ajax call via jquery.ajax google-chrome and firefox works fine

16611005
int	double
to read int and double you should use overloaded like this

16611007
post	get
thanks to this post and to jucas in particular i managed to get it to work

16611023
google-chrome	firefox
looking in firefox it does return a 403 unlike google-chrome

16611027
inherited	properties	children	parent
the problem is that some properties like text-decoration get drawn to the whole parent inline element whereas others - like font styling that get inherited - get overriden by the children properties

16611032
interbase	firebird
i have verified that the procedure is returning data in ems sql manager for interbase and firebird

16611038
scrollable	panels
in order to be able to scroll with the mouse wheel the focus must be on a control inside the scrollable area inside the panels not on the button

16611053
put	get
it is not surprising to me that this code compiles but rather that the classcastexception occurs on the get line as opposed to the put line above it though i do have an educated guess as to what what may be occurring

16611080
hash	md5
i need to add another columnc the value of which is md5 hash output of columna

16611080
hash	md5
is there a way sqlite can add columnc and set its value to md5 hash either using an existing sqlite internal function or my custom function

16611092
integer	unsigned
you are telling gldrawpixels that your data is sizexsize pixels and each pixel has 3 components gl_rgb of 32-bit unsigned integer type each gl_unsigned_int

16611114
children	parent
3 to remove that item from a lazy load of the parent children collection we can append a where clause to the collection mapping

16611143
width	height
when i set depending like window_width self.frame.size.width and window_height self.frame.size.height and rotate in landscape mode or start from it - texture displaying bigger in width and smaller in height than screen size

16611149
subtract	add
if you want to include the 0.06 row just before and after the inner range subtract 1 from inner.start and add 1 to inner.end

16611150
width	height
i need the thumbnails to never exceed a certain width height so that they stay in a neat order for viewing pleasure

16611150
width	height
as you can see in my code below i ve tried both of those but despite specifically setting a max height and width they still expand and make the thumbnails awkward sizes

16611182
tinyint	boolean
mysql does not store true and false the datatype behind boolean is tinyint 1

16611259
viewdidload	viewdidappear
solution needed to move the observer from viewdidload to viewdidappear .

16611267
pop-up	dialog
if you want to use a custom pop-up with your own xml layout i recomand you to use a dialog and use setcontentview like this

16611268
setinterval	settimeout
you need to replace setinterval with settimeout if you only want it to occur once in that case

16611330
onclicklistener	ontouch
like have your implementation of the onclicklistener on touch listener that developers will extend to use with ontouch on click

16611340
inherited	properties
although i would discourage adding a properties to the object s prototype because it is enumerable and will mess up looping and will be inherited by all objects and objects that inherited from object which is basically everything

16611346
subtraction	addition
in practice signed integers are two s complement which makes no difference in addition or subtraction so correct under overflow behavior is guarranteed for signed integers too although not by c

16611371
junit	servicetestcase
i tried using servicetestcase but it appears that whenever i send a message to the messenger of my service either junit finishes prematurely this is supposed to be ipc and the handlemessage of the handler is not getting called or junit is not supposed to be used for testing things like this it should be

16611408
for-loop	arrays
you need a nested for-loop to iterate over the original arrays

16611461
yacc	bison
in c you would use lex and yacc or gnu flex and bison

16611530
aggregate-functions	sum
unless i am missing something you should be able to use the following which applies the aggregate-functions sum with a group by the sid

16611536
devise	cancan
i am following the tutorial for devise and cancan integration for rails

16611537
hide	show
for this you can ignore the keyboard show hide notifications and just use the uitextfielddelegate protocol

16611538
hash	md5
the problem is that amazon says that the md5 hash i submitted does not match their calculations so my request was rejected

16611544
jaydata	breeze
i ve never used breeze with jaydata server but i ve been using jaydata client library to save data over odata for a year and it works with static schema you generate it with jaysvcutil and dynamic schema grabs the metadata from the server in runtime as well.å

16611774
range	minimum
now what i want to do is that when first_date is selected than the minimum range of the second_date is auto filled by javascript

16611781
versioning	upgrade
when they then upgrade back to the full versioning - full versioning is in the app store the lite versioning is no - it overwrote back to the full versioning

16611833
ssl	https	post	put
exactly which pages you put inside ssl has a big impact on security too though - suppose you send a login form using http with a post target which is https - a trivial analysis would suggest this is secure - but in fact an mitm could modify the login page to send the post elsewhere or inject some ajax to fork a request to a different location

16611833
ssl	spdy
spdy requires ssl but makes most sites especially ones that have not been heavily performance optimized much faster

16611833
ssl	https
using good cdns over https also mitigates much of the performance impact of ssl

16611860
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome ie firefox has one parent process and some render processes

16611862
pop-up	dialog
you mentioned you have your own xml layout for the dialog pop-up here s another solution just a bit different from the one of jarvis

16611965
put	get	post	get	post	put
i don t just want to route the standard methods like head get post options delete put

16611985
rubygems	bundler
usr lib ruby site_ruby 1.8 rubygems dependency.rb 247 in to_specs could not find bundler 0 amongst actionmailer-2.3.15 actionpack-2.3.15 activerecord-2.3.15 activerecord-mysql2-adapter-0.0.3 activeresource-2.3.15 activesupport-2.3.15 cgi_multipart_eof_fix-2.5.0 daemons-1.1.9 fastthread-1.0.7 gem_plugin-0.2.3 mongrel-1.1.5 mysql2-0.3.11 rack-1.1.5 rails-2.3.15 rake-10.0.3 rubygems-update-1.8.25 sqlite3-1.3.7 gem loaderror

16611996
width	height
weather is calling the jquery or not your jquery function is called or not and put the image width and height to 100 and if you give me your site link i will do for you

16612061
move	drag
so basically if the user drag one of the handles then the other handle will move with it but never get close or further away

16612063
highcharts	highstock
i want to change axis label size when exporting image using highcharts highstock

16612103
subshell	ifs
i ran that in a subshell to localize changes to ifs

16612134
google-chrome	firefox
this issue happens on google-chrome firefox and ie

16612152
uicollectionview	uipageviewcontroller
as others have suggested if you don t want to write your own image handling code like above you could use a variety of other controls a uipageviewcontroller a uicollectionview or any of a dozen other classes that facilitate navigation between a group of images

16612202
width	height
then just target the images specifically and layer them giving the background a 100 width and height

16612229
post	get
same response for get post

16612257
children	parent
parent will normally expand to the height of their children though won t in case the children are relative

16612324
lxml	beautifulsoup
in some cases say if you re building some kind of html munger on top of lxml or beautifulsoup it might also be appropriate to use an exception from some other module

16612339
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in firefox but it behaves erratically in google-chrome it only partially sorts

16612503
fadein	fadeout
when you pass fadeout fadein to the settimeout calls you do not specify the element parameter it is expecting

16612521
put	get
for example one of the get parameters it has put javascript alert 1

16612523
innodb	myisam
how do we know which variables are innodb engine orientied some are only used in myisam engine

16612585
post	get
after the form post and i look at it in the _files object the name i get back is

16612613
post	get
get parameters and post bodies are the primary vector for attacking a web application via http requests but there are others

16612613
post	get
any time a get or post parameter that is controlled by an attacker is turned into code or a programming language symbol you risk a code-injection vulnerability

16612613
post	get
if a get or post parameter is naively interpolated into a string of sql then you risk sql injection

16612613
post	get
if a get or post parameter or header like the filename in a file upload is passed to a shell then you risk shell injection and file inclusion

16612633
hex	binary
this function will take a hex string and convert it to binary which is what you want to actually send

16612633
hex	binary
the hex representation is for humans to be able to understand what is being sent but whatever device you are communicating with will probably need the actual binary values

16612662
qthread	qmutex
i have a c++ qt program that uses qthread with pause resume mechanism implemented using qmutex and qwaitcondition

16612707
google-chrome	safari
now google-chrome and safari work just fine

16612707
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see it works on google-chrome but not on firefox

16612759
post	get
alternatively you could have a .js file in a folder with a .htaccess file that tells you to execute it as php allowing you to simply generate the script on the fly based on session get or post parameters

16612764
hide	show
anyway so i m trying to show hide divs based on select box values

16612764
ng-switch	ng-show
update the solution for my case at least was to not mix ng-switch and ng-show

16612783
inherited	properties
because refers to the controller and the controller inherited the properties called

16612796
button	checkbox
2 radio button that enable+tick their checkbox when selected and disable+untick them when the other radio button is clicked

16612852
width	height
the browser doesn t render a correct width and height

16612864
int	boolean
this boolean value is then implicitly cast to an int and assigned to x

16612923
scheme	racket
in racket scheme we can do a lot better and generate only the values as needed if we use lazy sequences like this but be aware - the first solution is still faster

16612958
portrait	landscape
my query is about images the portrait mode is 320x960 px and landscape is 960x320px

16612958
portrait	landscape
all the images are stored in a database but i can manipulate which folder they come from where i have so one set of images will be in a landscape folder and another set in a portrait folder

16612976
phpstorm	webstorm
so i just started using webstorm phpstorm

16613004
folder	directory
i have index.php in the directory as the folder icons and in icons there is an image called logo.png

16613016
explode	implode
the answer was explode r n result but thanks for showing me the implode function everyone

16613017
width	height
height and width aren t

16613033
ilist	icollection
you would either have to write the name out by hand not robust have some sort of intermediary collection type with the index operator like ilist that you keep in sync with the icollection

16613066
bmp	png
i could make every file of that type have the same standard icon like how all html files look the same or all txt files but what i want to do is have every file show a preview of itself for its thumbnail more like how jpg bmp and png show a thumbnail of that particular image file

16613076
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome can pick up opensearch specifications from web pages allowing the user to add your site as a custom search engine

16613081
ssl	https
in my app i m using https and a self-signed ssl certificate to secure the connection between my client and the server

16613087
superclass	subclassing
orange apple and banana will all superclass fruit and each of them will provide an implementation of process which takes the appropriate action for that particular type subclassing of fruit

16613139
int	double
edit should ve clarified itemnumb and itemname are string vectors itemcost is a double vector and itemquant is an int vector

16613139
int	double
tempstr1 and 2 are strings tempdoub is a double and tempint is an int

16613149
passenger	webrick
works fine on local machine development and production running webrick but passenger causes a crash

16613198
cos	sin
my guess is that you might be working directly with the latitude and longitude degree values without converting them into radians which is needed by the sin and cos functions for instance

16613214
verilog	hdl
i m working with xilinx and using verilog as a hdl

16613236
folder	directory
you need to set up virtual host for apache if you have access to httpd-vhosts and link it to the subdirectory to be the root directory for all files folder under it

16613267
put	get
put the same name of radio button and get your result

16613291
accessor	properties
you need to implement get accessor for the model.revenue properties this way

16613296
mongodb	bson
so technically you can move to mongodb technically by just converting the data to json bson instead of xml while importing the data

16613298
put	get
if you want then to get a similar content you would have to put baselines on stream_a child of stream a and deliver those baselines onto the new stream

16613344
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
the problem is only in safari i tried opera mini and google-chrome and it s fine

16613352
put	get
when i put this into jsbeautifier.org i get

16613370
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox ctrl + shift + i

16613404
int	chars
sizeof int tells you how many chars s are used to represent int s

16613404
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
we can use multiplication to move our sign bit and division modulo to reduce our absolute value

16613404
addition	multiplication	addition	modulo	division	multiplication	division	addition	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
to reverse this process we perform the opposite operations in reverse of each other that is using division and modulo in place of multiplication multiplication in place of division and addition extract the sign bit and reform the value

16613435
ubuntu	linux
the application is for linux ubuntu i use python 2.7

16613466
post	get
actually i get this error on both get and post methods with some different line of jquery of course

16613482
hash	md5
generate an md5 sha1 sha256 whatever hash of the existing file

16613508
glut	glew
i m using glut and glew on windows 7 x64

16613518
installation	upgrade
the command brew upgrade git attempts to upgrade your existing homebrew installation of git but you don t have one

16613582
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
the crypt format is somewhat clever it includes the salt as the start of the crypted password in the form method salt hash

16613582
hash	salt	crypt	salt	crypt	hash
when using crypt it only looks at method salt and uses them to return method salt hash so to verify a password all you need to do is pass the crypted password as the salt and see if the result matches

16613597
put	get
it says to get their bash script and put it in your bin did it

16613645
put	get
you put something in and when you later ask for it that is exactly what you get back

16613691
width	height
now i am looking for a way to save the changed width height of the image

16613699
hide	show
i need to either show hide the field depending on what si inside of a column value in a related webpart on the same form

16613719
for-loop	loops
how about using a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

16613771
public	protected
this includes public protected default

16613779
tlistview	tlistbox
alternatively you can switch to a different windowed control that is designed for displaying lots of data such as a tlistview or tlistbox running in virtual mode

16613898
portrait	landscape
on portrait orientation but only 5 buttons are showing on the landscape orientation

16613935
post	get
so thanks to this post i was able to get it to recalculate

16613935
google-chrome	firefox
so it works in ie yay but now it s off in firefox and google-chrome

16613935
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie8 and google-chrome but alas firefox doesn t like it

16613993
put	get
the easiest solution to get utf-8 string literals is to save your perl source code with this encoding and put a use utf8

16614013
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller has it s very own navigationitem like any other uiviewcontroller that will only come into play if you push it onto the stack of another uinavigationcontroller

16614026
temp	tmp
tempfile.gettempdir does not create a temp directory - it returns your system s standand tmp directory

16614073
chown	chmod
i tried to chown and chmod 755 the folder to be sure that jenkins can access it and again it failed

16614080
int	chars
otherwise it could as well copy the value 59 which is meant to be an int as a chars since it s a value that fits in one byte

16614098
hash	md5
i like to md5 hash inputs and compare to the hash of the value looked up

16614139
getter	setter
img element doesn t have html content apart from that you are using html as setter not getter

16614150
qicon	qsettings
i tried to store qicon using class which derives from qsettings as follows

16614150
qicon	qsettings
surprisingly if i just construct an qsettings instance and save any of 69 type qicon element - it works fine

16614161
portrait	landscape
i have to resize images based on their mode portrait or landscape on the client

16614174
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
but the view controllers are subclasses of uiviewcontroller not uinavigationcontroller

16614174
portrait	landscape
now i want some of the views to support orientation portrait and landscape and some of them only support portrait

16614174
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when i change these view controllers super class from uiviewcontroller to uinavigationcontroller the view doesn t show up only a navigation bar is shown

16614199
width	height
so ideally what i d like to do is crop out just the visible portion of the page then pad the sides so that the total height and width is letter-sized

16614201
post	get
you are sending the form with post method and retrieving it with get

16614247
filtering	grouping
groupby a filtering declaring how to grouping rows formatted as an sql grouping by clause excluding the grouping by itself

16614247
filtering	grouping
having a filtering declare which row grouping to include in the cursor if row grouping is being used formatted as an sql having clause excluding the having itself

16614263
google-chrome	firefox
i am importing bookmarks to a mindmap-like app called leoeditor after exporting them into html from google-chrome or firefox

16614273
post	get
finally make sure to specify get or post in your form

16614277
google-chrome	firefox
when the script runs on firefox or google-chrome it runs fine

16614304
post	put
you have put post method in form but retrieving data from _get you should change it to _post

16614357
rss	feed
i m trying to parse a rss feed from an url that ends with .aspx

16614357
rss	feed
when i tried my own rss feed without the rss tag it worked perfectly

16614417
inherited	properties
this class inherited all properties from the parent class and will be stored in the same table as the book class

16614424
firefox	safari
update the actual page may be checked in both safari and firefox

16614424
firefox	safari
sound works in safari and the quality is much better as well but firefox is borked

16614433
centos	linux
the external system runs on a mainframe maching ibm z os while we run our process on a centos linux platform

16614461
width	height
the rows attribute specifies the height in terms of lines effectively with the line height as implied unit and the cols attribute specifies the width in terms of â œaverageâ character width a very vague concept interpreted very differently by browsers

16614490
gridview	entitydatasource
columns of two related database tables in one asp.net gridview with entitydatasource

16614506
hash	md5
to fix the problem i had the loop check to see if the file already exists and if it did just added a random string that was md5 hash following the md5 hash timestamp to make a new unique file name

16614562
flask	django
as a general purpose language python can certainly be used on the web but in order to do so one employs or creates a framework with some popular ones being django and flask

16614562
post	get
natively in the core python language there is no way to access get and post data

16614563
decoder	encoder
usually something like a des encoder decoder

16614565
post	get
i will post everything in order to get an answer

16614573
listview	gridview
i have following listview with a gridview column and cell template for that gridview column

16614645
gridview	sqldatasource
so when i start editing a row in the gridview the dropdownlist is bound which causes the sqldatasource selectcommand to execute which fires the onselecting code where i provide the parameter value from the row being edited editindex so that i get the appropriate population of values in the dropdownlist

16614649
floating-point	fractions
1 floating-point numbers have significands with linear scale also called the fractions portion not mantissas with logarithmic scales

16614649
int	chars
2 your function is declared to return an int but you attempt to return resultstring which is an array of chars

16614649
int	chars
an array of chars is not an int and cannot be automatically converted to an int

16614649
free	malloc
if you do intend to return characters from the function it should be declared so that the caller passes in an existing array of suitable size or the function dynamically allocates an array as with malloc and returns its address to the caller who is responsible for eventually deallocating it with free

16614649
int	chars
5 if the array of chars is to form a printable numeral rather than numeric bits then 0 should be added to each one to convert it from the int 0 or 1 to the chars â œ0â or â œ1â

16614664
width	height
i have specified the width and height of the image but it actually didn t expand the div container

16614664
width	height
the fix was very simple i just added the height and width for the div

16614677
spaces	delimiter
user s guide chapter 6.1.5 the word chunk a word is a string of characters delimiter by spaces tab or return characters or enclosed by double quotes

16614678
int	chars
for one thing your function declaration specifies that you are returning an int but then you return resultstring which is a chars

16614701
width	height
the source image of the photo - currently this can have a maximum width or height of 720px increasing to 960px on 1st march 2012

16614706
int	chars
so it takes the format string and stores away a pointer for the call which happens to be to a string and then takes the 2nd parameter and stores away whatever it gets according to the declaration of the function whether an int or a chars or a pointer for the call

16614706
int	double
the declaration for the 2nd and greater parameters has to be something really generic to be able to accept pointer int double and all the different types that could be there

16614710
post	get
you should use another get or better post handler that receives ajax request decodes it and broadcast to all polling connections

16614723
children	parent
a tree node may reference other tree nodes -- as children or as parent

16614745
dreamweaver	aptana
i ve been using aptana 3 for awhile now and i like it much better than dreamweaver

16614754
oncreate	setcontentview
inside of oncreate after setcontentview

16614759
udp	tcp
also i should have used recv and send instead of sendto and recvfrom like richiehindle mentioned because they are designed for udp connectionless sockets and not tcp connected sockets

16614764
symlink	realpath

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
both the uinavigationcontroller and the first uiviewcontroller work via the use of storyboards

you can show and hide views at runtime with view.setvisibility

16615075
inherited	subclassing
the typical rule-of-thumb i use for stuff like this is if there are any immutable methods in the base class that provide a common context for all your subclassing then inherited makes sense

16615103
button	checkbox
since i want to use only 1 button the array should either update after each change in the checkbox or the button should first submit the form of checkbox and then calling the javascript which is using the submitted array from above

16615151

my understanding and correct me if i m wrong is that in the new cache_digests gem cache keys for template fragments are created from a combination of an md5 hash of the template itself template dependencies and model timestamps

16615452
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on ie9 and google-chrome and firefox of course but not on ie8

gridview	detailsview
i think you should just link a detailsview to the gridview s selected index

16615499
gridview	detailsview
just handle the selectedindexchanged event of the gridview and point your detailsview s datasource at the id of the row you ve selected

16615499
gridview	detailsview	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	detailsview
or if you re using an sqldatasource for the detailsview you can just use a controlparameter pointing to the gridview

16615499
gridview	detailsview	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	detailsview
general example you have a gridview a detailsview and the detailsview is populated by a sqldatasource

16615499
gridview	sqldatasource
then you just set up your sqldatasource to have a controlparameter that is linked to the selectedvalue of the gridview

16615499
gridview	detailsview	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	detailsview
if you are not using an sqldatasource you need to handle the gridview s selectedindexchanged event and then bind the detailsview using the new selectedvalue of your gridview to the record you need using whatever databinding process you d like

16615518
int	chars
i have a bit of strange confusion happening when trying to convert my chars variables from my chars array into int

16616210
put	get
if you really want to make sure that the various string and array variables namely the filename paths documentspath and savepath don t get put into the caller s autorelease pool you could solve that problem but i m not sure how critical that is at least in comparison to the nsdata that would have been put in the pool

16616238
calloc	malloc
if however this is not the case you can although in c++ you reallly shouldn t use malloc or calloc if you need zero-initialized memory

16616263
initializer	class-method
there are some languages where traits can be attached to an object after initializer which further makes it harder to keep track of the class-method

16616273

16617297
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem

google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the reason why your code works on google-chrome is also supported in ie safari and opera is because they are always providing a global event variable but in firefox you need to pass in the event object as a parameter to the event handler

16617658
google-chrome	safari
the following works on safari both mobile and desktop and desktop google-chrome but mobile google-chrome seems to ignore it

16621897
accelerometer	gyroscope
an easy way to combine accelerometer and gyroscope data is by the use of a complementary filter

16621897
accelerometer	gyroscope
this way you don t have problems with drift from the gyroscope and noise from the accelerometer

16621897
accelerometer	gyroscope
you will thus use the gyroscope data for fast changes but on the long run you will keep following the mean value of the accelerometer angle calculation so that you don t drift

16623315
inherited	subclassing
when we create an object of any subclassing all the constructors in the corresponding inherited tree are invoked in top to bottom approach

16623315
subclass	abstract-class
though we cannot create an object of abstract-class when we create an object of a class which is concrete and subclass of the abstract-class constructor of the abstract-class is automatically invoked.hence we can have a constructor in abstract-class

when we create an object of subclassing it must take into consideration all the member functions and member variables defined in the superclass

16623493
inherited	subclassing
hence when we create a subclassing object all the constructors in the corresponding inherited tree are called in the top-bottom fashion

16623493
superclass	subclassing
now from the subclassing if we call a superclass function to print the value of this protected variable which may be initialized in the constructor of the superclass we must get the correct initialized value.hence all the superclass constructors are invoked

16623493
superclass	subclassing
so each subclassing constructor calls it s superclass constructor using super and hence they are executed in top-bottom fashion

you need to store the salt in the database together with the hash password

16632446
hash	salt
when the user tries to login you need to get the salt from the database and hash the user input with it to compare it against the hash password

16632446
hash	salt
in your example you re generating a random salt in the login procedure which will never produce the same hash as you have in your database

16632454
width	height
you can do that completely in xaml by using a togglebutton and a trigger on its ischecked property which sets the width height of all columns rows you don t want to see to 0

16632486
hash	salt
when the user registers you need to store both the salt and the hash password in your database

16632486
hash	salt
when the user tries to log in you need to use the same salt as when they registered otherwise the hash will be different

16632486
hash	salt
this will have the effect of keeping all the passwords hash in the database but is much less secure because if that salt value is compromised it s a trivial matter to brute-force the hash passwords

you can use to_csv on the dataframe you just need to specify that you want a spaces as the delimiter

16639390
post	get
when the user submits the form the browser sends the selected option value as a get or a post parameter depending on the form s action method choose

16639415
hide	show
and when looking at logcat i suspect the cause behind this message hide the keyboard initially show

16639429
folder	directory
i decided to print the working directory in the module before reading the file to see what was happening and it looks like the working directory isn t the build folder but my user home directory

16639437

switching	screens
one improvement you could make is only animate one element when switching screens

16639473
switching	screens
when doing this again with yet another screens you can do the same thing and switching the z-indexes before the animation

16639497
min	max
i know that max and min are working because i can just print each of their values out

16639539
junit	jmockit
normally in maven you would exclude the problematic transitive dependency on junit from the jmockit framework

16639539
junit	jmockit
they have included the junit dependency in the jmockit jar instead of declaring a dependency in the pom of jmockit

16639539
junit	jmockit
the new module would only depend on junit and jmockit and no source code and would have the following shade plugin conf

16639539
junit	jmockit
if you want to ensure the correct one is packaged you can still use filtering to exclude the jmockit classes and rely on the junit once

16639539
junit	jmockit
with an extra module you ensure the process is documented as pom file and you could easily switch to a newer junit or jmockit version

16639578
int	chars
as the javadoc indicates the read method reads a single chars and returns it as an int in order to be able to return -1 to indicate the end of the stream

16639578
int	chars
to print the int as a chars just cast it

16639588
maven	pom.xml
my project runs with maven 2 so i included in pom.xml that dependency too

16639588
post	put
i mean once i have the configuration i put in my last post i do on my project a maven build it displays on my screen build success then i launch tomcat and enter the url of my asp and it prints the error i gave above.

post	get
as an example read_posts view returns all post with a get add_post view adds a new post with a post

16639819

gruntjs	grunt-contrib-jshint	jslint	grunt-contrib-jshint
to expand upon my comment assuming gruntjs 0.4 and the grunt-contrib-jshint plugin you can select specific files to run jslint against

16640085
gruntjs	package.json
if the 3rd party scripts you rely upon are available via npm you could also simply include them in your package.json file and obviously leave the node_modules directory out of your gruntjs config

16640086
debian-based	linux
on debian-based linux you would install that and the python headers with edited per comment

uicollectionview	uitableview	portrait	landscape
i wish to display them using a uitableview when the device is in portrait mode and in uicollectionview when it is in landscape

16640229
children	parent
in the view controller programming guide for ios 2012-12-13 on pages 117 and 118 where they are talking about the transitions between children they remove the child view controller from the parent whenever the child s view is removed from the view hierarchy

16640238
for-loop	arrays
the answer depends on interpretation of your question initialize the unidimensional arrays p with the line i from q without using a for-loop - because your code doesn t initialize p with a line from q using a for-loop

16640238
for-loop	loops
a for-loop can be replaced by a while loops or even a recursion

16640251
src	attr
the src attr is referring to the entry class in the module by module here i mean module.gwt.xml file

16640267

win64	windows
if you want to cross-compile for windows install the mingw64-i686-gcc for win32 or mingw64-x86_64-gcc for win64 packages instead

16640571
post	put
as described in this forum post you would be better off applying the liskov substitution principle and put the logic in the actual class and then call a method shared by a superclass all these classes inherit or a protocol in obj-c if you re planning to have this logic shared across totally different classes

16640589
children	parent
i think my orange children element must cover yellow parent element and blue children element must cover orange parent element

this approach will sort the four corners based off of their min max top and left position with relation to the page

16640798
hide	show
i ve tried several things to show hide the dropdown div id machinedropdown

16640811
hide	show
depending on your application if you only ever have one copy of the form that you show and hide in your app you might just be able to make a singleton static reference

16640811
hide	show
this will only work if you only instantiate the form once however and then use show hide on it to make it dissappear or reappear as required

16640913
free	malloc
if you need the line you ll need to store the original malloc d space addresses in another set of variables so you can call free on them

16640949
free	malloc
you can use new or malloc to do this but you also have to free this memory with delete and free in that order

16640949
free	malloc
and with malloc and free

16640953
vb.net	vb6
but they couldn t it would have made it too difficult to port vb6 code to vb.net

16641024
melt	reshape
the data frame is actually initially generated by calling reshape melt on an array in which class and its associated levels are a dimension

16641054
min	max
i ll always get a value that always falls within the min max distance from orbit center 14.95 - 14.99

16641054
subtract	add
now to get the distance i should either add or subtract depending on the sign of the z coordinate

16641057
pull	push
subtree only have add pull push split merge

16641078
for-loop	arrays
then cycling through each one using a for-loop after working out the size of the arrays which was created

16641127

once deployed your web application s folder structure should be like indicates a directory

16641128
hide	show
update hide and show options doesnot work in all browsers -

16641133
subtraction	addition
looks like map iterator is a bidirectional iterator which supports increment decrement but not arithmetic addition subtraction of some int compared with random access iterator which does support the latter

16641140
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome provide a function to run a custom website in an app mode

16641184
yslow	pagespeed
however recently we noticed that the page is slower and we re getting dinged again by yslow and pagespeed for too many http requests and dns lookups

16641208
put	get
you could get a decent increase in speed by just extracting the parts of the string you need using gsub instead of splitting everything up and trying to put it back together

16641230
srp	principles
srp single responsibility principles your class should have only one well-defined responsibility

16641230
ocp	principles
ocp open-closed principles your class should be open for extension but closed for modification

16641230
lsp	principles
lsp liskov s substitution principles this one guides you to decide whether or not to use an inheritance relationship between class a and b

16641230
srp	ocp
we solved the problems with srp and isp but if you think better it still violates ocp and now violates dip

16641243
objectdatasource	formview
i am using a formview control on an asp.net page with an objectdatasource that is linked to a business tier component connected to stored procedures in the sql server

16641436
hide	show
hide one layout show new by setvisibility

16641440
width	height
but it complains error while encoder for output stream #0 0 - maybe incorrect parameters such as bit_rate rate width or height

16641460
trie	tree
i m pretty sure i could do better using a trie prefix tree but again i m just really interested in understanding the behavior of this specific code

16641472
width	height
your image has a fixed width of 440px so if you are trying to reduce the height if it you ll need to adjust it s proportions

16641520
datediff	difference
it really depends on type of time1 and time2 and what kind of difference you need to get but you can use timediff or datediff

16641577
backgrounding	multitasking
in web applications multitasking is often handled by the use of queues instead of threads with the web application queing tasks and backgrounding daemons workers doing the job

16641623
folder	directory
the directory structure starting with a folder on my desktop called site

16641662
firepath	firebug
i do have firebug and firepath installed and i still don t see anything unless i don t now where to look

16641675
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
try using setinterval and clearinterval instead of settimeout

16641682
floating-point	integer
there might be some advantage to doing integer arithmetic than floating-point arithmetic as explained below

16641682
floating-point	integer
it is not uncommon for the throughput of a processor to be the same for floating-point operations as it is for integer operations

16641682
floating-point	integer
a common situation is that a processor can complete an integer addition in one processor cycle and the processor can complete a floating-point addition in four cycles but it does the work in four parts and each part can work on a different addition at the same time as the other parts

16641682
floating-point	integer
a consequence of this is that a chain of arithmetic such as a+b+c requires eight cycles to complete in floating-point but only two cycles in integer

16641682
floating-point	integer
in contrast separate unchained arithmetic such as a+b c+d e+f and g+h effectively takes the same amount of time in floating-point or integer

16641682
floating-point	integer
this feature allows the processor to execute several arithmetic operations simultaneously often four 32-bit integer operations or four 32-bit floating-point operations sometimes more operations with narrower integers sometimes fewer operations with 64-bit floating-point

16641717
int	chars
i try to call huffmantree1.createhfmtree chars str int m int n

16641730
clang	llvm
the app crashed when the getter was invoked at objc_autorelease + 6 which seems to be a runtime clang llvm invocation

16641750
oncreate	setcontentview
finally i also manually override the oncreate method and invoke the setcontentview method

16641773
profiling	debugging
you can have multiple provisioning profiling for an app the store provisioning profiling these don t have any devices associated with them an adhoc provisioning profiling and a debugging development provisioning profiling

16641797
int	chars
if you re trying to call a function then drop the chars and the two int and maybe rename the other arguments

16641798
versioning	upgrade
consequently i get the this report was saved in a previous versioning of cr saving will upgrade the report file format dialog

16641802
post	put
now inside where it says you have to put php code to be remembered if someone post something

16641873
for-loop	arrays
then realize that arrays are 0-based in java and take a second look at your for-loop

16641879
min	max
however the number at the starting index can be any number and whether the numbers are in ascending or descending order is unknown the numbers wrap around once they hit the min max number - 0 once it reaches 9 and vice-versa

16641885
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicspixmapitem
qgraphicsscene addpixmap returns a qgraphicspixmapitem

16641915
int	boolean
most of the fields are either strings or int with a few boolean but can all be coerced into a string

16641984
tolower	toupper
again the important part is inside the switch before you call tolower or toupper you call the execute method for the value

16642021
submit	submission
that will automatically submit the form regardless of the onclick function unless you set the type on the button as described in this question how to prevent buttons from submission forms

16642025
typedef	struct
or just typedef struct listcount listc which is what i think you wanted

16642028
post	get
i can access the get methods without any problem and i obtain what i desire but when i call the post methods to send information to be processed i get bad server - http error

16642034
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
if you take a look at the code you ll see it just uses a fileinputstream wrapped with an inputstreamreader wrapped with a bufferedreader

16642063
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
in firefox they work without a hitch but in google-chrome and possibly safari it doesn t honor the media queries even though it clearly detects sees them as they are viewable in firebug however they are crossed out

16642099
post	get
after hours spent in try to get this working i ll post my solution

16642124
width	height
just for kicks an interesting alternative way to get the width 100 and the height 100 is

16642133
submit	submission
i basically want that form to generate a submit url along the lines of this when submission an entre for say

16642157
submit	submission
you need to return either true submit the form or false stop submission as necessary from the function and also use - or even better you should remove it and put on the form itself

16642181
countif	sumifs	vlookup	countif	vlookup	sumifs
bear in mind that index is the same as vlookup in that it will only return the first value if two tenders finished on the same day it will only return the first it comes across if you have more than one maybe sumifs would work better maybe along side countif to show how many there were

16642184
bottle	flask
but the other developers on my team are leaning more towards python and are looking to base the service off flask or bottle

16642259
singleton	facade
and some of javascript patterns also come to us like amd pattern singleton facade

16642295
filtering	grouping
an additional property can set the allauthorityfilter which filtering which grouping will be returned

16642303
hide	show
it works fine and creates a pdf but the problem is that after creation of pdf the scrollview is vanished from the screen and when i again load the app then it again show so i think due to pdf creation it hide any way to unhide it after creating pdf

16642305
viewdidload	viewdidappear
try to call the setregion method in viewdidappear and remove it from the viewdidload

16642334
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
the reason for that is that casting and the unary addition subtraction and multiplication the dereference operator have higher precedence than their binary counterparts

16642334
division	addition
this also explains why the problem doesn t occur with the division operator instead of the addition it doesn t have a unary counterpart

16642366
nerdtree	ctrlp
other plugins ctrlp and nerdtree are working but snipmate is not

16642368
width	height
this often affects width more than height

16642392
width	height
you can adjust height and width just for saving the day

16642419
listview	gridview
you can either use a listview or a gridview

16642454
move	drag
html on every touchmove i move the drag div

16642467
innodb	myisam
innodb tends to recover from server crashes e.g unexpected server reboots more gracefully than myisam does

16642467
innodb	myisam
the sql-level interface to innodb is identical to myisam so there s unlikely to be any reason to not convert it

16642475
post	get
the standard get and post methods used in backwards compatible website can also use these services to hit services representing business objects instead of pages

16642475
post	get
the update to a single page application then becomes simplistic in that you can initialize any ui to pick up the get or post methods and perform them using ajax methods instead of causing a postback for events thus a single page instance

16642502
folder	directory
these libraries are visible in dart packages for each newly created folder in the web directory

16642522
post	get
since the form on edit_employee_divisions.php post to itself with proper prg if the user adds the employee to multiple divisions user selects a divisions hits submit the page prgs to itself user selects another division hits submit page prgs to itself etc... then when the user wants to hit the back button to get back to the edit_employee.php page he has to hit back as many times as he has added updated removed divisions so if he adds the employee to 3 divisions he ll have to hit back 3 times before he s back at edit_employee.php

16642570
hide	show
one of the possible way kind of trick to overcome this would be to hide the scrollview controller just before pushing the new view and when you come back to this view show the scrollview again using

16642601
folder	directory
another strange thing is that the application didn t deploy into webapps directory but into wtpwebapps folder

16642609
filesystems	ntfs
this is on windows 7 using a ntfs filesystems if that helps matters

16642669
vb.net	vb6
i m actually new to bar-code and wince development and if it helps i m familiar with the following languages in-order c# vb6 vb.net c java

16642689
client-side	server-side
what you should first understand is the difference between server-side code parsing and execution a jsp page for you and client-side code parsing and execution html and javascript for you

16642689
client-side	server-side
further reading can be found on wikipedia s articles on server-side scripting and client-side scripting

16642689
client-side	server-side
a key concept to take away from the client-side scripting article about server-side scripts is

16642689
client-side	server-side
documents produced by server-side scripts may in turn contain client-side scripts

16642697
min	max
thus as the time changes over min and max values of the specified timespans for different placemarks i want also to be able to vary lookat settings

16642708
stdout	stderr
read data from stdout and stderr

16642728
folder	directory
once deployed your web application s folder structure should be like indicates a directory

16642749
google-chrome	firefox
the code is working properly in firefox and google-chrome though without any errors but in ie it s not

16642790
client-side	server-side
you might wanna take a look at some client-side scripting since server-side as in php cannot alter a page s contents once they ve been loaded

16642809
put	get
i put transform right before step definition but i still get the string instead of symbol

16642842
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
in firefox google-chrome safari last versions and explorer 8 9 10

16642854
integer	unsigned
and unsigned integer operands and sets the of and cf flags to indicate a carry overflow in the signed or unsigned result respectively

16642899
put	get
i tried the above process and my test for encryption and decryption work with the same values but when i put the two processes side by side i get values very close to one another but it doesn t seem to be working quite right

16643013
stdout	stderr
i m afraid launchd 8 does not support mailing of stdout stderr out of the box

16643026
width	height
andrew is right.but i can suggest you a work around have a empty div hidden with the same height width and position of the div .main-wrapper but with z-index more than the .main-wrapper div.initially have the empty div hidden and when user clicks on logout show the empty div there by the empty div recieves all the click events and your .main-wrapper div looks disabled

16643042
width	height
if i understand you correctly you can create a div that takes up 100 width and height with a transparent background and have it appear above the main wrapper and below the logout box

16643064
apk	dex
the java class files are converted to dex files and are packed along with the other resource you can use any file compressing software to get the contents of the apk file however to get the source code is difficult

16643088
viewdidload	viewwillappear
probably i should not answer a question of almost a year but i was having the same issue and the cause was that i was calling cllocationmanager startupdatelocation on viewdidload method when i change it to viewwillappear the issue dissapeared

16643115
iframe	prettyphoto
i need to open prettyphoto lightbox on iframe photos and now if i implement below code in iframe then it shown within iframe scope

16643200
stdout	stderr
to read combined stdout stderr as a string and to get an exception on non-zero return status

16643308
width	height
i can calculate the rectangle using width height and position but this doesn t take into account the border-radius property among others

16643308
width	height
i know that i have access to all of the individual properties that will determine the rendered outline of a node height width border-radius etc so i could in javascript reproduce the calculations the browser does

16643327
getter	setter
as oracle sql types only allow public attributes there is no point in creating getter and setter methods for them

16643342
pull	push
i have a scm that only allows http push pull poll requests

16643342
rss	feed
developers usually get notified of new code via a rss feed

16676964
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
yes if you pass an argument except null to realloc that was not obtained from a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc without having been free d since the behaviour is undefined

the pointers that may legitimately be passed to realloc are exactly the same that may be passed to free

width	height
what usually works for me is i wrap the imageview inside a relativelayout when then goes into a linearlayout making sure that height and width attributes of the relativelayout matches the linearlayout

16677298
int	double
python seems to require that any args i pass to the embedded python function be explicitly cast to one of int long double float or string using the c api

16677298
int	double
if it comes to that i may just document all parameters passed are strings so if you are actually trying to pass numbers you must cast all parameters with int float double or long

16677744
spaces	delimiter
the goal of my program is to read in a file that has a grid of numbers delimiter by white spaces

16677788

your problem is that the boxes have a border so giving them width and margin in percentages that sum to 100 don t work each box has an extra 2 pixels from the border pushing the last one off the row

16677794
put	get
i run the program input all my values etc which get put into an array in the class quest 2 and then i write them to a file

16677821
children	parent
okay the trick here was to use additional html markup to style the children and parent s separately

16677821
width	height
we add a child whose height we set and whose width will adapt automatically to the parent

16677830
min	max
linq .max and .min return the max and min respectively

for getc this works because it returns an int rather than a chars so there s extra room to return something other than a chars to signal eof

16677864
box-sizing	border-box
quoting mdn what you achive using box-sizing border-box is that

16677864
width	height
the width and height properties include the padding and border but not the margin. emphasis mine

16677874
inherited	subclassing
i m getting a very strange error with dm 1.2 and a model that is subclassing using single-table inherited sti

16677892
int	chars
the c library routines generally return an int and that int is either a chars value or an eof

16677915

the extends classes can choose which of these to implements

16678239
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has firebug and google-chrome has a developer panel available on desktop for remote debugging

16678247
gif	png
if you limit yourself to a subset of formats png jpg gif for example and implement your own header parsing code then it s possible

16678339
google-chrome	firefox
it looks and works well in ie 9 and 10 at least as far as my ie compatibility settings provide the view for ie 9 as well as the latest firefox and google-chrome but it s completely hosed in ie 8

16678339
google-chrome	firefox
also is there something quick i could do in the meantime while working on it to indicate to users they might want to switch to 9 or 10 or use firefox or google-chrome to view the site

16678395

in a subclassing i m overriding a method that is not exposed in the superclass

16678463
superclass	subclassing
however as part of the the new implementation i need to call the superclass s implementation from the subclassing s implementation

16678463
superclass	subclassing
however in my application this results in an infinite recursive loop where the subclassing s implementation is invoked every time i try to invoke the superclass s implementation

16678470
superclass	subclassing
to access the one in the superclass from within the subclassing you need to use super.name

16678492
google-chrome	firefox
my sidebar works fine on firefox but breaks out of parent in google-chrome

16678525
width	height
however as you can see in the link i am only able to create ellipses according to the width and height of the canvas area

16678558
width	height
display none will completely hide an element as if it now had a width and height of zero

16678558
width	height
visibility hidden on the other hand will hide an element but reserve a rectangle of the element s original width and height in the document

16678568
post	get
in the meantime there are quite a few blog post around on how to get pcls working unofficially - eg.

16678616

16678618
folder	dir
they are normally found in the bin folder of the default gem installation dir

16678650
superclass	subclassing
the way i ve dealt with this is to re-declare your superclass interface in your subclassing implementation file with the method you want to call from the subclassing

16678678
width	height
i can t see any way around specifying exact dimensions with equal width height for the outermost circle

16678678
box-sizing	border-box
the inner circles will be concentric with borders padding if they are set to box-sizing border-box since the border padding will be included in the dimensions

16678691
rspec	capybara
on capybara 2.1.0 with rspec 2.12.0

16678744
clang	llvm
actually the code relevant for such a change isn t a part of llvm at all but a part of its objective-c frontend called clang

16678744
clang	llvm
confusingly clang is also the name of the entire c c++ objc compiler based on both clang and llvm

16678757
put	get
when i change the code slightly i get the filtering ok but it forces me to put the query logic directly in the same method which is what i want to avoid

16678759
freebsd	opensolaris
it looks like opensolaris does this too with this definition though i don t have a copy to hand glibc freebsd don t use a macro

16678999
oncreate	setcontentview
the fragment is then loaded by the fragmentactivty when setcontentview is called oncreate

16679003
width	height
from your code i m guessing you may have pre-computed width_explosion and height_explosion from the image height width you have seen in an image editor and using the same values on different devices

16679003
post	put
i cannot post images so i have put the images here it s my blog

it delegates it via authorization filters which by default merely look at the asp.net iidentity and iprincipal

16679241
postgresql	mysql
in my earlier project we were using hibernate to abstract the underlying sql database so that we could switch from mysql to postgresql for example without changing application code

16679273
oledbcommand	sqlcommand
this means that you should use the oledb classes oledbconnection oledbcommand etc. not the classes in the sqlclient namespace sqlconnection sqlcommand etc

16679284
clang	llvm
messages such as clang llvm 1.0 error and others dot the landscape

16679292
folder	directory
this also helps if you ever split a repository or move directory around. in this case you need to ignore everything except catalog and private in the public media folder so in public media .gitignore put

16679329
macports	homebrew
your osx ships with a bsd date not gnu date so there are no gnu-style options you can install gnu date via macports or homebrew

16679340
uiview	calayer
c making a uiview setting its calayer s contents to the background image file then adding another calayer as a sublayer to the uiview s associated layer and importing an image drawn with custom core graphics code and setting the image contents as the sublayer s contents

16679351
cvs	rcs
what you are asking for is the core functionality in rcs and cvs

16679351
cvs	rcs	cvs	svn	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	rcs	bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
i would humbly suggest that you give git svn or bazaar a very serious and thorough study before you chose the archaic approaches of rcs or cvs

16679371
postgresql	mysql
i d also recommend postgresql over mysql if you are going to have nested comments as postgresql does hierarchical querying better than mysql

16679379
width	height
let the bounding box have height 2 h and width 2 w

16679379
width	height
w and h are half of the normal height and width which will make the computations below simpler

16679415
accelerometer	gyroscope
using the accelerometer and gyroscope simultaneously should give the coverage of motion necessary to divine up down left right

16679419
filtering	grouping
ok i found a way to filtering on the grouping that might work but not sure if this is the most efficient route to go

16679445
int	chars
recently we started to use either chars array to represent float in data structure protocol or int to represent float float to int by time 10000 and then divide 10000 on receiver side because of the precision

16679492
post	get
need help with my ajax to post selected option from first dropdown list to my controller then get 2nd dropdown options from new query to db model based on the posted value

16679532
postgresql	mysql
this works fine in mysql but returns no results in postgresql

16679567
folder	directory
in this case the convention is that the view is automatically found if it s in a folder in the views directory with the same name as the controller and the same name as the method

16679661
folder	directory
if the imagecache directory does not exist in your application folder create it and then make sure iis_users has modify access in the security tab of the folder s properties

16679703

i am having difficulty creating a button that will pop-up a dialog box to confirm if i want to continue to open the url link or not

16679756
google-chrome	firefox
now my question is this works in firefox and google-chrome but not ie is there a limit on how many image or better yet the size of the images ie loads

16679851
sudoers	passwd
if you don t want to enter root passwd everytime or automate that kind of task by script - learn to use sudoers

16679955
width	height
i looked for this special form of sliding buttons but all i have found were examples where a div and its content has given width and height

16679966
margin	height
by now setting a top margin on the logo negative half its height you push it up by 50 and thus align the center of the logo with the center of the banner image

16680018
implements	extends
alternatively to the indexmanager your could consider implements a custom org.hibernate.search.backend.spi.backendqueueprocessor by extends the default one org.hibernate.search.backend.impl.lucene.lucenebackendqueueprocessor

16680073
google-chrome	firefox
firefox only applies detailsviewrow the css with the image to the element so the s are left as is but google-chrome and ie apply it to each individual element so that each column has the background image

16680176
multiplying	add
if you set chane 15 4 4 0 and set totalnum 4 the result is 12 4 4 0 nan and nan is for check last value because when i 3 then chane 3 equal with 0 and chane i+1 equal to undefined and undefined multiplying to every number is nan you can fix it with change upper bound in your example set totalnum to 3 fixed it with changing to totalnum chane.length-1 or add some if

16680180
keydown	keyup
the odd part is that while it functions as intended within the keydown as you will see in the fiddle by the time it reaches keyup the value is set to the prev next option of the first last respectively

16680182
width	height
the width of my chart automatically changes but the height no longer changes anymore

16680238
mocha	node.js

16680267
serializable	deserialization
i m using jersey jax-rs with jackson for serializable deserialization to implement a set of rest services

16680293
int	double
i realize the reason for this is because if i write the c# compiler secretly inserts a cast from int to double and by using an object intermediate the compiler doesn t have enough information to do this

16680335
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic	websphere	ibm
if you want to use them you must deploy your application on a real java ee application server like jboss 7 glassfish 3 or tomee note that these are free there are others like ibm websphere and oracle weblogic that are java ee 6 application servers but you must pay in order to acquire use them

for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you need to loops through the artists arrays in a for-loop and then return the index if the value equals the artist value

16680408
freebsd	solaris
libdtrace is basically the same on all platforms that support it mac os solaris freebsd and as a result the api is very stable

16680410
for-loop	arrays
since you don t know where to begin i would say you can start going through the arrays probably using a for-loop and validating if the artist variable is equals to the current element of the arrays

16680411
int	double
i would assume this is the case here as the b.equals 2 assumes an int type is passed which is not a double

16680423
hash	md5
you can use binary instead of varbinary because the hash function will always return the same number of bytes for the same type of hash md5 sha1 etc.

16680442
folder	directory
someone on so suggested editing the scheme and setting custom working directory but the folder selection icon is disabled

16680454
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop compares each artist to each value in your arrays

16680454
for-loop	arrays
the user of a for-loop is the most common way to scroll through the contents of an arrays and compare elements against a given value

16680471
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried it in ie google-chrome and firefox

16680498
google-chrome	firefox
i dont have this problem in ie10 google-chrome or firefox

16680533
int	double
even math.floor returns a double and its result can t be coerced to an int

16680550
hide	show
i want to hide some columns and also rich them to show them in the label

16680611
min	max	range	max	range	min
in that case you could create a range min max and use random.shuffle

16680612
udp	tcp
if using udp rather then https or other tcp protocol for your project is sufficient then you may wish to take a look at dtls implementation for contiki

16680643
post	put
the requestbodybytes byte contains the bytes in the body of any post or put

16680652
folder	directory
git-tfs use its own workspace in a hidden directory of the .git folder

16680652
workitem	git-tf
ps if you are using git-tf don t install the git source control provider because you can t open a git repository in visual studio and in the same time connect on a tfs server to get builds result workitem .

16680661
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i ve tested it on google-chrome and firefox but when the code executes in safari it just ignores the save as

16680672
box-sizing	border-box
one way to do is is to use box-sizing border-box

16680700
google-chrome	firefox
the error appeared in the third test export data to localstorage and import this data without delete browser history i tested in ie10 google-chrome version 27.0.1453.93 m and firefox 21.0

16680713
hide	show
you can hide or show whatever columns you like

16680724
range	min
1 find the min date in the range or whichever date you want to start with

16680724
range	max
2 find the max date in the range or whichever date you want to end with

16680744
put	get
threads let us do the same thing we can put the parser into a thread wrapped in an active object which has some get next thing method that pulls stuff from a queue

16680799
width	height
use the left top width height rect properties to get the coordinates and dimensions of the screen s working area which is not obscured by the taskbar and other toolbars

16680834
g++	gcc
then you can compile libraries.cpp and link against the memcached libs using g++ to a libraries.o and link against that on your gcc line

16680845
vmware	virtualbox
i don t have virtualbox but opened it in vmware and it works great except that in full screen the vm stays small and in the middle

16680861
min	max
i have also coded the program to give me the min max values and the inorder traversal here is my result

16680901
rel	src
rel in the iframes src

16680905
post	get
there are generally a lot of misconceptions on how to utilize the vertical-align within css i found this post very helpful on how to get a full understanding of it.

16680983
free	malloc
first your dtrace script will give you an upper bound on the maximum memory utilization since you don t track free s as well as malloc s

16680983
free	malloc
if you do care since free doesn t take in or return the size of the free range you might be better off tracing the brk syscall return value which also accounts for the size of all metadata that malloc stores on the heap

16680983
free	malloc
the alternative to this if you want exact answers is to figure out how the data structures for malloc and free work for your os and dig into some pointer arithmetic in dtrace to get that info

16681031
rss	feed
i am working on a app that loads a feed rss and thats already done but now the app needs a section that can be updated on a simple manner.

16681033
decoder	encoder
the json encoder decoder wont use struct elements which are not exported

16681055
getter	setter
the other thing to note is that it doesn t just do the creation of an attribute getter and setter for you - it mixes in some type casting based on the type of the column

16681055
put	get
the net result of this is actually kind of a bonus and one of the reasons i like rails you define the column once in your database and you get it put into your model class for free

16681092
gdal	proj
after you successfully build gdal you need three proj settings under properties

16681134
maven	pom.xml
if you want to use it anyway maven you check maven dependency in pom.xml

16681143
subtract	add
normally when ordering by id one would think that to get the prev next entry you just need to subtract add 1 to the variable holding the id and run the select query with the new id but this poses a problem when there are holes in the table with id s like so

16681156
superclass	subclassing
by redefining x in a subclassing you re hiding the superclass field x this is true even if x refers to different variable types

16681194
hide	show
i also have a little script to show and hide a div that worked fine until i tried to make a script for the name

16681220
docx	xlsx
when i upload a docx xlsx or pptx to amazon s3 using aws .net sdk the file is getting uploaded fine and i am able to view the file directly from s3 without any issues

16681268
explode	substr
you can then use substr or explode to get it when the form is submitted

16681280
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
there is dragonfly in opera firebug in firefox devtools in google-chrome ie has ie developer tools

16681284
google-chrome	safari
but with google-chrome or safari the tooltips do not appear for points on the x axis

16681307
accessor	properties
if so would they be public members of myobjectwrappermanaged or would properties and accessor just return new instances of the hypothetical surfacemanaged class

16681326
punctuation	words
however what i don t understand is how i can efficiently maintain the correct capitalization and punctuation but ignoring punctuation within words apostrophes

16681331
width	height
if you know the size width height of the space where you want to put the words with a hole in it the picture you could generate an svg

16681392
int	double
the makes a double pointer to a function with __thiscall calling convention that takes two int arguments

16681395
children	parent
i am having an issue where the children divs are overlapping the parent box-shadow bottom

16681413
punctuation	words
if you are talking about words replacement as distinct from intra-word substring replacement i would tokenize on white-space and thereby include any punctuation as part of the tokenized words

16681449
textwrangler	textedit
i ve tried different editors textwrangler tincta etc. through appstore also standard textedit

16681490
ubuntu	debian
this works on debian ubuntu

16681563
hide	show
this approach allows you to hide show the navigation bar from the view controllers of your choice

16681590
folder	dir
skeleton of application is consisted of many files including engine reference and other references so i would not be able to include here all sources in application dir folder

16681632
background-image	box-shadow
however for ease i would advise for using a background-image or a css gradient instead of inset box-shadow

16681632
children	parent
you re also not allowed to set a background for the parent or it will hide the children

16681632
background-image	box-shadow
again you can apply box-shadow a background-image or css gradients to your shadow overlay divs

16681647
width	height
a view has a location expressed as a pair of left and top coordinates and two dimensions expressed as a width and a height

16681647
width	height
my interpretation of the above is that the view s position is controlled by its left and top values while its width and height are controlled by its width and height values

16681648
for-loop	loops
i don t know where or what you are setting take to but right before your loops you are checking if your row count is greater than take and then setting in your for-loop

16681715
android-maven-plugin	zipalign
using the built-in zipalign of the android-maven-plugin

16681715
android-maven-plugin	zipalign
simpligility android-maven-plugin with zipalign and improved verification

16681722
width	height
i want to loop through them and adjust their width and height

16681747
x86	64bit
badformatexception occurs when you attempt to load an x86 assembly in a 64bit process or vice versa

16681752
width	height
canvas es have width and height properties which you can get and set these represent the actual drawing area

16681752
width	height
using css or inline style would simply scale the drawing area similar to css width height applied to an image while the actual drawing area would be kept the same

16681752
width	height
and to get the actual area the canvas takes in the document that is computed width height taking in consideration padding and border you can use offsetheight though i believe this is not what op intended

16681770
factors	matrix
i created a dataset named state from the built-in matrix state.x77 with two continuous variables population and income and two factors variables region and area

16681793
hide	show
i use the same techniques but instead of placing a div above the actual page i would like to hide the entire page and show only the div representing the modal

16681797
children	parent
we chose to not do cascade since it is easy enough to traverse your own model and do deletes and when the other use case pops up where you just want to delete the parent entity but not children it is easier to code and not have to undo the cascade logic

16681824
min	max
as far as i know the max and min values are

16681829
children	parent
looks like you can in fact nest children inside a ccsprite and have them be a part of the batch node as long as the parent is a child of the batch node

16681841
put	get
before we get into the details of how chosenpackage is updated i put together some code that logs every time chosenpackage is updated confirming that both chosenpackage and bookingurl are being updated as expected

16681859
junit	testng
deprecated as of spring 3.1 in favor of using built-in support for declaring expected exceptions in the underlying testing framework junit testng etc.

16681859
junit	testng
again if i understand correctly the best way - to write tests so i could change for example junit onto testng

16681892
junit	testng
it doesn t let you switch between junit and testng as you seem to think

16681892
junit	testng
in that framework spring has provided expectedexception for some time but it s no longer needed because recent versions of both junit and testng provide that functionality now

16681899
cdr	cons
a cons cell holds two values typically called its car and its cdr

16681899
cdr	cons
the expression cons x y returns a cons cell whose car is x and whose cdr is y

16681899
cdr	cons
when a list is a cons cell the first element of the list is the cons cell s car and the rest of the list is the cons cell s cdr

16681910
punctuation	words
each time it runs punctuation marks are removed and the string is broken into words

16681910
punctuation	words
there may be some words which require punctuation marks such a single quote aka apostrophes at the end of a plural possessive noun or hyphenated names..

16681946
width	height
make the content width and height same of the tiles-wrapper but make it hidden and use javascript to make effect

16681989
uninstall	upgrade
for example it may not be able to upgrade or uninstall the package install other packages that depend on it etc

16682097
put	get
i exported the project to get the sha1 to put in the developer console

16682128
apache	nginx
instead you should rely on your web server the one in which bottle will run in production-- apache nginx to handle this

16682187
put	get
or else when you put the sleeps in you get more than one message at a time so you process faster

16682280
g++	gcc
on windows ghc is distributed with gcc and g++ under ghc-7.6.3 mingw bin

16682280
g++	gcc
for instance although ghc will compile .c and .cpp files using it s own gcc g++ compilers ghc also provides options to choose whichever compiler and linker you want

16682280
g++	gcc
and indeed you can specify your own gcc g++ and it seems to work

16682333
folder	directory
similar to sftp-config.json and .sublime-project workspace sort of file once you set up a .editorconfig file either in project folder or in a parent folder every time you save a file within that directory structure the plugin will automatically apply the settings in the dot file and automate a few different things for you

16682379
getter	setter
in other words always use objective-c setter getter conventions they are there for some reason

16682379
getter	setter
me in particular like to use the objecta.var somenumber syntax because it s easier to understand to other languages programmers objective-c method-calls are weird and if you don t know that objective-c creates setter getter automatically when synthesizing properties it s harder to read for them

16682382
folder	directory
i could do cvs operations once i copied the cvs folder in each directory along the path

16682382
folder	directory
i select the flat-view and find the file with path c source dir1 dir2 dir3 file.cpp i should have the cvs folder present in each of following directory dir1 dir2 and dir3

16682395
user-controls	elementhost
i created a panel on the form and in code created a new elementhost and then set the user-controls xaml file as the child in the splash screen load event

16682408
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the demo tested fine in ie10 firefox google-chrome safari and opera

16682408
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this demo also tested fine in ie10 firefox google-chrome safari and opera

16682448
firefox	safari
sometime it will happen on the first try sometimes after several and primarily in firefox 2.0 although i have had it happen once or twice in safari

16682462
width	margin
for an element that lacks a definite size with auto margins it looks like the element s fit-content width is supposed to be used as the element s actual width while the remaining space is counted as margin

16682462
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if you look at a list with the above styles opera firefox and google-chrome agree that the li elements are shrink wrapped when the direction is row

16682462
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
under the column direction only firefox and opera shrink wrap the li while google-chrome has the li take the full width of the flex container

16682516
google-chrome	firefox
first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on firefox which is a more handy tool than google-chrome s developer tool

16682521
post	get
your php file has email variable set to get while the remote validate function is set to post change one or the other to match and you should be set

16682536
faker	rspec-rails
ruby 1.9.3p429 rails 3.2.13 rspec-rails 2.13.1 capybara 2.1.0 kaminari 0.14.1 faker 1.0.1 factory_girl_rails 4.1.0

16682563
put	get
i want to get all the occurrences and then put all those values into a list

16682565
getter	setter
you can access the listpreference object at runtime and use the setter and getter methods to update the entries

16682603
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is working fine in containing an image with an overflow hidden rounded div however safari does not do a good job at this the overflow hidden doesn t seem to work here

16682605
mouse	keyboard
no one can paste now into your textbox using right button paste option of mouse or pressing ctrl+v from the keyboard

16682614
post	get
so you can pass values from php to javascript but not vice versa without ajax or a post or get method

16682626
weka	libsvm
according to the weka documentation to include libsvm in the classpath requires not using the -jar weka.jar option

16682630
post	get
i am displaying all the statuses i have already handled cases when the user enter a status to user with a corresponding text field where they can enter their milestone well when i do i post i can only get the params of the text field that was supplied duh

folder	directory
i am able to find and output all files in that sub directory but the file path that i output is incorrect ie one folder is missing

16682697
button	checkbox
my requirement is to uncheck the checkbox on a button click

16682727
for-loop	arrays
the view would contain all the surrounding divs and other html but somewhere in the view you would put a small for-loop that outputs your arrays s contents

16682753
nsdateformatter	nsformatter
parsing it with nsdateformatter can be tricky at best which is why i wrote an nsformatter subclass specifically for parsing and unparsing any iso 8601 format

16682754
width	height
your image has a different width height than the profile pic container which is why you ll see a very strange border-radius only upper left if you don t resize it

16682783
post	get
if you can simulate the button press by passing the correct parameters to the page and maybe using post instead of get if necessary then it could be fairly easy

16682809
sorting	filtering
so as mentioned in a comment below sorted sets are a great way to implement sorting and filtering functionality in cache

16682822
width	height
give height and width properties to the img elements like

16682849
free	malloc
this being c you have to manage memory for your tree nodes explicitly using malloc to allocate and free to deallocation -- or you can use an existing library that does that for you

16682876
width	height
because some pictures with have 500px width and 500px height and some will have 500px width and 400px height so i want those pictures with more height then 400px to be cropped after the resize

16682901
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

16682967
innodb	myisam
if the fk foreign key table engine is using myisam and pk primary key table engine is using innodb

16683013
min	max
from the above code looks like the random min and max values are the same i.e 1

16683027
updatepanel	formview
i have an formview inside updatepanel they are wrapped in modal dialog bootstrap

16683034
getter	setter
the mxml compiler wraps your bindable property in it s own getter setter

16683034
getter	setter
getter setter in actionscript are considered to be properties of the object they are not methods of the object

16683034
getter	setter
so it doesn t matter whether your annotate the getter or the setter as bindable the generated code does the right thing

16683045
put	get	post	get	post	put
browsers only support post and get if you need put you have to send the form via post get and then do the proper put request on server-side

16683045
post	put
but if the request is handled as a post method you couldn t stream data to the server the same way you could with put so i don t understand

16683054
button	checkbox
how check uncheck all checkbox in listview on a single button click when you are using listview with simplecursoradapter

16683081
post	get
before now in my mind both get and post are used to fetch resources from server

16683081
post	get
the only difference is post request has the payload that contains extra data but get request has no

16683111
post	get
as you can see from the pic that i attached when app android starts it will launch activity from third tab and it read user s mail address in android device then post it to server.after that server will return user_id i will save user_id in app memory.when user click on first tab which has an activity that contain a webview i will get this user_id from app memory then pass to url of webview

16683142
post	get
in the past get and post were often used to interact with resources in multiple ways

16683169
put	get
if you know you will always get three pairs of values and you want those 6 values put into 6 separate variables then you could do this

16683175
junit	testng
you cannot write a test which can run on both junit and testng so your code is bound to be dependent on testing framework

for-loop	loops
there is automatic unrolling where the compiler does the unrolling or you can unroll the code manually by simply doing say four items in each loops iteration and then stepping four items forward in each loops variable update or updating the iterator multiple times during loops itself but this of course means not using the range-based for-loop

16689898
sse	avx
auto-vectorisation - using sse mmx or avx instructions to process multiple data items in one instruction one sse instruction can add four float values to another four float in one instruction

16689898
for-loop	loops
depending on what you are trying to achieve a for-loop of whatever kind may not be the right solution in the first place or the code inside loops could perhaps use a more clever way to calculate rearrange whatever-it-does to achieve the result you need

16691477
stdout	stderr
php stdin php stdout and php stderr allow direct access to the corresponding input or output stream of the php process

as you have suggested the push pull sockets do queue jobs in memory

16692236

the class attribute in your html is spaces delimiter but you have made it period-delimited in your xpath expression

16692242

text label rect origin width and height can be inferred

16692324
post	get
the same is valid for get and post requests

trying to get values by post in your php code

16692396
width	height
i also tried to set the width and height of the hidden surface view to 0 but it doesn t work it has no effect whereas setting the size for example to 100x100 does work

16692478
portrait	landscape
but when i swap from portrait to landscape i don t get the same x value

16692488
width	height
at a very rudimentary level you can try using a full width and height iframe on your mycompany.com site and load example.com into it

16692555
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t tolerate any mistakes where as google-chrome and firefox will try and clean it up

16692587
post	put
the same code works if the page is not loaded in ajax to be sure that it will work always i simply put the form outside the table and have now data in my post

16692611
free	malloc
if you were first exposed to programming before gc became prevalent and were comfortable with malloc free and new delete then it might even be the case that you find gc a little annoying and or are distrustful as one might be distrustful of optimization which has had a checkered history. many apps tolerate random latency

16692627
width	height
the elements are also sitting within a 100 width and height background fading banner

16692657

i don t get the first line also what does it mean to put after t_num_table when move from emp_tab1 to emp_tab2 why he moves by 2 and what should this function to return

16692674
put	get
when i click in the column to put it in edit mode i get the error message

16692711
equals	gethashcode
you gethashcode implementation looks correct but your equals seems to have a problem you should only compaire the values of the compositkeys column1 and column2 nullable

16692743
setinterval	settimeout
change settimeout to setinterval and don t use relative urls

16692754
setinterval	settimeout
edit also as everyone else has pointed out use setinterval not settimeout

16692764
simpledateformat	decimalformat
when you don t explicitly specify the locale during creating the decimalformat or simpledateformat then the default locale as available by locale#getdefault will be assumed

16692764
simpledateformat	decimalformat
please also note that decimalformat is like simpledateformat not threadsafe check the synchronization section in the javadoc

16692783
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
the requirements are not that high when you think of it basically an editable grid with support for cell template and cell selection there is no sorting grouping filtering for now

16692783
listview	gridview
a listview + gridview gave good performance but there is no support for any cell-level operation selection...

16692826
unsigned	short
if you want just 2 bytes allocated use unsigned short as your data type and run the program again

16692827
pull	push
i don t want to make a new branch and commit push pull request the new branch since this must have been in the first pull-request

16692844
spaces	delimiter
with a regex i can find 2 but when i replace it regex expression basically looks for number that i want and some possible delimiter like spaces and such

16692849
implements	extends
since no one could answer my question i tried to implements the cleanest option to me extends abstractdbmapper to add the mentioned functionality

16692867
lodash	underscore.js
some libraries such as underscore.js and lodash have a clone method that you can use to create a new object and populate it with all the same properties as another

16692870
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have created browser extension add-on for google-chrome firefox safari and ie using crossrider framework

16692878
google-chrome	firefox
on the whole what i am trying to explain is that the results that i get on mozilla firefox and google-chrome are not the same

16692922
next	except
it works well except that when you click to a next step it will focus on the first visible input

16692971
tunnel	vpn
however the problem i have is if i try to connect to a database that is offline internet outage vpn tunnel down etc

16692995
pop-up	dialog
since i need to have a sending dialog and show the results on the same page ideally in a jquery pop-up i do not use the traditional html form submit

16693010
width	height
i am trying to give my container element height and width via jquery .css but my code is setting it as window height and width

16693019
unsigned	short
if optimally-packed bitfields would straddle char boundaries but not short boundaries then declaring bitfields as unsigned char would require padding to avoid such straddling

16693040
ubuntu	linux
this i am pretty sure about because you can even login as this user in the gui mode in almost all linux distributions tried for ubuntu and fedora

16693040
folder	directory
but you will not find a single directory relating to this user inside the home folder

16693053
hide	show
in jquery you can actually use show and hide function instead of adding or removing css classes

16693092
serializable	deserialization
the point is that the ideal requirements for serializable and deserialization of aggregates is that the domain model should have as little knowledge as possible about this infrastructural concern which implies the following

16693092
getter	setter
no constructors getter setter or any other piece of code just for the sake of serialization

16693106
cfstring	nsstring
if you are trying to manipulate grapheme clusters things the user might think of as â œcharactersâ you should probably make use of the nsstring methods -rangeofcomposedcharactersequencesforrange rangeofcomposedcharactersequenceatindex or the cfstring function cfstringgetrangeofcomposedcharactersatindex

16693106
cfstring	nsstring
to summarise generally speaking one should avoid examining nsstring and cfstring instances unichar by unichar

16693106
cfstring	nsstring
if at all possible use an appropriate nsstring method or cfstring function instead

16693140
put	get	post	get	post	put
get post and put works fine

16693140
put	get	post	get	post	put
get post and put methods starts with the same code

16693179
factors	mean
so from this i hope you can understand what the 2 parameters mean in the blend function first one tells what factors to use to multiply the source incoming color and the second one how to multiply the destination color

16693240
public	protected
your onclick handler is protected but it needs to be public as in the sample i showed above

16693267

you can however create your own look into or use one of the component libraries out there - tomahawk primefaces richfaces to name a few

16693282
width	height
then at some points in time access the width and height properties of these bitmapdata objects in that dictionary to calculate the total size of allocated bitmapdata

16693293
subtract	add
if you want the number closest to the original then subtract the remainder and add 12 if the remainder is greater than 6

16693309
children	parent
i may be over-simplifying things but the above should give you the parent org and the corresponding children orgs

16693309
children	parent
in order to get all the children paginated from a parent use

16693310
portrait	landscape
i ve noticed that most consumer-friendly android and iphone fitness apps have two interface modes - in portrait mode the user gets more detailed information but when the user turns the device to landscape mode a full screen graph is added to cover the entire screen

16693368
jar	war
normally it will be inside a jar that is on the classpath such as a jar in web-inf lib in your war file

16693550
submit	submission
you stop form submission by preventing default action of submit event

16693550
submit	submission
since your prompt is asynchronous you ll always have to stop normal submission and force submit with form.submit when user presses yes

16693580
comparator	comparable
the priority part in the queues you are using simply means the items are read from the queue in a specific order either natural if they implement comparable or according to a comparator

16693598
google-chrome	firefox
this code seem to work fine on google-chrome and firefox except ie7

16693656
hide	show
i have this code to show hide the div

16693658
ssl	https
the application runs over ssl and is hosted via an iframe on a page that is also setup with ssl so the user can see the https on the parent page and feel confident about entering information

16693691
mouse	keyboard
the first one is the index from imagelist for node in unselected state and the second one is applied when you select node using mouse keyboard or through code

16693709

16693744
internationalization	localization
your problem belongs in the field of website internationalization i18n and localization l10n there are also language specific challenges for arabic being a language with right-to-left script but first things first

16693770
public	protected
as suggested by devolus you have used protected access modifier for your function finisha you should use public for the same one instead of protected

16693770
implements	modifiers
where as using public access modifiers the function will be available to each class which implements an object of the class activity-a

16693776
hide	show
1 hide show the status bar

16693776
hide	show
2 hide show any uinavigationbar

16693835
min	max
the most straightforward solution looks to me to find the min date for each case and then pick the max of those two values

16693850
getter	setter
the getter and setter work just fine with integers but i cant figure this out any help would be appreciated

16693865
put	get
you need to modify the the t4 template to implement property changed notifications in such as way as you can get to the property changed method and put the total property without the notmapped attribute in your partial class

16693884
post	put
it means that the content-type http header should be set only for put and post requests

16693894
min	max
with the row_number i can group all data by id and ghet the min date and max date

16693906
implements	extends
public class login extends activity implements surfaceholder.callback

16693909
ssl	https
if you are posting those form variables over https ssl then the actual transmission will be encrypted

16693909
ssl	https
you ll be able to view them in the browser extension but the browser will have to encrypt them to send them to the server via ssl so long as the post is actually posting to https not http

16693922
terminate	timeout
but if i change the brutal_kill to an integer timeout 6000 the terminate method was never invoked

16693940
getter	setter
introducing getter and setter for obj1 and obj2 would also have the potential to create problems those would have to be synchronized on the same lock as the dosomething method and you would need locking even if fancyclass is threadsafe because if different threads are changing things then those changes need to be made visible across threads

16693945
width	height
also note that the settransform use the center of the body as anchorcenter so if you are using the gles2 branch not gles2-anchorcenter you should subtract the half of the width and height of your sprite e.g

16694019
uicollectionview	uitableview
and once the image leaves the screen you can release it the uicollectionview like the uitableview does a lot of this cleanup work for you as long as you don t maintain strong references to the images

16694098
getter	setter
is what i have because i was wanting to test and play around with the getter setter stuff for c#

16694102
passenger	thin
i tried to use thin in my development environment as my server with --threaded option with no success and now i m thinking about using phusion passenger enterprise in multithreaded mode in the production server but it s a commercial version and it does not have any trials i m afraid that it s not what i need

16694102
debian	linux
linux debian 2.6.32-5-xen-amd64

16694122
trie	tree
if you are just looking for the existence of strings then i would suggest you try using a trie also called a prefix tree

16694124
oncreate	setcontentview
so move all view initialization inside oncreate method of activity after setcontentview as

16694125
hide	show
i have a checkbox which hide show a div

16694133
getter	setter

width	margin
i am aware that images can be centered either by absolute positioning left 50 and giving a negative margin of half the image width -- or by using margin auto

16699443
width	height
to fake the element into calculating 50 from it s center simply add a margin-top and margin-left that is equal to half of that elements width and height respectively

16699501
post	get
we re using the tumblr gem to get post from our blog

16699501

width	height
in your js file you need to update the width and height of a function with the actual width and height of your object

16699526
width	height
however if you don t enter the correct width and height of your popup element it won t position itself correctly

16699534
hash	md5
secondly md5 is a very weak hash

16699584
width	margin
to center a block element it has to have a width you have that and you need to set the left and right margin to auto 0 auto

16699587
put	get
here is my xmlparser file but i can t get any node and it not put in my array

uicollectionview is a bit similar to uitableview

16700009
post	get
however to avoid deleting via get there is check if it is post request

16700009
post	get
when it comes to ajax it really does t much matter it is get or post in normal request however browser will ask you to resubmit post data when trying to refresh

16700009
post	get
using post for destructive or content changing actions was started to be recommended when browsers started to using url prefetching to get faster responses

16700009
post	get
the result of implementing url prefetching in browsers was that these applications were deleting all records when in example viewing list this is the main reason for using post over get

16700024
put	get
i make a script that get the url s and put the url s in a array

16700105
int	chars
this can be easily extended to deal with multi-character elements by changing the conditions in the while loop in getweight to append a chars to the int buffer if it is a digit and else append it to a string containing the current element name

16700130
post	get
i will try to get around to it this weekend and will be happy to post the solution if it works as expected

16700285
inherited	properties
if you need that properties to be accessible in server logic but hidden from breeze metadata you can create a dedicated metadatadbcontext that inherited from your working dbcontext and put the ignore code in there

16700303
int	boolean
also instead of passing in as a boolean int mixing data types isn t good practice maybe you should pass it as a number

16700322
ssl	https
why this is done is because when you introduce ssl onto a domain everywhere you are using http has to change to https at least for the connections that where established over https

16700351
mouse	keyboard
so the problem is that your application doesn t have focus and so doesn t get keyboard mouse input passed to it

16700367

i guess the remember me cookie timed out but gave me a generic response for trying to push or pull any code

16700476
put	get
this means that if you get a string like hello and the strings gets parsed into two separated string he and llo just llo gets put into the mutable string

16700501
post	put
you must compare the time last post was put with current time not current time with current time |

this compiles and runs without any warnings using -wall and therefore hides a dangerous implicit cast from double to int

16700604
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
firefox is not as powerful as webkit browser like google-chrome safari

16700664
int	double
after all in the execute.per.gene method the last thing i do is divide the vector by an int and the problem doesn t throw an exception at that point so therefore im must be still a vector of double at that point

16700672
dumpsys	adb
adb shell dumpsys meminfo packagename will give you native and dalvik memory usage of your app

16700706
width	height
in this case i had to re-size the image by giving appropriate width and height as the text

bad practice - class defines compareto ... and uses equals 16 days

16701047
equals	compareto
field defines compareto fielddto and uses equals

16701091

thus the virtual address space of the application keeps on increasing even if you properly call free for each malloc

16701097

16701499
for-loop	loops
i would stick with your original version that replaces the entire list with a modified version or else do a normal for-loop rather than a foreach loops

16701504
int	boolean
okay so instead of using inflate int viewgroup which will return the root layout itself instead of the inflated view use inflate int viewgroup boolean like so

the string type is capitalized because it is a class like object not a primitive type like boolean or int the other types you probably ran across

16702793
int	boolean
the other primitive types have equivalent wrapper classes like int for int and boolean for boolean

16702794
int	boolean	int	double
because string is the class java.lang.string while int double boolean etc

apache	nginx
if you re using apache and nginx i assume you re using the typical sort of reverse-proxy set up with nginx serving up static content and apache processing php--or something similar

16703161
apache	nginx
the problem is if you re serving up static content with nginx that would probably include pdfs so the apache rewrite rule is never hit--nginx serves up the pdf without bothering apache

16703239
int	double
-in java you must use explicit value types double int string etc

16703285
ienumerable	ienumerator
i m not confused with ienumerable and ienumerator

16703307
pygtk	wnck

16703459
google-chrome	firefox
i ll take any fix css js whatever to get this one finished up except static images of course you can view the same site in firefox or google-chrome to see what the finished solution should look like

16703490
put	get
work avoidance is always a good thing to consider but 1-3 more function calls to get to an event handler isn t going to put a dent in a modern jit s performance

16703529
getter	setter
the rest of the getter and setter methods remain same the id s of both parent-child tables are auto generated just take of the mappings the rest should work fine

16703536

16703679
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
there is probably an onmousedown onmouseup listener on the input s and then an onmousemove to get the mouse position while the mouse is down

addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
i think you may have intended to allocate two blocks of storage that were each n + 1 2 in size but multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction so that s not what you get

16703919
aggregate-functions	sum
it seems like you can use the following query which uses a subquery to get the total count of each distinct u_id grouped by p_id and q_id then you can apply the sum aggregate-functions to the subquery result

16703942
visualvm	jstat
first i looked at the source code of visualvm 5mb created a command-line tool that registers jvmstatmodelprovider on jvmstatmodelfactory gets an application creates jvmjvmstatmodel and extracts all monitoredvalues - it connects to a remote application via jstat and prints changed values in format timemillis name value

equals	compareto
basically findbugs is complaining about the fact that your compareto method is inconsistent with equals

16707206
equals	compareto
your compareto method should return zero only if this equals the operand

16707206
equals	compareto
overriding equals and hashcode to be in line with what your compareto method does

16707206
comparator	comparable
using a comparator rather than making this class comparable and documenting it to be inconsistent with equals

16707206
subtraction	addition
as a side remark be sure that if you return the result of an addition or subtraction for compareto that you cannot get an overflow

16707254
folder	directory
copy and past the glew-1.9.0 library folder in directory

16707264
equals	compareto
generally the value of compareto should return zero if and only if equals returns true

16707264
equals	compareto
since the default equals method uses different criteria to compare objects be sure to override equals if you override compareto

16707267
mouseup	mousedown
well you can use the mousedown event to start a function that displays the gif-frame and then add another event handler for the mouseup event that will stop that function

16707267
setinterval	clearinterval	mouseup	mousedown
that function can be called via setinterval in the mousedown -event for example and get stopped via clearinterval in the mouseup event

16707281

16707401
int	chars
chars chars ch int start int length will be called several times by the parser for the node userdetails and you have to add ch each time it is called .you can keep the element start name as a variable and set it using qname of startelement and then check the variable to make sure that chars is called several times but still the same start element

16707408
decimal	ieee
note double and float are internally represented as binary fractions according to the ieee standard 754 and can therefore not represent decimal fractions exactly

16707832
uilabel	uitextview
if you re planning to display your text in a uilabel uitextfield or uitextview and your app doesn t have to run on anything below ios 6 you can use nsattributedstring and apply a kctsuperscriptattributename attribute with the value 1

16707898
sudo	passwd
by using sudo you can have regular users perform admin tasks from their own account - usually after providing their own passwd so root passwd is never disclosed

16707907

packets	pcap
if as you seem to indicate this is a wireshark capture a capture made with wireshark not just a capture that wireshark happens to be able to read - it can read captures from programs that don t use its native pcap or pcap-ng format then the file format is pcap or pcap-ng in which case the epoch is the epoch january 1 1970 00 00 00 uts and the time stamp is either 32-bit seconds since the epoch and 32-bit microseconds since that second for pcap or a 64-bit count of units since the epoch the units are specified by the interface description block for the interface on which the packets in question was captured

16708008
packets	pcap	multiplying	add
to calculate the difference between the time stamps of two pcap packets in microseconds take the difference between the seconds values multiplying it by 1 000 000 and add to it the difference between the microseconds values both differences are signed

16708011
mouseout	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseout
unfortunately looks like tidesdk does not fire mouseout or mouseleave events on window object and i cannot detect it using mousemove because obviously mousemove events are not fired when cursor is out of the main application window

folder	directory
the root cause is that the remove directory command is not removing the folder

16708181

what you did is updating one value and than get the updated value and put it again where it has already been

16708186
portrait	landscape

subclassing ccontroller create a title properties like peterm suggested and then inherited your controllers from this controller

16708518
width	height
i want to make height of a imageview constant and based on aspect ratio width should vary

16708518
width	height
but i can see if i give width as wrap_content then height is less than fixed height because keeping aspect ratio height corresponding to wrap_content width is less fixed height

16708518
width	height
i want width to adjust keeping height exact a fix value

16708526
atoi	strtok
the main thing is that you need to run atoi pch before calling strtok again

multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	add	subtraction	add
event in case you opt that multicast delegate should also return values lets say i am having an event which is bind to 4 event handler and it takes two integers and one handler does add second subtraction and third multiplying and last divide

16708699
background-image	background-size
setting the background style twice overwrites it so only the last one will stick you ll need to use valid css properties like background-image and background-size to change them seperately

16708712
zipalign	jarsigner
so you should first bind the jarsigner execution to the package phase and in an 2nd time configure zipalign in your android plugin

16708744
width	height
for example let the divs be 200px width and height

16708781
webclient	httpwebrequest
use a httpwebrequest instead of a webclient

16708782
put	get	post	get	post	put
also since the framework is picky about the names of the rest methods get post put and delete i changed the name of the method to something else like retrieve or something

16708789
versioning	upgrade
i d upgrade to the most recent patch versioning of ruby currently 1.9.3-p429 and see whether that fixes it

16709050
innodb	myisam
also innodb does not actually do a true max but myisam does for new allocation

16709065
int	double
so apparently it favors the implicitly converted int to double over the more specific foo int from the base class

16709102
fadein	fadeout
the way the demo jsfiddle you linked to works is by calling fadeout on the parent element and when that s done calling a fadein function on that same element while also giving it new content

16709138
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu home username .android avd your avd name config.ini

16709151
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
an objectinputstream deserializes primitive data and objects previously written using an objectoutputstream

16709173
cvs	svn

16709188
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu home username .android avd you avd name config.ini

16709214

fileinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
now you can create an inputstream that reads the data from memory bytearrayinputstream or disk fileinputstream in order to upload the file

16709284
flask	cherrypy
in principle this is a proper way to serve a flask app through cherrypy just a quick note on your naming

16709284
dictionary	map
e.g. tree.flask_app_name if you re just mapping that one app in that dictionary there can be many tree directives all of them just getting merged into the paths namespace or tree.wsgi_delegates if you map many apps in that dictionary

post	get
i have one get and one post interface

16709389
entity-relationship	diagram
pre-requisite to get entity-relationship diagram entry in the context menu

16709401
int	double
the foo double i in derivedclass is hiding the foo int i from the base class so it is removed from the set

16709401
int	double
foo double i doesn t have the same signature as foo int i so it shouldn t be removed from the set

16709401
int	double
however because there is an implicit conversion from int to double it is considered to have the same signature so foo int i is removed from the set

16709428
width	height
i want to detect when a style change happens on any dom element on a page changes to any element s position height width visibility etc

16709429

16709792
backtracking	greedy
.+ is greedy so it would match till end and then backtracking if necessary

16709841
width	height
despite messing around with the fixed height before i finally found the solution by setting the div height to precisely 41.59675px and setting the width in the navmenu directly as 159px i have no idea how or why this works but it does

16709862
min	max
expr between min and max

16709862
min	max
if expr is greater than or equal to min and expr is less than or equal to max between returns 1 otherwise it returns 0

onstart	ondestroy
i see that onstart is called and ondestroy is also being called

16710148
width	height
in javascript window.open with width 500 height 500 open a new window with page size the area in which the html is displayed of 500 by 500

16710148
width	height
but the size of the whole window is larger width and height in the picture depends on theme operating system etc...

16710148
width	height
if i had the width and height of whole window i could substract from it the page size

16710266
width	height
i prefer that because you can change your div width and height use overflow etc

16710278
ant	maven
i was talking to my cousin who has worked with ee and he said to look at maven or ant

16710281
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
this is a loops doing operations on the arrays acum similar to the for-loop above

16710335
memcpy	memset
not only is it slow and leads to heap fragmentation it also can t be used with fundamental c functions like memset memcpy

16710354
for-loop	arrays
just make sure to zero-initialize the arrays contents the actually 100 portable way is with a for-loop but using calloc works on all usual platforms

16710368
selecteditem	selectedindex
i have a combobox inside my window.xaml which i initialize with it s property selectedindex having the value 0 and with it s property selecteditem having a binding to a viewmodel s property

16710368
selecteditem	selectedindex
once i start my application the combobox sets its selecteditem to ---null--- because of selectedindex 0 and futhermore mychosenitem gets also set to ---null--- since that is the combobox s selecteditem

16710419
int	chars
the returned string will be like 80 you can strip the first chars and parse it to int or just use swich case on 80 set the opacity 0.8 and so on...

16710460
put	get
my other issue is the navigation div at the top - i m trying to get that centered and i have the logo.png image put at a certain place but i m trying to make the div box 1000 pixels wide and in the center of the page with the content in there

16710460
width	height
lastly i know i m going into a lot here i have an image with a width of 100 and i d like to have content under this image but since the width varies depending on their resolution so does the height so putting a fixed number in for where to position the content is impossible since it will be different for various resolutions

16710468
width	height
but it will show differently in the other resolution and if i change the width or height into 100

16710481
post	get
you defined method action as post but you retrieve it as get you can use also _request to get variables from both post get request

16710481
post	get
the variables in _request are provided to the script via the get post and cookie input mechanisms and therefore could be modified by the remote user and cannot be trusted

16710519
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the major issue with the site is the site comes perfectly in google-chrome opera ie but in firefox and safari the jquery css sliding menu is not coming properly

16710561

as a side note i also put a breakpoint in the __dopostback method generated by .net and it does get hit after showconfirm returns false

16710580
cout	cin
you can put the function implementation into a source file and then when you use cout and cin which need the standard namespace you won t need the using in the header

16710591
width	height
it was drawn on coreldrawx6 and exported to a .jpg image meaning i can t set the height and width exactly right when exporting

i ve write an automated application in vb6 and also in vb.net that opens an html documents for printing

16710631
google-chrome	firefox
however data is binding in ie8 browser correctly but not binding in google-chrome firefox browsers

16710642
children	parent
so no need to set same clip-path to parent as well as children group

16710643
selecteditem	selectedindex
you don t need the selectedindex anymore since your initial twoway binding to mychosenitem will update the selecteditem to be ---null--

16710657
maven	pom.xml
if you are running a maven project change the javax.servlet-api dependency to scope provided in you pom.xml since the container already provided the servlet jar in itself

if the edges have weights dijkstra s algorithm and bellman-ford algoriths are things which you should be looking at depending on your expected time and space complexities that you are looking at

16710811
hide	show
i used a similar technique to update a button in a uitoolbar when a uiwebview is reloading as it doesn t appear to be possible to show hide individual bar button items

16710845
setinterval	clearinterval
each time the setinterval will create a new timer so when you clearinterval you have to clear all the timer maybe some of them you created.see this blow

16710890
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not on ie.in ie the call itself is not getting triggered .what should i do to make it work...and requirement is to make call with post

16710899

the root view controller of navigation controller supports only portrait orientation and other controllers supports all orientation.now if i am on the root view controller and the devices is in landscape and if i push next view controller that opens in portrait that should open in landscape as it supports all orientation

16710939
getter	setter
with a getter which will do the work your converter does and a setter a bit more complicated

16710966
children	parent
this information i repeat doesn t have to do with the business logic but with some activerecord information which is hidden inside the collection association like knowing which class are the children name of association in parent and so on

16710969
folder	directory
by default symfony tries to scan every bundle directory for a folder called command and searches for console command classes in there

16710989

in ant here s what i use to delete a folder with my build directory called uncompressed

16711156
bash	tcsh
you use csh or tcsh instead of bash and the somewhat irrational behaviour that you just discovered is one of the reasons not to use csh for programming

16711156
bash	zsh
use bash ksh dash zsh or plain old sh

16711177
versioning	upgrade
well since i upgrade my symfony to 2.2 versioning something happened with fosuserbundle

16711178
bids	ssis
of you can use a 3rd party tool bids helper to visualize the ssis performance

16711211
sortedmap	sortedset
besides you can try using toolkit from terracotta which provides clustered ds like map set sortedmap sortedset etc

16711274
wordpress	joomla
this sounds like server-side malware i bet it s a joomla or wordpress site

16711293

so i tried to write my code in eclipse i am using linux ubuntu 12.04

16711788
min	max
by clause or put inside aggregate functions min max avg count etc.

16711788
min	max
from all aggregate functions only min and max suit our purpose because they do not change the type of the column they are applied to

16711788
min	max
as for product - you can use both min or max - i can see no difference in your current example

16711812
cpu	processors
there s no guarantee because after all you might execute this on a machine with only one physical processors or maybe it s under heavy load and only has 10 cpu left anyway

16711823
subtract	add

width	height
but it s not straightforward to get the height of the text element to scale with it s width because the browser doesn t consider the background image as part of the content

16721583
width	height
i understand that any of the common image replacement techniques could be easily combined with media queries to incrementally change the size of the text element to specific height x width ratios that work

16721595
post	get
if you want a neat fix to your dilemma consider implementing something to get the session id out of a get post parameter or out of a header i usually do it using the authorization header personally

also the form uses the get method so it would be easier for you to put the keyword to the requested url in the query string

16722762
hide	show
you can use visibility attribute of the controls to hide or show them

16722764
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you should call setcontentview before calling findviewbyid

16722764

my personal preference is to call setcontentview immediately after super.oncreate so that i know the rest of the oncreate method is less likely to break

16722805
draggable	droppable
however i d like the droppable to react on attempt to drop incorrect draggable on them

16722805
draggable	droppable
i ve no idea how to do it because all droppable events are fired only when something is done to accepted draggable not to unaccepted one

draggable	droppable
theoretically i could make the droppable accept both draggable then change the color on drop event

my initial thought is there will be some logic that puts the rows converted to objects in a collection like a list and the list has an event that gets fired when an item is added

16723085
dbcontext	objectcontext
your concern is valid and you must use an that ultimately goes back to a or of your entity framework dbcontext or objectcontext in order to ensure that you query the user actually in the database and not in memory after you have loaded thousands of them

16723085
dbcontext	objectcontext
basically the same linq but with context instance of your derived dbcontext or objectcontext instead of applicationconfig

16723245
put	get
the success and error callbacks are just specialized promise resolvers so you can just put whatever code you want to run directly in those callbacks as those callbacks only get called when the promise gets resolved

16723720
width	height
with the transition set for all properties the inner div was still growing from 0 towards its final width and height

16723778

folder	directory
alternatively use the finder preferences under the finder menu just to the right of your apple menu to add your home directory to the list of folder at the left top of your finder windows

if the number you want to square is an int pow will involve converting it to double then converting the result back to an int type which is relatively expensive and could cause subtle rounding errors

16723962

if an article s too big put it in 2 rows as long as you query by partition key you ll get both rows then use the row key as the index indicating how the articles fit back together

16724074

16724120
int	double
shortestval needs to be declared int not double

16724165
velocity	xwiki
you can check how xwiki does this it uses a configurable filter to pre-process the velocity code to remove white space and perhaps the indent filter is the one that suits your needs

16724206
keystore	jks
if you re not using the jce then you would use jks keystore

16724214

16724656
google-chrome	firefox
i works in ie google-chrome and firefox

16724673
hide	show
the basic principle would be to render all columns so they are all emitted in the html set hidden to false on all columns and then use media queries in the css to show hide the appropriate columns based on the viewport width

16724679
int	chars
lucus suggestion of void printarray chars array 50 int size works except that it is not generic in that your size parameter must be 50

16724964
rss	feed
now i only needed to tweak your solution to put the rss feed to the current http request in the .ashx handler that i was using it in

16724964
post	put
this fix stopped working in some newer asp.net version or something due to the code of the rss20feedformatter changing to what you put in your post

16724985
width	height
when the box height of your #mylog element is overflowed your overflow auto declaration will in force the browser to generate a vertical scrollbar which will use some pixels of the available width

16724996
free	memcpy
if that data is limited in scope i.e will get free during the lifetime of your use of time then you need to copy the bytes from data to a time_t struct rather than just pointing to memory that may be freeed as eric suggests using a memcpy

16725030
noexcept	throw
that means the functions that take by-value and move out of their argument can often be noexcept moving any throw s out of their body and into the calling scope who can avoid it via direct construction sometimes or construct the items and move into the argument to control where throw happens

16725048
hide	show
so i guess in the settimeout i have to check if the current ajax is already done if it is then do not bother to show the panel else show it and ajaxcomplete will hide it later

16725066
width	height
so according to the structure of chunks you first have to read the four bytes representing the length of the chunk s data field then the four bytes representing the chunk s name then the two 32-bit integers representing width and height eight bytes in total

16725066
width	height
so the exact minimal number of bytes you must read in order to determine width and height is 8 + 4 + 4 + 8 24 bytes

16725066
width	height
width and height can be accessed as big-endian encoded unsigned ints at offset 24 minus 8 and minus 4 bytes respectively

16727812
hide	show
i wasn t sure if i just needed to have my row template be able to show hide my button links based on hover over or if kendo grids had something out of the box that would make this easier

16727927
folder	directory
note that forfiles has a limitation that it can t take a path with spaces so if you have a path with spaces you will have to change to that directory first see forfiles - spaces in folder path

16727933
google-chrome	firefox
it should not be a huge problem as firefox and google-chrome marks you elements within page as you go through html code in developer tools element tab

16727963
for-loop	arrays
i debug each arrays element during the for-loop and it seems fine coz i see all 10 elements

16728002
uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller
if you created your own several options would work to display it at the depth you wanted but i would recommend creating an overlay a view on top of the uipageviewcontroller and adding the uipagecontrol to that so the two are completely independent

16728002
uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller
to track page changes implement the uipageviewcontrollerdelegate of uipageviewcontroller and forward the view controller changes to your uipagecontrol using setcurrentpage and setnumberofpages

16728008
charts	bar-chart
what i would like to do is superimpose the raw jittered data to produce a bar-chart version of this box plot i realise that a box plot would probably be better but my hands are tied because the client is pathologically attached to bar charts

you can add a uigesturerecognizer uipangesturerecognizer among them to any view handle the action from any other object using the gesture s

16728356
width	height
the key is to use padding percentage to set the height because padding-top and padding-bottom percentage is linked to container width unlike height which is linked to container height

16728356
width	height
where padding-top is calculated by dividing the image height by width

16728399
width	height
when you provide a width and height for the div in it resizes according to the page size

16728399
width	height
and the image size in is relative to the div width and height

16728399
width	height
i have kept the div height at 90 of the available space and width at 50

16728399

i had some issues with spring bean that had to implements interface and extends some base class in the past

16728476
implements	extends
thing like whether class implements interface whether class extends class and combinations matter here

16728476

update answering your question in one sentence you probably do not want to extends abstract class and implements interface at the same time in the code that deals with dynamic class proxying aop code generation

i m open to using javascript but it needs to be able to do multiple headers without knowing the height and width of either the fixed headers or the other rows and also needs to be able to squeeze into a div that can scroll horiz and vertically

16729027
implements	extends
one anti-pattern that comes to mind is where constants as public static final variables are put on either an abstract class and an interface and then the users of these constants implements the interface or extends the abstract class

16729146
textview	listactivity
but activity_main when it includes a textview was working mainactivity being extended from activity instead of listactivity

width	margin
so the top margin that you have specified is 42 of the width of the block that is containing your #navigation div in this case the body

16736233

i admit i don t fully understand what impact setting the transferencodingchunked property has but it seems strange to me that in order to make the proxy work as expected i need to set this property to false when clearly the incoming response has a transfer-encoding chunked header

16736254
crypt	hash
in other words the first part of the resulting hash is the same as the original input into the crypt function

16736254

16736751
free	malloc
i keep getting crashes either an internal assertion failure or sometimes even more weird a malloc error incorrect checksum for free object.

16736752
mouseup	mouseleave
you may want to bind the mouseup mouseleave inside the settimeout to save yourself from having to have to deal with a global variable

16736759
width	height
your only real bet would be to grab the image dimensions at the back-end and pass the width height attributes into the tag like this

16736771

one is taking data from an outputstream and converting it to an inputstream

16736790

maven	pom.xml
to create a pom.xml manually is not a good point if you use ide - just create a new maven project for example in idea or eclipse

hammer.js	fastclick.js
hammer.js is a more full-featured touch library has many swipe commands than fastclick.js most upvoted answer

hide	show
jquery hide show set the display property directly on the element

16737176

if it s important to you to set the display with jquery but you don t want to show the element at widths below 480px then you ll need to use some conditional logic to either show or hide as appropriate

16737197

this works fine for accelerometer readings but it turned out that some sensors reported their default value in this first reading such as far for the proximity sensor or 0.0 0.0 0.0 for the gyroscope

16737200
versioning	upgrade
have you always stuck with the same versioning or recently upgrade

16737207
hide	show
if i hide the select and show it when the modal is closed it works but it seems a really ugly workaround

16737241
hide	show
what we need to do is first show the progress indicator as soon as we are able to and then when the page is fully loaded hide it

16737341
hide	show
because .fadeout is to hide the message unless you show it again inside the function buscaposto

16737357
pop-up	dialog
in a list of products i would like to open a pop-up jquery dialog in wich a partial view can be opened

that s how you d do things like pop-up a save dialog

16737429

hope that helps - its not a solution but i m pretty sure from the research i ve done that the slideup slidedown code is fine its a browser bug.

16737519

16737645
d3.js	highcharts
ideally in highcharts but d3.js or something else is possible

16737665
onkeyup	onfocus	onchange	onkeyup	onchange	onfocus
your problem is that you start with a text field and then convert that to a password field when a user starts typing in it i m guessing using something like onkeyup or onchange change the trigger to onfocus instead which should resolve your problem

width	height
edit it does not overflow the parents width or height only the border-radius until you scroll then it fixes itself

16737846
folder	directory
i started by making it act on and directory because in my case the user should be able to perform this action on any combination of files and folder

16737853
d3.js	raphael
my current client uses ie7 exclusively which raphael works with perfectly and d3.js does not

16737901
free	malloc
if you malloc a section of memory the pointers live on the heap and will not disappear or become unusable until free is called on that pointer

16737901
free	malloc
in short your last sentence is correct if you use malloc the memory will be allocated on the heap until you call free

16737920
super	extends
i would be fine with just extends it the ugly javascript way but that then it will still complain about not know it s super methods

16737945
folder	directory
the config files are installed to application directory in program files but they are copied to app data folder as soon as any change is made to config file at run time

16737970
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the details of how to obtain the call stack are vendor specific e.stack in firefox e.message in opera sketchy function body parsing in ie and safari but a reasonably robust implementation exists on eriwen.com

16738060
getter	setter
i recommend either adding a public buttonid property to your battleactionbutton or a private property with a buttonid getter setter

16738205
fadein	fadeout
the fix that finally worked was using the callback function to trigger the fadein only when the fadeout completed

16738213
cells	tablecell
findcontrol is not recursive and you have a number of tablecell controls in the cells property on your gridviewrow before you get to the level where your control is so changing it to something like this will work

16738274
width	margin
well it gives you the width padding and margin that you want without needing to write more code

16738316
fish	bash

scatter	graphing
how can limit the x length of the graphing and update the colour of the scatter points

16738729
int	double
note that if you are actually computing fractions and the numerator and denominator are int you need to cast one of them to double first otherwise the division operator will produce an int that is rounded down and that if you want the result to be an int you need to cast the result of round

16743413
dmz	was
but there are a apache as a dmz and only someservice was externalized so when i call someservice via dmz its try to call rather then

16743423
gif	png
so the extension for the image would be either png jpg or gif

16743425
client-side	server-side
here s how you would add the elements directly on the server-side instead of emitting javascript that then adds the elements on the client-side

16743426
temp	tmp
earlier today i refined it to run on a couple of ibooks placing a temp file into a local directory rather than writing to tmp

16743437
freebsd	linux
it can run on several web servers such as apache or iis on top of many operating systems among them linux microsoft windows freebsd mac os x and os 2

16743532
width	height
i ve found several article tried difference width height and weight layout but nothing seems to work

16743534
getter	setter
better practice is using setter getter

16743536
getter	setter
or you could keep the members private and offer a protected setter possibly also a protected getter

16743555
pop-up	dialog
dialog won t pop-up after 10s

16743563
hash	salt
the purpose of a salt is to make it difficult to match the hash

16743593
textarea	pre
if you are displaying it in another container not a textarea you can add the white-space pre rule to it or just use tags to have it display whitespace as-is

16743611
hide	show
i am using the following script on a button to toggle show and hide the main menu based on the current page

16743657
getter	setter
you can get and set their values by getter and setter methods which will be public

16743699
centos	linux
i m able to mount the shares on the linux box centos 6.4 using in fstab

16743716
int	double
i think your radius is shrinking each time through the while loop due to the casting of double to int

16743726
int	chars
if i treat input chars as int then result is -41 because after first loop 0 is -44 and 1 is 0 then 1 becomes 3 and we add that 3 to -44 so it results in -41

16743728
identifier	ambiguous
i also learned that there is an explicit way to tell ocamldoc to which syntactic category the mentioned identifier belong i suppose to help in some ambiguous case

16743750
int	chars
string string chars int int string string int string string int

16743777
pop-up	dialog
and you should see a dialog pop-up with some options displayed

16743789
versioning	upgrade
now i tried reinstalling the sdk tools via the sdk manager and i got the upgrade versioning

16743791
ord	chr
you can use ord to get the ascii value of each character and chr to convert it back

16743806
super	abstract
second the super class userdetail is concrete but the intermediate derived class userbelongstoapartmentcomplex is abstract

16743812
post	get
it would seem that the only difference is that main controller action not the partial that populates the big view model is at first reached via a get and then fails when reached via a post

16743837
partition-problem	np-complete
this is called partition-problem and it is known to be np-complete

16743859
int	chars
i suspect that the castle chars does not fit in a single chars but rather requires an int code point

16743859
int	chars
so my guess would be that that chars requires more than 16 bits so it would need to be treated as an int code point

16743870
width	height
note that both the width and height of the image need to be even for a 2x2 submatrix to work as intended.

16743872
xsl-fo	xslt
i am new to xsl-fo and have a very basic question the following are xslt and xml files

16743934
hide	show
the user would navigate through the form using javascript to show hide appropriate content

16743999
qthread	qwidget
i have problem that qthread finished is not always emitted or qwidget close is not always invoked for some reasons

16744054
apache-poi	docx4j
docx4j has apache-poi as a dependency and apache-poi has reasonable support for the legacy binary doc format hwpf

16744054
xwpf	hwpf	apache-poi	docx4j
this assertion stands whether you were doing docx4j to binary doc hwpf or apache-poi s own xwpf to hwpf since apache-poi doesn t have a common interface across the two of them

16744054
docx	.doc
so instead of using poi for this i d use jodconverter to drive libreoffice or openoffice their docx features are a bit different to convert docx to legacy binary .doc

16744054
apache-poi	docx4j
the downside with it is that if you find something which isn t supported properly you ll have to wait for the lo oo guys to fix it which wouldn t be the case if you did decide to build binary doc output for docx4j using apache-poi

16744074
free	malloc
inside the library i never called malloc free directly

16744092
google-chrome	firefox
as i understand it the v8 engine in google-chrome has been using assembly level optimisations for some time and now the at the time of writing upcoming release of odinmonkey on firefox indicates that extensive low-level optimisations are being written into browsers for javascript

16744102
centos	linux
looking at a couple of our production servers running centos linux and comparing proc ... fd to that counter shows that it is either spot on or very close

16744116
subtract	add
if you enter b+ or b- it will take subtract .3 or add .3 respectively so b+ would be 3.3

16744122
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i m using the apache2 server and have i think set up authentication and authorization through configuring httpd.conf and .htaccess but i am now getting a 500 internal server error

16744177
for-loop	loops
note that with macros it s probably possible to detect say iteration over a range purely as a simple c style for-loop and transform that into a while loops or a direct tailrecursive inner function without having to change the spec or add special casing to the compiler

16744183
sum	floor
since the sum of the rooms on the floor does not equal the total of the floor it s not as simple as summing the rooms up twice

16744225
subtract	add
and yes you should add subtract your + and - modification after you set your letter value

16744240
width	height
you get the same effect by using inline-block but setting width and height instead of using padding

16744246
width	height
you have to specify a width and height to show the background

16744288
width	height
to achieve what you want you need a little css to define a height and width for the span but you also need to make it a block element so that it is rendered consistently

16744300
post	get
i managed to work get custom request but it fails with post

16744323
folder	directory
if a folder called heartbeat doesn t exist then the ping command itself would throw an error saying heartbeat no such file or directory

16744325
width	height	portrait	landscape
it will use the greatest height and the greatest width between both landscape and portrait modes

16744371
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
the server obviously performs a lot of malloc realloc free operations which are expensive so i was wondering if i should use a custom memory allocator maybe something which preallocates a big memory pool at the beginning and then using it to give free pieces of the requested size when a malloc realloc is performed and flagging them as free when a free is called

16744401
vmware	esx
vmware esx 3.5

16744406
arraylist	treeset
you re trying to add a string to a treeset of arraylist of string s

16744418
x86	64bit
on gcc generating code for x86 long double is a 80-bit double-extended ieee 754 format whereas visual studio c++ treats long double like a 64bit double-precision ieee 754 format

16744419
sqoop	hadoop
so my opinion on sqoop s dependencies is that it s just some magic bundle of jars that is enough to build sqoop from sources and works with particular version of hadoop that this bundle of sqoop is supposed to work with

16744419
sqoop	hadoop
it means that both hadoop and sqoop jars with be in the classpath so dependencies can conflict depending on what is in hadoop s classpath already

16744456
entities	entitymanager
the orm will manage an in-memory projection state of your database as java entities the collection of managed entity is managed by an object entitymanager or session in hibernate

16744519
google-chrome	firefox
i haven t tested it on ie but it works great on google-chrome and firefox

16744529
post	get
b this is all the specification requires when doing most get or post requests

16744529
put	preflight	post	put
drawbacks -- a the specification states that any patch put or delete requests along with post requests that use a content-type other than form-data url-encoded or text plain need to be preflight

16744555
maya	blender
many animation tools maya cinema4d blender etc. are able to utilize this format

16744603
vim	emacs
you can then use notepad or emacs or vim or w e text editor you want and follow along with the ide tutorials. but i agree with most people here you might as well use an ide

16744643
google-chrome	firefox
to op this will not work in google-chrome however it does work in firefox and other browsers i have just tested it and it works o.k

16744656
stdout	stderr
however it doesn t suppress output on stderr only on stdout

16744656
stdout	stderr
if you want to suppress output on stderr as well you have to redirect that file descriptor to stdout before piping the output into out-null

16744657
portrait	landscape
it looks good on my htc one x and iphone 5 but on the iphone 4 there is a weird margin padding that is being added whenever the user shifts from landscape to portrait

16744673
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i tested in all this web browsers firefox 21 google-chrome 27 safari 5 and i only get the starting message

16744676
qstring	qfile
use qfile readall pass it to qstring in constructor split it to qstringlist iterate through it with toint function

16744717
hide	show
the list has the right size after my show hide method but the first item mainlist .get 0 is allways visible and i think it covered the right item

16744774
libs	buildpath
it was rather silly of me in order and export panel of buildpath configuration i had android dependencies ticked but android provite libs unticked

16744800
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works well in safari and google-chrome but in firefox a strange thing happens

16744808
apache	nginx
if you want to run node.js directly without any supporting web server or reverse proxy no nginx varnish apache etc you need to listen on port 80 for http and optionally 443 for https if you want normal urls to work

16744855
execl	fork
you should be using either fork followed by execl or preferably posix_spawn

16745027
lan	localhost
this does not happen when a request is made from the lan or localhost and the page is served over https as required

16745028
margin	height
when doing this remember height is the size of the element less the margin padding and border so if you want a total height of 30px make sure to subtract 1px from the top and 1px from the bottom giving you a css height of 28px

16745071
octal	binary
you can also use octal 0o404 or in python 2 only 0404 or binary 0b100000100 notation to specify the same integer value

16745083
rss	feed
i m trying to skip over rss feed that have not been modified using feedparser and etags

16745083
rss	feed
my understanding is that when the rss feed gets updated the etag changes and if they match then i should get a 304

16745085
bmp	png	gif	bmp	gif	png
when i said that i mean for the standard image formats like gif jpeg bmp png and so on

16745093
tilemill	mapnik
i can render larger files like all us counties and i can render the file using mapnik or tilemill

16745104
width	height
main scene have to set width to 960px 1280px and height to 540px 720px through css stylesheets

16745130
rss	feed
instead run the rss parser in a separate application or at least a separate thread and store the retrieved feed in a database table for rapid access

16745133
folder	directory
i tried to change the directory in the properties to ... platform-tools but it gave me the message could not find folder tools in .

16745189
width	height
i need to increment the x and y variables up to their image width and height respectively

16745191
mouseleave	mouseenter
it is set to make the image grayscale then on mouseenter it does an animation into the original image then on mouseleave it goes back to grayscale

16745191
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve made it so it fades out slowly into grayscale on mouseleave but afterwards it won t do the mouseenter animation anymore

16745192
width	font-size
i realised the solution didn t play well in any version of ie this updated version fixes that by rendering the bullet point inside the pseudo element and it then set the font-size line-height and width on the pseudo element to get it to look good and line things up it works in ie8+ and all other browsers

16745230
google-chrome	firefox
everything was working fine the images loaded visually as expected except that the error kept showing up in firefox error console - no such errors in ie or google-chrome though

16745236
width	margin
i want to create a box with a 90 width of the screen for example and then add 3 other boxes inside the main box but centered horizontally with percentage margin because i want always centered on mobile versions of the website

16745257
geocoding	geocode
i am trying to implement a geocoding feature in my app but i am getting a stack level too deep error for the following method in the model i want to geocode

16745272
salt	md5	crypt	salt	crypt	md5
if crypt is executed with md5 salt the return value conists of the salt only

16745272
hash	salt
thus by ensuring the salt itself is not returned it avoids a feedback cycle where stored hash - just the salt from due to the bug - would always register as being valid for any password

16745335
gson	jackson
that s json you can use a library like jackson r gson to deserialize it

16745341
post	get
but can t get it to post to a product category

16745445
width	height
to do that it defines width and height as 100

16745491
mouse	keyboard
however if i bring the screen back on by moving the mouse or pressing the keyboard my app shows the clock value when the screen went off say 2 01pm while the current time might be 3 30pm

16745497
fadein	fadeout
basically i only want the text from the #information div to fadeout and fadein the new text from the other div-wrap

16745527
xslt	xquery
saxon ce a javascript implementation of the popular xslt has documentation that indicates saxon-ce has had xquery support removed

16745527
xslt	xquery
as a beginner with xslt xpath xquery in general and mostly recently saxon-ce i m confused

16745577
xslt	xquery
xslt 2.0 and xquery 1.0 utilize xpath 2.0 which is what you are recognizing as xquery in the code above

16745577
xslt	xquery
the above code is xslt 2.0 not xquery

16745577
xslt	xquery
saxon-ce does not support xquery but by supporting xslt 2.0 it inherently supports xpath 2.0

16745593
multiplying	division
does it worth it to create new methods for such simple functions like multiplying division and so on

16745599
keydown	keyup
here s a simple example of what you can do in order to listen to several keys at the same time using the keyup and keydown events instead

16745651
folder	directory
within the node_modules folder i have create a symlink to the directory where my module under test is

16745652
viewmodel	caliburn
if you are using caliburn micro you can effectively remove .xaml.cs the framework takes care of initialization if you are going with the viewmodel approach

16745712
junit	testng
unlike other testing frameworks such as testng junit doesn t provide the ability to make your own report generator

16745712
junit	testng
testng however can be used to run junit tests and even produces a junit report in addition to its own reports

16745712
junit	testng
testng can run your junit tests and then create custom reports by providing a custom implementation of the org.testng.ireporter interface

16745715
onresume	onpause
so provided your enable and disable calls reside between the onresume and onpause callbacks in the activity lifecycle you can call them whenever

16745730
post	put
i m using postman to test the functionality and sending raw json over put or post to example.com areas 1.json returns a message telling me that the data couldn t be saved

16745742
google-chrome	safari
it works just fine in google-chrome safari using their -webkit-mask property

16745742
width	height
i ve had some success with firefox and mask if i specify the width and height of the masking rect in absolute pixels but not as 100

16745790
put	get
it seems to get multiple to work you need to use and then put the full path in sun-jaxws.xml

16745801
thin	webrick
looks like you are using webrick i am pretty sure you should be using thin for heroku

16745821
nsstring	nsdata
however you can do a similar thing one level up you can create the nsdata and nsstring without copying your data itself to the heap

16745821
nsstring	nsdata
this still wraps your data as heap objects but doesn t both the nsdata and nsstring heap objects directly reference your data

16745836
width	height
it is easy to miss the implication of this gridbag determines the width of a column and the height of a row by using the preferred sizes of all the components in that column row

16745836
width	height
the code below attempts to treat the gridbaglayout panel as a grid with columns and rows determined by the x y width and height attributes of the components within the panel and gbl evidently ignores that

16745838
box-sizing	border-box
with box-sizing border-box they are essentially fighting for the same real estate

16745868
filtering	grouping
i m trying to put this into the callback function like the grouping function so that the values will be summed after each table filtering too

16745890
pop-up	dialog
i see the developer warning in my pop-up auth dialog that are 275 tall by 875 wide

16745910
google-chrome	firefox
i d like to be able to group tabs in google-chrome on windows vista 7 primarily as i can with tab mix plus on firefox so that i only see one group in the tab list at one time

16745910
google-chrome	firefox
i ve not coded a google-chrome extension before but i think the specific problem is that you can t control the visibility of tabs in the way you can with the hidden attribute of tabs in firefox or windows from a google-chrome extension

16745939
getter	setter
you could do this in the getter or the setter or the constructors depending on exactly how the objects are materialized from the database

16745993
put	get
hi i have a global variable usuario and i want to put it a value that i get from the .post function but doesnt work

16746006
pop-up	dialog
that code works but it pop-up a dialog box which asks for the file name and and save location

16746008
put	get
you can put the if and else block inside the callback or create other function and call it in your callback to to get the usuario variable correctly with the value expected

16746037
neo4j	titan
or you can go with another blueprints implementation like neo4j and titan which can handle larger datasets

16746061
min	max
if the variable placeholder a1 acted as parameter of listed formula max min sum and avg it should replaced by 1.1 convert a to 1 and concatenate with dot and if it outside the formula bracket it should kept remain and will be replaced later if you could help build jison file that make the max accept string that would be great

16746085
range	max
adding to sammy answer if the original range color is -min max and you want to perform histogram equalization and display the depth color the code should be like below

16746173
mathml	mathjax
i know the default way to render the mathml to html is placing the mathml code inside and script tag then use mathjax to typeset the elements containing the script tags

16746173
mathml	mathjax
so when the mathjax typesetting the html elements containing the tags the mathml can be rendered to the html without using any script tags

16746375
tablet	galaxy
let me clarify testing is on a lg optimus g a galaxy s4 and a lenovo tablet all running 4.1+

16746426
mouse	keyboard
i have to use libusb 1.0.16rc10 because there is a bug in the newest stable release that breaks mouse and keyboard functionality on the mbp for a short period of time ever time you scan for devices

16746501
portrait	landscape
i won t bother showing the names list because it which works fine on my tablet running ics both in landscape and portrait modes

16746505
bids	ssis
i am getting this error when i try to open any ssis project in bids 2008 and work on that

16746512
move	drag
i can drag move the command prompt window around the screen but i can t get to the form window to click a button for example or stop the operation

16746539
versioning	upgrade
and again the reason i can t just upgrade netbeans+glassfish is that i have multiple problems with objectdb with versioning of glassfish above 3.1.1 which is why i am so adamant about installing jsf mojarra 2.1.21 on netbeans7.1+glassfish3.1.1

16746566
post	get
and try to avoid mysql_ functions better to use mysqli and try mysql_escape_string for the post and get values

16746653
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
to prevent the padding from increasing the width simply use box-sizing border-box

16746661
openerp	tryton
tinyerp - openerp tryton

16746689
lwjgl	slick2d
i m using lwjgl and slick2d

16746710
postorder	inorder
once i get it working with the inorder traversal the solution should be extensible to pre-order and postorder traversals

16746721
spaces	delimiter
css classes are spaces delimiter in the attribute so

16746743
folder	directory
had to uninstall android studio delete all files related to it including install files the .androidstudiopreview folder under your user directory and those files made in your project s folder upon importing

16746810
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
i have two ideas but before we start i should point out that the badge designer is very html5 heavy and is only supported on firefox safari google-chrome and mobile safari

16746812
qstring	qbytearray
unrelated to all of this note that you can initialize a qbytearray from a qstring like this

16746818
hash	salt
also if anyone notices if the security code is correct in terms of using salt hash bcrypt that would be great

16746826
google-chrome	firefox
edit i also tested with both google-chrome and firefox in incognito mode without extensions

16746840
slideup	slidedown
your div element placement is wrong.put that div in proper place then slideup and slidedown methods should work

16746851
google-chrome	firefox
it starts a browser google-chrome firefox ie etc with an extension loaded into it that allows you to control the browser

16746898
width	height
-view if this flag is present then the next six arguments specify the min_x max_x min_y max_y width and height components of the view rectangle

16746898
width	height
if the flag is not present then the view rectangle defaults to position min_x of -10 max_x of 10 min_y of -7.5 max_y of 7.5 width of 1024 and height of 768

16746924
trie	tree
this way you would instead have a trie instead of a tree

16746935
implements	modifiers
also i would at least consider making the modifiers a list which could be easier to implements and debug

16747062
versioning	upgrade
increment the module versioning number and dnn will notice it s an upgrade and only run sql scripts that match the module versioning number

16747093
google-chrome	firefox
when i hover on menu in firefox it works well but does not show effects on hover in google-chrome

16747140
hide	show
if you want to show it on mouse over and hide on mouse out

16747140
hide	show
however you don t need to use jquery if you just want to show hide the inner popcontain

16747150
shadowing	named
it s a small point but file is a built-in type in python and by assigning to that you are rebinding the named and shadowing the built-in type

16747186
mongodb	bson
mongodb is a document oriented database in which the documents are stored in a format called bson and limited to a maximun of 16mb

16747187
free	malloc
a good way to mess malloc really badly is to write before some malloc -ed zone like then future free and malloc could exhibit very weird behavior.

16747214
curry	first-class
functions are first-class objects which covers point 1 there is function.apply which lets you implement curry yourself so that covers point 2 but other than that dart isn t very functional immutability -- no referential transparency -- no lazy evaluation -- no what else have you -- probably also no

16747235
factors	matrix
between the two you ve asked it looks like matrix multiplication+reshape wins in efficiency by a factors of 3 over repmat

16747240
ubuntu	linux
i run the server on glassfish v3 on a ubuntu linux system and communication with gcm works well

16747268
post	get
sorry for the long post just trying to get all my thoughts down

16747282
super	implements
taking one class as super class and implements rest of the code in

16747325
implements	extends
tv must implements not extends remote

16747340
post	get
take a look at this post javascript - get element from within an iframe

16747364
udp	tcp
now as to which protocol you should choose again very dependent if you plan for the two machines to be talking all the time tcp may be your best it will prevent you from atleast ensuring that packet s are not lost a luxury udp handles at protocol s higher in the stack

16747364
udp	tcp
if you expect updates to be more spread apart you will want to avoid tcp simply because of the tcp handshake process of opening a connection which will require 3x the sum of delay s mentioned above where as udp will allow you to send the packet s write away and then wait for a response on the same socket ensuring the packet was received correctly if you don t get a responce within time x retry

16747369
superclass	subclassing
one more thing prefer to add code to your superclass when you think it is reusable for all subclassing or when they do a super

16747393
ienumerable	ienumerator
as dan pointed out his method is using ienumerable not ienumerator

in my action class i have getter and setter for these arrays

subtract	add
foreach char in the array subtract the char value with 64 if you use uppercase or 96 if you use lowercase and add it into result

16751395
dictionary	map
so it seems that the iterable that you supply to the function such as apply_async i used map and imap_unordered can contain a list of numbers or strings or even a detailed dictionary data structure as long as the values aren t objects

16751396
post	get
i get that the json is not correct but when i post it in their testing suite it is ok

put	get
i had this code in a script and it ran just as intended but then when i put into a basic codeigniter model to run it i get a 500 error

maven	pom.xml
i cant get it to produce any pom.xml file following the guide on maven

16751513
filtering	grouping
besides the fact that it does not work i feel it is wrong to try and filtering for same grouping of user and portfolio in the view like this

16751578
google-chrome	firefox
when i set browser google-chrome it opens firefox anyway

16751592
accessor	properties
fields have a visibility this determines what other classes can see the field so in the above example a private field can only be used by the class that contains it but the properties accessor provides readonly access to the field by subclasses

16751592
accessor	properties
a properties lets you get sometimes called an accessor or set sometimes called a mutator the value of field.

16751592
public	protected
properties let you do a couple of things prevent writing a field for example from outside the class change the visibility of the field eg private protected public

16751593
filtering	grouping
so filtering your portfolio based on the grouping and user identifiers inside the controller action

16751594
post	put
put that in html so the post request will send email too to your controller

it works at least in google-chrome 27 and firefox 21

16751718
post	get
i have a page called test_photo.php which people get directed to from a form after doing a post request

16751718

the problem is that whenever someone perform a get request on the page the post data disappears

16751730
prepare	pdostatement
is a pdostatement which you just prepare

16751737
g++	gcc
i m using the gnu compilers gcc and g++

microsoft.build	nuget
also mono v2.10 is missing some of it s microsoft.build classes which nuget needs you can copy the v3.0.x dll which is very small to the .nuget directory

16751775
bash	zsh
and shells even though the original question specified bash and zsh

16751775
unix	bsd
the bad thing about the -fprintf flag is that it is only available with gnu find and is not a posix standard flag so it won t be available on os x or bsd find 1 though gnu find may be installed on your unix as gfind or gnufind

16751775
division	modulo
- - then performing modulo division on it using the number of lines in the file as the divisor

16751776
getter	setter
in any language an attribute with the trivial getter and setter is really public anyway

16751776
getter	setter
the only possible concern is that you might one day want to change the implementation of the getter setter so that they re no longer trivial without changing your interface

16751776
getter	setter
python can address this problem with properties basically allow you to make method calls that look like reading or writing to an attribute so there s absolutely no reason to have getter setter methods unless there s actually something more going on in them

16751805
post	get
but in any case you should be able to view both get and post data

16751805
post	get
now when you say someone perform a get request on the page - if you mean someone pastes the url in a browser and hits enter then you will never see that post data in this case

16751821
fadein	fadeout
if you take a look you will see when you click the change button the red div will fadeout completely and then the blue div will fadein

16751831
typedef	struct
the struct node has the members and struct i typedef

16751833
post	get
i didn t think a get request would destroy your post data

16751854
post	get
although javascript is dynamically and weakly typed and it would appear that the use of the operator new is a device thrown in by brendan eich to make the language look more like c and java when he really wanted a scheme-like language to begin with see this post by brendan eich for more on this apochryphal story you may get a few advantages from constructors

16751861
gridview	formview
i m working with a gridview where i display essential information and a formview where all of the information of one single record is shown when you click the select button in the gridview

16751872
put	get
the correct way to get around this would be to put the other code in another app that doesn t have the internet permission and call to it via aidl

16751891
dotcms	magnolia
magnolia cms - looks around the same alley as dotcms and hippo as well

16751911
post	get
you are mixing get and post in a way that is incorrect

16751911
post	get
what you should do it posting the form as post and then building a query of get -parameters

16751929
post	get
get values don t destroy post ones you have to understand this a little better that s all

16751929
post	get
when you load another page including get parameters post disappears because it is not persistent across page loads

16752032
google-chrome	firefox
it can be easily done in google-chrome but i didn t find any api to do that in firefox

16752074
mouse	keyboard
you still use the view for handling mouse and keyboard events but any resulting drawing must be handled by core animation.

16752115
jar	war
the project is currently setup as a war and i am able to create the jar using the jar jar goal

16752115
jar	war
having a war project enables me to autodeploy changes and run them instantly whereas a jar project would require 2 builds one build for the jar itself and one for a test webapp that uses this jar

16752115
jar	war
however since the project is setup as a war the artifact deployed to my local maven repo is also a war but the jar is the desired artifact

16752115
jar	war
just for clarification i know the common way is to have a jar project and a separate war project that depends on the jar

16752137
jscrollpane	jtableheader
put jtable to the jscrollpane jtable should be placed into jscrollpane otherwise jtableheader isn t visible automatically

16752137
put	get
get jtableheader from jtable change layoutmanager for jpanel to borderlayout put jtable to center area jtableheader to nothr area

16752140
serializable	deserialization
the data contact serializable built into the.net framework have the concept of known types where you tell them what types to expect and it uses those during deserialization

16752151
required	placeholder
abstracttablemodel required that getcolumnname be overridden otherwise placeholder column names are used

16752155
screens	mdpi
here 39.5 is radius this will perfectly show result on mdpi screens

16752161
punctuation	words
each words may only have 1 character of punctuation on either side of it

16752168
qt-creator	kdevelop	anjuta	kdevelop
you might need to checkout wxdevcpp devcpp is dead anjuta kdevelop qt-creator and more

16752179
nsmutablestring	nsstring
now originally i was thinking seeing nsstring is non mutable i would need to create a nsmutablestring above the loop then change the getstring call to return a mutable nsstring or cast the return from the call

16752246
width	height
notably the height and width are set to 0 and there are other styles applied

16752246
google-chrome	firefox
i have no idea why this is happening but there are two links loaded along with the image and this only happens in google-chrome so i don t know why google-chrome has decided to do this but firefox doesn t

16752328
width	height
i also would like to do this without using fixed values like fixed height width and those views should fill the screen equally like in the example

16752330
fink	macports
if it was installed with macports or fink it may not be in the proper directory for the r makefile directive to xcode make to find it

16752386
post	get
my app was in sandbox mode and therefore i did get the post_id but the app didn t really post

16752387
put	get
you could put that in your function to get the result you want

16752391
textview	imageview
in link there are imageview textview and table layout so relative layout is better solution

16752393
width	height
to do this you use match_parent with the width and height attributes of the view

16752401
width	height
you of course need to add in the properties for width height etc.

16752440
subtraction	addition
given the year the month and day i have to validate it first and do addition and subtraction to the date

16752521
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome but doesn t change in firefox when the user changes the zoom level

16752546
range	min
and one more thing - if the range of numbers is small enough you could do some manipulation on the numbers just subtract the min and encode it which will cost you less digits

16752553
implements	extends
actually my colleague created the class animateur that extends thread and implements runnable

16752577
getter	setter
i am learning c# and am learning about making fields private to the class and using getter and setter to expose methods instead of field values

16752641
getter	setter
yes the method2 is the way to go when you have a custom getter and setter function

16752664
width	height
well when you click on the button expands on the text along with the text steadily increasing width and or height

16752666
mouseleave	mousedown	mouseup	mouseleave	mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup
my problem is if the mousedown occurs in the iframe and the mouseleave the iframe the document won t trigger it s own mousemove events until a mouseup occurs

16752666
mouseup	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseup
i ve tried triggering mouseup in both the iframe and the document once the mouseleave the iframe but the document mousemove events won t resume until a physical mouseup occurs

16752683
std	ostream
i want to use std copy to pass elements from the vector let s say the int to ostream something like the following which ofcourse doesn t work

moving from thin to unicorn

16752776
folder	directory
im tying to cd to that folder but it keep saying no such file or directory

width	height
i have a uicontainerview with frame x 20 y 88 width 728 height 660 and a uiscrollview embedded inside it

16752790
width	height
the uiscrollview reports frame x 0 y 0 width 768 height 960 that results in an offset of 40 the section in gold in the width when paging the uiscrollview

16752790
width	height
however contentsizeforviewinpopover reports the expected frame size width 728 height 660

16752791
ubuntu	linux
on your system ubuntu 13.04 unix or linux calling fflush stdin

16752812
zfcuser	bjyauthorize
so far i got bjyauthorize running with zfcuser what i would like to do is

16752824
hide	show
i also need to show and hide them at will

16752896
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
this works fine in google-chrome safari firefox etc

16752942
google-chrome	firefox
this solution compared to others here is between 2 to 50 times faster on google-chrome and 5 to 50 times faster on firefox as you might see here

16752947
getter	setter
also make sure the getter and setter are valid

16752984
width	height
let s say that i have a square centered at 100 100 and its width height is 100

16752984
width	height
so because the canvas apply the transformation in reverse order my transformed square s top-left corner will be now at 0 0 and its height width will be 200

16753011
punctuation	words
i would do this in two passes first the punctuation after each words

16753011
punctuation	words
then a pass for the punctuation before the words

16753022
post	get
i cannot get the _post values using this- request- post on my controller

16753035
httpresponse	request	httprequest	httpresponse
the servlet handles each request httprequest by creating a new thread that will finally produce the response httpresponse

16753036
onresume	onpause
- and if you want to start or stop actions and and application related flows better to rely on onresume and onpause

16753064
uiview	subviews
now drag a uitableview and add it as subviews to a uiview at say y 150 and keep this tableview bottom aligned

16753064
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
second solution would be you can add your uiviewcontroller to a uinavigationcontroller

16753064
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you need to then create another uiviewcontroller which will have only a uiwebview which will be pushed on uinavigationcontroller when uitableviewcell is selected

16753070
children	parent
below is a recursive function to resort an array placing children beneath parent

16753105
pecl	pear
install the intl extension maintained by pecl â you may have to add the pecl channel to pear first

16753105
pecl	pear
if you use mamp and have never worked with pear pecl check lullabot s helpful blog post

16753116
put	get
in fact i only put the __lt__ and __eq__ there because i was trying to figure out a way to just use one of python s built-in sorting systems but couldn t get that to work

16753119
children	parent
below is a recursive function to resort an array placing children beneath parent

16753124
realloc	memmove
edit i think i ve found a solution with realloc and shifting with memmove each time a client disconnects to cover his socket at the fds

16753124
realloc	memmove
it increases cache locality but at the cost of having to call memmove and realloc every time a client disconnects

16753127
postgresql	mysql
heroku db push does not work with sql server it works with mysql and or postgresql

16753139

16753158
post	get
fiddler catch first get request but when i sending post request

16753199
google-chrome	firefox
you should use a function to round because of the differences between firefox and google-chrome not rounding the same way with tofixed.

16753217
puts	gets
what i want to do is when i hit this button update the variables of the workspace in the central matlab window by running a m-file that makes all the changes opens files gets data and puts them in cell arrays and when running again refreshes the data

16753228
google-chrome	firefox
i think you might be missing something else - this jsfiddle does a put request on newest google-chrome and firefox 21

16753261
int	double
i ve also created a struct of intpoint so each point is 2 int instead of 2 double

16753273
width	height
in your reshape function you set the region for objects to be 0 width in the x direction and 0 height in the y direction with the call to gluortho2d

16753279
google-chrome	safari
that actually works brilliant in google-chrome on my mac but safari ignores it

16753385
keydown	keyup
right now i m using events and i remember if last event was a keyup or keydown to know if a button is held down

16753397
domcontentloaded	onload
if the script relies only on the dom it can resume in ondomready domcontentloaded if it relies on images to be loaded or stylesheets to be applied then if i read the above reference correctly that code must be deferred until the onload event

16753426
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

16753428
pull	push
a third way is to pull from the contributors instead of letting them push as stephen suggests

16753524
rubygems	bundler
that seems to allow bundler to install from both the vendor cache source and rubygems

16753544
put	get	post	get	post	put
the api returns a json array for all requests get post put and delete and everything works fine for everything except delete requests

16753568

marionette	underscore.js
i m currently using backbone marionette and underscore.js

16753625
google-chrome	firefox

qnetworkrequest	qnetworkaccessmanager
the qnetworkrequest class part of the qt framework holds a request to be sent with qnetworkaccessmanager

16753701
post	get
i can not post any attempts because i can not get started -

16753735
post	get
if you use get instead of post remember to use _get var2 in your php script to get that variable

16753771
temp	tmp
or if i want to write to a tmp file do not remove the line i showed above but replace fh by the temp file you create before with temp tmp file

16753777
hide	show
where showfunc and hidefunc are custom animation functions which not only show hide the node but also expand collapse their height

16753778
cypher	gremlin
alternatively this could also all be done in gremlin or cypher with neo4django s helper functions if that s a better fit eg

16753886
margin	height
use margin padding or put a block element between them with a certain height

16753904

freebsd	netbsd
netbsd removed uarea swap-out support freebsd might have done that too

16754006
hide	show
i didn t see an easy solution to hide show menu items without having this open close event to rely on

16754070
jobs	cron
right now i m just linking to the php scripts but it seems like useless recomputing since 95 of the time nothing will have changed and is not really time sensitive i could always add an automatic push when i update content anyway - in which case it wouldn t even need cron jobs

16754120
put	get
if for example you put text area to the center of borderlayout it will get the maximal size

16754124
client-side	server-side
this was unacceptable for my needs as i plan to have other programmers take my client-side code as an api and abstract away the server-side details.

16754165
width	height
the handle to the bitmap as well as the width and height are all easy enough to get but i m unsure of how to get the pixels

16754215
getter	setter
i am also unclear why the kwarg figure is there i think it is an artifact of the way that inheritance works the way that the documentation is auto-generated and the way some of the getter setter work is automated

16754302
spaces	delimiter
at first i was thinking about splitting that line into 3 vars and use spaces like delimiter so i was trying to search for sh replacement for php command but then i found line like this

16754363
folder	directory
this however gives me all the files in the directory so instead of zipping 700 files it zips all 53 000 files in the folder which isn t what i wanted

16754371
vb.net	vb6
i suppose it is about vb6 not vb.net because setstandard s .

16754380
debian	centos
assuming that you re using an image derived from the debian or centos images recommended by gcutil it s likely one of the following

16754380
debian	centos
there s a script that runs every minute on the standard compute engine centos and debian images which fetches the sshkeys metadata entry from the metadata server and creates accounts with sudoers access as necessary

clang	llvm
i think you should first understand how phi works possibly by compiling small pieces of c code into llvm ir with clang and see what gets generated

16754434
post	get
ajax - post request always fails i always get error response

16754480
width	height
use same width height and border-radius

16754517

textview	imageview
on left side is view that i present map using supportmapfragment on the right is one i have switched next with 2 diffrent views imageview and textview but yellow part of textview is transparent like my application window su user can notice eg

16759954
for-loop	loops	division	addition
hi everyone i fetch the data through for-loop now i want to perform addittion n division on ths data as data is fetch in the form of row n each row number are divided and addition by their own parameters how can i defined theses condition in loops for every value

16759957
bash	zsh
i need a portable solution that works under bash and zsh specifically

16759961
free	realloc
realloc with a size of zero is equivalent to free on some c implementations but not all

16759972
migrate	upgrade
this could give you other errors from other scripts but then use jquery migrate to upgrade them

16759986
folder	directory
2 -srd switch manually author the bin directory in another wxs file and get heat to reference it as the parent of the harvested items without generating another directory for the root folder release

16759992
getter	setter
when using managed bean in jsf remember to not put any business logic in your getter setter

16759996
post	get
you should try using mysql_real_escape_string for all post and get requests like

16760023
integer	unsigned
implicit conversion loses integer precision unsigned long to unsigned int

16760075
neo4j	titan
having said that this problem is probably best suited to be modelled using graph databases such as neo4j or titan

16760080
free	realloc
so use free and don t rely on realloc

16760080
free	malloc
when using malloc and free remember that they must be matched exactly

16760080
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
you need to free the exact pointer value returned by malloc or realloc

16760086
free	realloc
realloc array 0 is not equivalent to free array

16760086
free	realloc
in this case in your code the memory is leaked since when realloc fails it does not free the original memory block you passed to it which is the reason why you never do but you always use an intermediate variable to check for null in order to avoid memory leaks

16760086
free	malloc	free	memcpy	free	realloc	realloc	malloc	memcpy	malloc	memcpy	realloc
more intuitively realloc is conceptually equivalent to to malloc + memcpy + free on the other pointer and malloc -ing a 0-byte chunk of memory returns either null either a unique pointer not to be used for storing anything you asked for 0 bytes but still to be free ed

16760086
free	malloc
when you free a pointer it doesn t magically get wiped - your pointer still points to where it pointed but that memory is no longer yours - it s now back to the c runtime which will probably re-give it away in a future malloc

16760086
free	malloc
by the way remember that if you contains pointers to stuff allocated with malloc you have to free them first otherwise you re leaking memory

16760086
free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc	realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc
crashes in malloc calloc realloc or free are almost always related to heap corruption such as overflowing an allocated chunk or freeing the same pointer twice

16760096
sorting	grouping
but since you tagged this question with mysql i ll mention a mysql-specific tip when your query implicitly generates a temporary table for instance while sorting or grouping by varchar fields are converted to char to gain the advantage of working with fixed-width rows

16760111
for-loop	loops
i think the real problem is here you bounded your inside for-loop with whihc i think should be because your bound for that loops should be the cell count of the current row not the number of the current row

16760112
children	parent
in the above table i m trying to update the parent with the count of its children how many children a parent has

16760112
children	parent
the parent are type 3 and children are type 10 and the country codes are at the side

valgrind	memcheck
run your program under the valgrind memcheck tool

16760376
google-chrome	firefox
it works for firefox and google-chrome but fails for ie

16760376
google-chrome	firefox
normally i would tell the user to use google-chrome or firefox but this is for work and we are restricted to ie

16760397
unix	bsd
if you are running windows 2000+ or a unix derivative linux bsd osx we have use of tools like cron to start us off

16760497
firefox	safari
safari renders correctly while firefox has the same problem but renders the button bigger at the bottom

16760508
folder	directory
you ll need to notice the path folder you want the csr public and private key in and openssl.cnf location and update it from wampdeveloper s to wampserver s or just use whatever path folder you want via the cd change directory command

16760532
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization in java

16760532
serializable	deserialization
deserialization is the opposite process of serializable where we retrieve the object back from the storage medium

16760557
division	multiplication
since 8-bit cpus typically can t do fast division or even multiplication it is often not a good idea to use a linear congruential generator

16760570
google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	firefox	safari
everything is working great in google-chrome and firefox but i ve got problems in safari .

16760584
accelerometer	gyroscope
so after googling this i found that using gyroscope sensor is more accurate than the accelerometer

16760592
for-loop	loops
you could try a while loops like this but the for-loop expresses this much better

16760661
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade to gedit 2.8 and versioning 2 of this plugin is way faster now

16760713
padding	overlapping
since this takes the text out of the flow of the document you will need to add some padding to the bottom of your link to prevent the text from overlapping the image

16760744
folder	directory
to change ownership of a folder to tomcat so it can write to the directory use the chmod command

16760768
instances	transient
moreover using serializable tends to lock you into supporting a particular class implementation it destroys encapsulation because much of your object s state becomes part of the class s exported api once it becomes serializable this can be proactively deferred by marking certain instances fields as transient

16760781
hide	show
i would like to show and hide regions based on value of one of the fields from page p1

16760830
google-chrome	safari
the problem is that this works only on google-chrome and safari

16760832
daemons	launchd
sql full-text filter daemons launchd mssqlserver

16760838
width	height
by the way you shouldn t use width and height attributes which have been deprecated since at least the beginning of this century but if you are using them anyway give them a number for their values not a css-style length

16760846
magnolia	alfresco	liferay	magnolia	liferay	alfresco
i do know a little about alfresco liferay and magnolia but i have not worked with them before

16760846
dotcms	magnolia
you are right about hippo magnolia and dotcms being somewhat similar which isn t that strange because they try to solve the same problem being an enterprise class java based web content management system

16760846
postgresql	mysql
i have not played with this setup myself but it sounds promising especially because each node can be a simple and cheap box that only uses postgresql mysql and tomcat and because there is no single point of failure anymore

16760856

16760881
public	protected
one way to do this is by just making public properties in the current class and use a naming convention like names starting with a underscore to denote the protected stuff

16760881
public	protected
if you want real protected variables you need to separate the table for the public and the protected stuff

16760955
google-chrome	firefox
however it is working on my pc firefox google-chrome and mac google-chrome

16760956

16761031
post	get
3 the rule of thumb says you should present data with get and manipulate data with post

16761034
hide	show
i think i m missing something dumb because my show hide functions aren t working and i don t think the link is getting created right

16762989
equals	gethashcode
i have a class foo with two fields where the equals and gethashcode methods have been overridden

16762989
equals	gethashcode
and if i comment out the equals and gethashcode overrides but keep the implementation the answer is also 4

16762989
equals	gethashcode
at best the implementation supports the already provided equals and gethashcode overrides and at worst it completely corrupts the equality comparison

16763005
equals	gethashcode
if you implement equals you should also override the base class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the method

16763005
equals	gethashcode
your implementation of equals foo isn t consistent with either equals object or gethashcode

16763005
equals	gethashcode
will still delegate to your gethashcode method - it will just use your equals t method in preference to your equals object method

16763005
equals	gethashcode
it should be consistent with equals object for the sake of sanity and it must be consistent with gethashcode for the sake of correctness

16763056

not completely sure i understand what you re looking for but to get a list of post that a user has either created or shared you can use union to combine the results

dynamic arrays in c are declared using malloc and calloc

16766692

16766782

if you re relying on cors headers in your xmlhttprequest then you have to use xdomainrequest for ie versions smaller than 10 and larger than 7 don t think ie 7 has support for cors at all xmlhttprequest xdomainrequest or otherwise

16767240
hide	show
the answer depends on whether the field on p1 can be changed dynamically by the user and if you want the regions to hide show as the field is changed

16767240
hide	show
or if the field is static set once at page load time and so we only need to show hide the regions when the page is first loaded

16767240
hide	show
set the true action to show one region and hide the other region

16767240
hide	show
set the false action to do the opposite hide the first region and show the other

then you ll need to convert the output ciimage to a cgimage and from there to a uiimage

16782221
width	height
note that you want the width and height of the image view to be fixedâ not sizable

16782221
width	height
for example if you re animating off the right edge change the x origin to the x coordinate of the screen s right edge and the width to zero and leave the y origin and height untouched

16782223
width	height
i feel that your aim is to edit the layout parameters but instead of doing that what you are doing is you are assigning a new set of parameters with width and height as layoutparams.wrap_content and then setting the margins

apache	nginx
nginx has tradeoffs too far fewer support resources less uptake in the enterprise hasn t been around as long as apache need to recompile if you want to add a new module etc

getter	setter
properties getter setter in java are good examples of code that usually doesnâ t contain any logic and doesnâ t require testing

16797747
getter	setter
i would say don t write unit tests for setter and getter unless your setter and getter contain program logic something getting computed as the setter or getter is called

16797747
getter	setter
on a real project you will have more than plenty program logic to unit test without having to test something trivial like setter and getter

16797757
getter	setter
if your getter and setter are trivial then they can only fail if the underlying jvm compiler fails - so you re actually testing the jvm compiler not your code

16797790
getter	setter
however getter and setter can be automatically generated they typically only contain one line in the method and if they cause your code to fail you probably have bigger problems

16797790
getter	setter
it s not common practise with unit testing to bother testing the getter and setter and you can avoid testing them and your unit testing will still be comprehensive
