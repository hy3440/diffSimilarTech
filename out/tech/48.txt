5903481
stdout	fflush
i guess that these lines have shorter output so the fflush frequency is lower i used the stdout line to print a deliberate help message

5903497
client-side	server-side
as alternative approach you can use some jquery plugin that handles all client-side processing and take data from the server-side code

5903537

5903627
stdout	stderr
this error may appear when you use an interpreter that overrides stdout stderr such as idle though idle itself would give you a different error

5903627
stdout	stderr
it may also be caused by a library which overrides stdout stderr

5903627
stdout	stderr
anyway it seems that what you re trying to do with your code is to redirect stdout stderr yourself

maven	m2e
this is because m2e sees servlet-api-2.5 as a dependency of my project and considers it as part of maven dependencies and copies it as part of the deployment assembly but the tomcat servlet container has its own copy of this and doesn t like seeing 2 copies on the class path

choosing between fstat and the fseek ftell combination there isn t going to be much difference

leaving the content of a deallocated block untouched or even writing just zeros will increase the possibility that someone reading the content of a dead memory block will still find the values reasonable and compatible with invariants a null pointer as on many architectures null is just binary zeroes or the int 0 the ascii nul chars or a double value 0.0

5907792
int	double
by writing instead strange patterns like 0xdeadbeef most of code that will access in read mode those bytes will probably find strange unreasonable values the int -559038737 or a double with value -1.1885959257070704e+148 hopefully triggering some other self consistency check assertion

5907798

as a result of my research you cannot add a uitabbaritem to a uitabbar that is managed by a uitabbarcontroller

5908848

in classic asp using a post instead of a get is a matter of changing your form from method get to method post

5908848
post	get
access both post and get data

5908848
post	get
so to change the code from using get to post in the asp code you will need to change any request.querystring instructions to request.form or simply request

i ve tested this on google-chrome my primary browser and firefox and it hasn t worked properly on either

5908969
int	boolean
an association of course is the uml term for all kinds of references between real classes entity composite pk class enums etc. that is - as i understand it - not necessarily a reference to one of the java simple wrapper types like int string boolean etc

5908979

i am passing the paramter subsession id as hidden parameter and i m submitting the form as post because my application should not allow get requests

5909220
stdout	stderr
they also shine at redirecting stdin stdout and stderr for these in lots of ways and are pretty good at reacting to error codes returned by programs called

5909220
bash	tcsh	bash	zsh	zsh	tcsh
while shell scripts especially for shells that are properly scriptable such as bash or zsh certainly not csh or tcsh do provide lots of other useful stuff and allow writing just about anything a student i knew thought the numerics assignment was simply too easy for him so he wrote his code as a bash script â working fine of course the syntax is simply not optimized for that and you typically have to write strange line noise to even increase n by 1

5909223
postgresql	mysql
i have changed database from postgresql to mysql but i don t know how to transfer data from one to other

5909223
postgresql	mysql

5909224
sorting	filtering
the reason of such strange at the first glance json data is that jqgrid is designed to support paging sorting and filtering searching of data implemented on the server

5909224
sorting	filtering
if you has small number of rows under some hundert for example you can use client based sorting paging and filtering if you add loadonce true parameter of the jqgrid but the server based implementation allows you to work with really large dataset having many hundred thousands rows of data with very good performace

5909259
equals	gethashcode
if gethashcode returns the same value equals is called

5909259
equals	gethashcode
from why is it important to override gethashcode when equals method is overridden

5909259
equals	gethashcode
so what could go wrong if for example and i hear a lot of programmers screaming in horror gethashcode returns a constant to force the call to equals

5909260
versioning	upgrade
the jquery validation plugin was upgrade with nuget at versioning 1.8.0 and jquery library to 1.6

i was looking for similar solution like the one used in blend and with your mentions i created simple behavior class with two attached properties width height that are applied only in desintime

5909397
hash	md5
our system uses md5 hash passwords but the latest version of phpbb3 has a different format phpass so i need to write a script that will replace the phpbb password with the account password for roughly 300 000 users

5909397
hash	md5
we used the same usernames and passwords for both so each record in our_db.accounts has the md5 hash of the same encrypted password in phpbb.users

5909402

what you are doing when in your first one is that you are sending it as a get that being said when you want to post like you suggested you need to set post to be correct as well

i think it will be finding the chars a b c which is a string and failing to take it as an int

5909633
superclass	subclassing
i suspect you have a uiviewcontroller subclassing which does have that method but for some reason you re calling the superclass

5909667
post	get
it then looks to see whether the method was a get or a post it also receives arguments from the form in name value pairs also known as a query string

5909667
post	put
if the method was a post method then it is put into the request body

5909677
firefox	safari
a custom background plugin has started to cause certain browsers firefox ie8 9 safari to reveal an appended url string when viewing the index page - this mostly shows when not visiting the site directly but rather when going through for example google - ie utf-8 q dear+earth

5909866
youtube	vimeo
i had to support linking both youtube and vimeo videos

5909930
put	get
i have the closest thing i can get to an enum in javascript which is basically a globally scoped json style variable with a load of constants it is used to describe event types so rather than every class that wants to raise listen to events having to put hard coded strings it can just use a constant from this enum variable

5910002
post	get
this is most commonly used in forms as the name that gets post d or get d through to the server side language

5910004
width	height
i cannot access the iframe cross domain â i just need the height width

5910013

i started doing an dependencyobject with attached properties but i am not sure how to forward the property values like interval to the internal dispatchertimer

5910032
dependencyobject	dispatchertimer
silverlight doesn t seem to provide any events when the dependency properties change and dispatchertimer is not a dependencyobject so i can t databind directly to its properties

5910137
equals	gethashcode
s implementations of equals and gethashcode don t seem to do this i think they re just the defaults

5910137
equals	gethashcode
i can override equals to use setequals but what about gethashcode

5910149
mousemove	mousedown
so your code will add an event handler to listen for mousedown when the dom is ready once it occurs it will add an event for mousemove - the document now has both event handlers registered so it will do stuff for both independently

5910149
mousemove	mouseup
what you want to do is remove the event handler for the mousemove on the mouseup event

5910266
google-chrome	firefox
under firefox and google-chrome it s ok

google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried it on firefox 4.0.1 and google-chrome 11 with the same effect

5910491
for-loop	arrays
if you want to handle all of them in that fashion you will need to create an arrays and push all the matching ones on to it and then return the arrays after the for-loop have finished

5910535
put	get
in fact in your case the regexes differ only in the separator characters used so you could put them in a character class to get a common regex

5910547

the main reason is add has been implements as protected with no modifiers which becomes protected

5910552
udp	tcp
if the bus can be small you might like to work with http adapters or even lower like tcp or udp

hid	keyboard
our scanners use usb hid if you select usb hid keyboard it installs as dual-interface unit where you have the hid pos as secondary interface

5912659

that means the scanner sends bar code data to the keyboard buffer and you can send commands via the usb hid pos interface to the scanners

5912673
post	get
an initial view is been created upon a get request and an existing view is been reused upon a post request

5912673
post	get
when a get request results in a response with a for post then the partial view is referenced by a hidden input field with name javax.faces.viewstate

5912674
stdout	stderr
as for the larger problem you can subclass popen rewrite __init__ to accept stream-like objects as arguments to stdin stdout stderr and rewrite the _communicate method hairy for crossplatform you need to do it twice see the subprocess.py source to call read on the stdin stream and write the output to the stdout and stderr streams

5912886
opera	google-chrome
this works for me in google-chrome 11 and opera 11.10

5913014
integer	unsigned
the program doesn t actually care if 0x00000101 as 5 decimal it just has an unsigned integer with value 0x00000101 that it can perform operations legal for unsigned integers upon and will behave in a given manner if you try to compare with or cast to a different type of variable

5913041
post	get
about post and get learn some http basics

5913068
post	get
as far as the difference in doget and dopost the only difference is the http method they respond to as the servlet api abstracts any differences between actual http get and http post methods away from the programmer

5913080
ready	each
you should split the high-level requirements into features to help estimate and prioritise them but leave the detailed scenario writing to just before you re ready to begin implementing each feature

5913115
zero	decimal-point
if the precision is explicitly zero no decimal-point character appears

5913148
namedtuple	dictionary
at its heart the namedtuple is an odd fit for json since it is really a custom-built type whose key names are fixed as part of the type definition unlike a dictionary where key names are stored inside the instance

5913148
namedtuple	dictionary
this prevents you from round-tripping a namedtuple you cannot decode a dictionary back into a namedtuple without some other a piece of information like an app-specific type marker in the dictionary which is a bit hacky

5913148
namedtuple	dictionary
this is not ideal but if you only need to encode namedtuple into dictionary another approach is to extend or modify your json encoder to special-case these types

5913148
namedtuple	dictionary
this tackles the problem of ensuring that nested namedtuple are properly converted to dictionary

5913153
rsa	aes
the encryption method i m implementing is enveloping data using aes and rsa

5913280
put	get
i now use this code to get the contents of the table after which i put the contents in a .csv

5913304
post	get
this can be get very complex due to the fact mvc requires all lists to be indexed and follow numerically otherwise on post backs you will be missing items aside i feel this was a terrible design decision

5913315
for-loop	if-statement
without an example it is hard to see what you want to do but you can always use an if-statement inside a for-loop

5913319
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works in firefox but not in google-chrome and ie

5913329

you can t change loops index within a for-loop

5913768
cvs	svn
of commented commits percentage of the cvs svn commits that have a comment i know this is subjective as you can just enter update or anything else

5913794
stdout	stderr
ultimately i would like to capture stderr as below audio info is piped to sox via stdout and present it in as a gtk.expander with a similar look to synaptic when it is installing a program with the ability of the user to see things happening in real time

5913808
range	infinity
but if you consider a theoretical computer with infinite precision and period you brought up infinity then you will hit every number in your specified range given infinite time

5913844
ant	maven
maven is more of a meta-program that can use ant scripts and run your junit tests

5913844
ant	maven
true ant can also be used to run junit tests but maven does a good job of pulling all of that together as well as providing extra functionality example the ability to automatically find external dependencies and download them

5913844
ant	maven
while i am not familiar with teamcity i would be surprised if it did not have a way to integrate with ant maven junit

5913860
post	get
the drupal api has a drupal_http_request function which can make post requests as well as get requests

5913865
debian	linux
since i already have the username and password stored as variables what would be the best way to authenticate with pam on linux debian 6

5913884
post	get
this is okay for some things but if you re trying to do background requests to gmaps that require no user input interaction feedback maybe getting long lat of their address when they submit a form then you can modify the code a bit to post when you get the response

5913920
folder	directory
actually i m pretty sure it s a better pratice to have your system and application directory out of the public_html folder

5913927
children	parent
in straight up javascript no extensions such as jquery etc. is there a way to determine a child node s index inside of its parent node without iterating over and comparing all children nodes

5913941
udp	tcp
but in theory it says that it uses both tcp and udp

5913944
google-chrome	safari
on a mac with safari or google-chrome you can save an html page with embedded svg to a pdf

second scala has a concept known as sealed class or trait which limits subclasses or implements object s to those declared in the same file

5914132
button	checkbox
i am designing a very simple c# wpf application following the mvvm pattern with a listview showing around 10 items bound to an object containing an application s details with a checkbox allowing the user to select some applications and then click on the button launch

it works in google-chrome but fails in firefox

5914209
google-chrome	firefox
the click 2 button refers to document.forms.fill and works in both firefox and google-chrome

5914212
children	parent
what you re wanting to do is populate a drop down consisting of the parent and all its descendants what about children of children

5914228
children	parent
here is the code that is doing it...it is really wierd cause when i debug it the number of children of each node grows by one each time as expected but then once all the parent nodes are added there is two of each leaf.

5914239
google-chrome	firefox
yet i am curious why it is standard firefox google-chrome in linux that border color doesn t inherit from the parent and instead defaults to the text color and still border-style won t default to solid

5914283
post	get
i have also seen this post but i can t get it to work

5914305

1.you could lock the activity in one orientation by addingandroid screenorientation portrait or landscape to in your manifest

5914472
width	height
now i want my webview to set it s width as the screenwidth and resize it s height alone to fit the content

5914473
super	implements	super	extends	implements	extends
if you hard-code the subject-matter domain into your implementation by doing things like representing lands or artifacts by extends a super class or implements an interface there are always going to be things you run into that you can t do and fixing these problems may be hard or impossible

5914478
min	max
what i m trying to do is record the on screen x axis positions when you zoom in and out with the mouse as i want to work out the max and min values that are displayed

5914485
post	get
look into the documentation for your framework for a way to get the verbatim text from the post data

5914539
int	double
the floating-point unit fpu on modern x86 is natively double in fact it s even bigger than double not float the 32 in 32-bit describes the int register widths not the floating-point width

5914552
post	get
that being said you should use the input class to get your post data

5914554
pull	push
or she can pull bob s change and merge then push

5914574
hide	show
every solution i come across implements js and is to show hide the div and does not replace the show hide button

5914574
hide	show
the only difference between this and what i want to do is i want my button to be central also and show the trailer over the top of the button with no ability to hide the trailer after it has begun

5914587
post	get
namuol is correct your framework is trying to be very smart for you and applying its own escaping to everything passed through post and get

5914588
put	get
simply put these lines of code in your try block and you will get into the interactive python debugger mode

5914630
cpu	processors
unless you either target 20-year-old cpu s or small limited embedded processors floating-point instructions will be handled in hardware although not all architectures handle every datatype equally efficiently

5914643
width	height
i want to loop through images in an html document and set the width height if they don t exist

5914648

my question is on touchesmoved after i touch with two finger option+click i begin to drag and expected that x y will change randomly like touchesbegan but the result amazed me the x y will be the same same finger co-or as one i got from touchesbegan

5914688
vim	notepad++
additional details when opening the file in notepad++ or vim it looks fine however when viewed in notepad it looks like chinese characters

5914694
int	chars
you do know that you can add int to c++ chars do you

5914694
int	chars
chars in c are just byte-sized int under the hood

5914711
portrait	landscape
edit in this particular app i have a table that shows up in portrait and a chart that shows up in landscape

5914730
implements	extends
a java class can t extends more than one other class but of course it can implements any number of classes

5914746
hash	md5
use an md5 hash of the relative path to your content then modulo this by the number of sharding domains you have

5914746
hash	md5
here s a link to another question answering how to generate md5 hash

5914754
ready	each
each worker thread compresses its bucket using a flush type of sync see the deflate spec and then marks its compressed blob ready for output

5914754
ready	each
as each bucket is written it is marked empty ready to be re-filled by the next stream.write

5914755
client-side	server-side
so replace it on client-side then put it back on server-side

5914777
postgresql	mysql
the difference between postgresql and mysql is that postgresql sees it and complains as it should while mysql often just keeps on going with no stopping

5914778
client-side	server-side
you could use css3 media queries like described here but this will only let you add additional css rules client-side not adjust the image path server-side

5914779
tabs	tabpanel
with this markup i get what i need from both the first tab containing the list and any subsequent tabs templated by the hidden tabpanel ready for cloning .

5914790
post	get
functional tests are really just clients of a running application that make get and post requests and verify the responses so you won t have access to spring beans services etc

5914795
ninject	spring.net
like for example ninject spring.net unity or the members are already correctly initialized in the objects you are using

5914796
jsf	seam	jsf	wicket	wicket	seam
after that you might also want to look at more sophisticated frameworks like jsf or wicket and after that perhaps full-stack frameworks like spring or seam or other more focused server-side technologies such as enterprise javabeans

5914813
getter	setter
because jsf wants it private + getter and setter and the other java class wants it private static + get sets

5914837
width	margin
some of the body text is still spilling out to the right behind the sidebars so there may be a width padding margin problem there as well

5914849
min	max
if you do not have the min and max in different columns you can use the lead lag functions or a self-join to get both of them in the same row as in my test table

5914849
range	max
if you don t have a max value for the last range use nvl or the corresponding function to assign a really large value to define the range

5914862
qt-creator	kdevelop
i d suggest you to check out kdevelop and qt-creator

5914871
qnetworkrequest	qnetworkaccessmanager	qnetworkrequest	qnetworkreply	qnetworkreply	qnetworkaccessmanager
you will want to use qnetworkaccessmanager qnetworkrequest and qnetworkreply classes

5914884
google-chrome	firefox
works as expected in ie firefox google-chrome

5914902
put	get
sftpclient s get and put functions take paths and not file-handles which makes things a bit awkward

5914902
put	get
if it works the get and put functions should now take local file-handles rather than paths

5914916
keydown	keyup
i made a subclass of the nstextfield and i override the keydown event but my code doesn t work then i override de keyup event and the code works perfectly

5914952
subtract	add
you can use functions to add or subtract values like this

5914970
width	height
the above assumes your vm exposes a collection of points via a points property and that each point vm has x y width and height properties

5914979
int	chars
the unsigned chars of course takes up only 1 byte as apposed to the int 4 assuming 32 bit platform here but my understanding is that it would be faster for a processor to read the int value from memory

5914987
terminate	timeout
if you want the function s execution to be terminate after the timeout has been exceeded you might want to try code that has that capability

5915009
express	node.js
i am using node.js with express and have code similar to this as part of my routes

5915021
switching	screens
however c# provides the useful invoke method which allows you to automatically switching thread back to the gui thread to update something on the screens

the verb list can be either a comma-separated list of http verbs for example get put post or a start-script mapping for example the wildcard character an asterisk

5915495
width	height
in this cause you will need to set height and width on #container and make sure the .box es can never expand beyond it

this works fine...but what doesnt seem to work is if the page loads up and i check the grid view header checkbox to true and it selects all the items in the gridview then i click a button such as a delete button that calls some server side code

5915626
width	height
i think that i can write simple program that open the folder of images and read each file and get it s width and height and if it s very high change it and overwrite the image with the small one

5915656
mouse	keyboard
in terms of the actual api and programming like items to be used by the mouse and keyboard rather than the touch screen

google-chrome	firefox
this was happening on google-chrome but not on firefox 3.5 so we didn t really care

5916340
google-chrome	firefox
but firefox 4 behaves just like google-chrome so we had to find another workaround

5916340
google-chrome	firefox
also i found a strange local workaround for google-chrome and firefox 4 using a greasemonkey script modified version of this one

5916340
google-chrome	firefox
is the google-chrome firefox 4 way the correct way to handle these kinds of linebreaks inside

5916349

button	checkbox
the only reason you d want to use checkbox is if you want to turn off all selections with radio button once you ve clicked a button one is always selected

5916456
button	checkbox
you can do this in interface builder too drag a uibutton onto a uitoolbar and it will automatically embed it in a uibarbuttonitem for you - then look for the shows touch on highlight checkbox under the button s settings

5916503
stdout	stderr
in production you ll want to add exception-handling and you can re-route stdout and stderr to be captured

5916530
portrait	landscape
i am trying to design my application so that it has one main.xml layout for portrait and one main.xml layout for landscape

5916530
portrait	landscape
from the reading i ve done it seems that the way to go about this is like so res layout-land main.xml for your landscape file and res layout main.xml for your portrait

5916530
portrait	landscape
that was annoying enough but it appears as though it thinks they are the same file because when it did let me make changes to one of them it would seem that the changes were often as not to the wrong one landscape when i was editing portrait and vice versa

5916581
uiview	calayer
trying to understand the relationship between uiview and calayer

5916581
uiview	calayer
to the view will the layer s background image block them because calayer is backed by uiview

they are equality operators on int uint long ulong decimal float double any enum type bool chars object string and any delegate type

5916645
public	protected
replace protected with public and the code should compile

5916646
inherited	subclassing
b is protected inherited from a thus only subclassing of b knows it s an a

5916652
public	protected
derive b from public a not protected a

5916659
pylons	pyramid
i know that pylons is discontinued as such and is imported to pyramid

5916659
pylons	pyramid
however i really like to learn pylons and could not make my way through pyramid which is still rather premature and lacks begginer-friendly docs so i started to read the online pylons book which i think only covers pylons 0.97 and some of examples like the one about environ did need work for me in pylons 1.0 so i seem to have some bumpers in my learning curve that led me to wonder whether it really worth the effort

5916664
spaces	delimiter
the split method will split a string into an array based on a delimiter in this case a spaces

5916690
multiplying	multiplication
i was looking at this question how to implement multiplication without using multiplication operator in .net and actually had a lot of fun trying to think of ways to multiplying without using

5916711
post	get
i would post my code but i don t know exactly what parts to post so if there are any certain parts that will help just let me know and i will post them otherwise it seems like i have had this problem once before and solved it but it has been a while and i can t remember what exactly the problem was or how i fixed it so any help or pointers to get me going in the right direction will help greatly

5916729
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
the properties of inherited rules out the possibility of derivation of a protected parent class into a subclassing

5916729
public	protected
unless you change protected to public in line #10 so that the protocols are followed and the code looks like this

5916740
ceil	floor
then you have the option to use roundf floor ceil or other operations to shape the number

put	get
so i don t get into my backing bean i already tried to put the scope of my bean to viewscoped but no success

5916803
hide	show
for the converters if you still prefer to hide and show the buttons you should declare a new class that implements ivalueconverter

5916814
int	chars	int	double
as i mentioned in your other question the built-in operators are the equality operators on int uint long ulong bool chars float double decimal object string all delegate types and all enum types plus the lifted-to-nullable versions of all the value types

5916815
children	parent
after determining the location of our element we move our element up in case it has a greater priority than its parent in a similar manner to insertion or down if it has a lower priority than one of its children in a similar manner to deletion and update the modified elements locations in the hash map

5916848
folder	directory
but the directory structure contains a web-app folder as usual not webapp

5916896
osql	bcp
is there a way to get sqlcmd around this limit or does anyone know if another program such as bcp or osql would make this easier

5916908
hide	show
i think that if you want it to be really fast you could just show hide the options

5916936
hide	show
you can hide or disable ui elements that are meaningless without data while the data is being fetched then show them when the data arrives

5917024
chown	chmod
first you need to giving the program as root privileges use chown and chmod as root

5917142
getter	setter
other objects must go through setter and getter methods

5917182
width	height
width 8.28 160 pixels height 24.6 41 pixels font is arial 20 pt

5917182
width	height
range width 96 range height 24.6

5917182
width	height
i tried using pointstoscreenpixelsx and pointstoscreenpixelsy for all of the above values but they returned values which didn t match up with what the excel gui said 396 for row cell height 136 for column width and 224 for column width

5917202
pop-up	dialog
when i try and use facebook with sharekit it pop-up the login dialog i fill in my credentials and then it just disapears it does this in the sample project as well am i doing something wrong

5917247

sometimes it can get tricky to use controls like checkbox and push button if the action they trigger can take a long time

5917276
hibernate	gilead
i have very similar problem - gilead 1.3.1 hibernate

5917277
postgresql	mysql
and it works on oracle mysql postgresql db2 etc

5917324
width	height
i am new to writing arrays and i was wondering if you look at the code below not really complicated how can i get rid of all the other stuff and just have the height and width be applied to cell_1 - cell_21

5917324
width	height
i just want to write all the repeating stuff in one line and use the height and width as vars

5917359
maven	pom.xml
maven pom.xml dependencies

5917359
sitemesh	jspx
didn t have to remove sitemesh at all but i can in the future whenever i m ready and i can migrate jspx files at my leisure

5917360
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
you could just be using bufferedinputstream bufferedoutputstream

5917419
post	get
one of the reasons i don t just want to do rest and use get post etc http verbs is that lower privilege users can only make change requests

5917420
width	height
and i d prefer to not have to declare a height for the containing element as this is for a lengthy image listing and the dimensions will vary but all with a certain max width height

5917433
portrait	landscape
portrait or landscape

5917433
portrait	landscape
for landscape images it works fine but with portrait ones it distorts them like crazy

5917445
getter	setter
to actually use the setter and getter that are synthesized according to your property rules retain etc. you must access them as follows

5917445
getter	setter
you are bypassing the synthesized setter and getter if you access the instance variables directly as follows

5917455
super	extends
you are much better off creating a class that extends textfield and write your own text function that calls the super then expands the height of the textfield to _textheight

5917477
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this will also solve your problem with database versioning because .msi installation package keeps this information so you can create upgrade .msi which will know that it must execute only change script for database instead of creating a new one

5917477
versioning	upgrade
if you need to keep information about database versioning you can have special table for that and check the value in the table at the beginning of the upgrade script

5917479
width	height
setting maxwidth to 800 means height width 800 new height

5917479
width	height
on the other hand means setting maxheight to 800 and thus having width height 800 is new width

5917479
width	height
right now your using both the height width ratio instead of the other way around

5917483
width	height
basically it first calculates the image s proportions in rate based on width height

5917483
width	height
then it checks if the width is going to get out of bounds when resized and if it is - sets width to the desired maximum width and calculates the height accordingly

5917483
width	height
so if is larger than the width should be set to maxwidth and the height should be calculated based on it

5917483
width	height
if the comparison is the other way around just set height to maxheight and calculate the new width

5917492
width	height
you should switch height and width in the second part note the part

5917516
post	get
there s nothing inherently bad about using get requests for non-idempotent operations for example soap uses get or post

5917523
put	get
this information get s put in an array

5917523
min	max
in the next part of my program i am to retrieve min and max values from each data group even and odd store id numbers

5917566
versioning	upgrade
you will want the new versioning when subversion 1.7 is released so upgrade then too

5917566
versioning	upgrade
i read the occasional post here about people running svn 1.4 or older you don t want to be them - upgrade the subversion team is very good about backwards compatibility and painless upgrade but upgrading 3 or 4 versioning up isn t going to be as painless as upgrading 1 major versioning

5917623
for-loop	loops
pull your loops to outside of the function or return a tuple list outside of the for-loop

5917632
post	get
failing that require any non-idempotent calls to be post rather then get

5917643
svg	vml
it renders charts in html5 canvas svg and flash and vml for old ie fallback

5917658
hash	md5
reversing an md5 hash

5917659
stdout	fflush
you can avoid this by using this command sys.stdout.flush which will fflush the stdout stream which forces it to print

5917709
hash	md5
with n being the bitlength of the hash 128 for md5

5917734
hash	md5
a cryptographic hash like md5 is designed to be a one-way function that is it is computationally infeasable to derive the source data from which a given hash was computed

5917734
hash	md5
another weakness in md5 is that due to its relative small size large rainbow tables have been published that let you look up a given md5 hash to get a source input that will collide with the specified hash value

5917821
stdout	stderr
capture both stdout and stderr preferably as single stream without using which fails for some commands here

5917875
tablet	hdpi
my problem is when i m trying to support tablet i don t understand why android divide the resources in different folders hdpi ldpi mpdi large-mdpi ... when that qualifiers isn t useful

5917875

i have several graphics sets according width but i m going crazy for example with the tablet 480x800 with density mdpi or ldpi

5917921
children	parent
protected methods can be called anywhere in the inheritance line of the object parent and children

5917966

beyond that do as mkfnx suggested and use a stack widget or just have a dynamic dialog where you subscribe to your button events using the connect function and hide show your widgets as you wish

5917993
stdout	stderr
in ruby s popen spawn how do i merge both stdout and stderr as a single stream wihthout resorting to using

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
though i think this technique is ill-advised here s something i developed that i ve tested to work in google-chrome firefox safari and ie8

5918296
division	multiplication
learning the principals just like we did at school for long multiplication and division means we know how things work when we use a short hand

5918303
prepare	execute
a little background this is a database class i am building and the prepare method will help escape variables in the query before it is execute

5918315

you should write service classes with jax-rs jax-ws annotations transports exist for both

5918353
subtract	add
add or subtract a value

5918369
return-value-optimization	nrvo
if you mean nrvo named return-value-optimization as opposed to return-value-optimization return-value-optimization then the object has to be named inside the function

5918369
return-value-optimization	nrvo
otherwise it would only be eligible to return-value-optimization not nrvo

5918369
return-value-optimization	nrvo
some compilers like very old compilers won t do return-value-optimization or nrvo at all while other compilers may have different constraints on this optimization

5918397
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome or firebug extension for firefox you can inspect an element on your page by right clicking on it and chosing inspect element

5919686
google-chrome	firefox
it works good for firefox google-chrome but fails to load properly on ie6

5919724
folder	directory
the php files will also need to be organized according to your url directory like index.php staff.php in about folder

5919735
int	chars
why does memset take an int as the second argument instead of a chars whereas wmemset takes a wchar_t instead of something like long or long long

5919745
affinity	processors
you appear to be setting affinity to all 12 processors which is not what you intend

5919745
affinity	processors
if the user changes process affinity then you may end up with a thread that is not able to run on any processors

5919798
int	chars
probably the same reason why the functions in take int and not chars

5919798
int	chars
on most platforms a chars is too small to be pushed on the stack by itself so one usually pushes the type closest to the machine s word size int

5919802
int	chars
without a prototype you can t pass a chars to a function -- when if you try it ll be promoted to int when you pass it and what the function receives is an int

5919802
int	chars
it s also worth noting that in c a chars literal like a does not have type chars -- it has type int so what you pass will usually start out as an int anyway

5919802
int	chars
in theory memset could probably be modified so it receives a chars instead of an int but there s unlikely to be any benefit and a pretty decent possibility of breaking some old code or other

5919804
cpu	processors
each bit corresponds to a logical processors a cpu core or a hyper-thread

5919812
division	addition
the last of these points is particularly interesting in my view allowing things like a generic average method over numeric types with suitable addition and division operators

5919814
yslow	pagespeed
use tools such as yslow pagespeed or

you should use javascript validation for check validation of this form and if all fields having valid values then submmit form via post method.now you will get all your fields in

5920022
post	get
also use a net inspector to see if your browser makes a get request to the same page after the post firebug can help you verify

5920036

with width 4 and height 4 this is what i got

5920202
implements	extends
for example an application can use a dynamic proxy class to create an object that implements multiple arbitrary event listener interfaces-- interfaces that extends java.util.eventlistener -- to process a variety of events of different types in a uniform fashion such as by logging all such events to a file

5920222
put	get
i want to block the object so that it doesn t get empty when i try to put objects in it

5920244

use it to rotate the camera when you change from landscape to portrait and vice versa

5920493
google-chrome	firefox
every solution i encounter won t work on all the browsers either google-chrome won t stretch it or ie won t stretch it and if they both do firefox will be the problematic one

5920494
post	get
you also define where the form should either post get values to

5920498
folder	directory
i ve created this code to cycle through the folder in the current directory and echo out a link to the folder it all works fine

5920501
min	max
something like min max works very well but i can t figure out how to get it to account for the highest similarity not just the min max value

5920501
min	max
i don t really want the min max i want the first non-null value with the highest similarity

5920614
post	get
in case you don t want this behaviour you have to make sure that you perform a get operation after the post the so called redirect after post get after post -technique

5920631
post	get
it may include post get multipart form-data with files to be uploaded

5920633
int	boolean	keyevent	onkeydown

post	get
when i update a content post method i always get 404 page on the main site the one in the root folder

5920671
post	get
if you want post variables to get through you need to do internal rewrites assuming that the rewrite target is on the same server as your .htaccess file

wakelock	powermanager
obtain a wakelock from powermanager and use whatever you want to time your code timer handler etc.

5920746

onclick	onfocus	onfocus	onblur
but events for input controls like textfield such as onclick onfocus onblur dont appear

since there are no details of a field either primary key unique fields auto_increment fields varchar chars int etc..

5920931
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the file api is supported in firefox 3.6+ google-chrome 9+ opera 11.1+ and safari 6

5920941
hide	show
my suggestion is to put two fields on the form and dynamically show hide them to give the same effect

5920967
force.com	salesforce
salesforce often refers to the sales cloud crm or force.com cloud platform products that salesforce.com an enterprise cloud computing company offers

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	svg	vml
i m interested in finding a browser compatibility table that lists the parts of svg vml supported by each version of opera safari google-chrome firefox and internet explorer also konqueror would be nice in the vein of quirksmode

5920985
firefox	safari
the information in the first link seems to clash with libraries like raphael which claim to fully support animations in firefox 3.0+ and safari 3.0+ whilst the link suggests that the animation module isn t implemented till later versions for those two browsers

5920985
svg	vml
the second link simply doesn t go far back enough for me to be able to draw conclusions about which features of svg vml i can use to ensure compatibility with older browsers

5920985
svg	vml
as ie doesn t support svg i m interested in finding out which parts of vml the are supported in the different versions of ie

5920993
hide	show
i ve got this setup but it toggles on the onclick action which means selecting yes twice show and hide the input field

5920995

inside your service you can then leverage declarative security via the attribute you can get the custom iprincipal from thread.currentprincipal and alternatively you can also get the custom iidentity from servicesecuritycontext.current.primaryidentity

5921175
width	height
board s where all action takes it place width and height should be fixed 640 pixels 480 pixels

5921175
width	height
is there any way to make board s width and height like 640 480 but main windows width and height - as much as board s width and height are correct

5921220
ant	maven
i m following steps as mentioned in chapter 2 of java presistence with hibernate only diff is i m maven using instead of ant

5921231
post	get
if it becomes too long you may use post instead of get

5921272
appdata	denied
error cs0016 could not write to output file c users adam speight appdata local temp 0c2jg3wu.dll -- access is denied

5921308
stdout	stderr
it s better to use popen and construct the command string to redirect appropriately if you would like to redirect stdout and stderr from command.exe into somefile.txt

5921358
rel	src
your a html should have two attributes let s say data-imgsrc and data-gallery and remove the a s rel attribute and the img s src attribute like this

5921389
google-chrome	safari
above will remove outline border in google-chrome and safari browsers on form element focus

5921391
outputstream	inputstream
or if you re writing it to some file by filewriter then you should rather be using inputstream outputstream from the beginning on without converting it to string first

5921403
multiplying	modulo
also instead of dividing you should multiplying by the multiplicative inverse of p modulo the appropriate value

5921414
post	get
you can use an httpmodule that intercepts each and every get post and then inside the httpmodule you can check whether the request.url is an aspx or not

5921436
sorting	filtering
according the person who answered the entitydatasource has more features sorting filtering .

5921457
int	double
there was a call to the int int constructor which i hadn t noticed yet it compiled and ran but invoked the double double version quite properly causing an exception handler i had written to be thrown

5921480
setinterval	settimeout
i find that creating a simple function and calling your code through the function via setinterval instead of settimeout

5921488
qgraphicsview	qwidget
qgraphicsview is derived from qwidget

5921492
int	double
since you can convert an int to a double without losing any information the java language performs this invisibly

5921496
int	double
in methods overloading the most specific method is called so if you have foo int int and foo double double and you call foo 1 2 then foo int int will be called

5921496
int	double
but since 1 2 may be double as well if you don t have foo int int foo double double will be called

5921500
width	height
because the triangles are equal sided then giving the grid a width of 17 will indeed cause the height to become 17 as well which of course is not enough for two equal height triangles

5921533
imperative	declarative
it may well be overkill but it is also a more functional solution since regular expressions are declarative while substring stuff is more imperative

5921550
post	get
i know when selecting records this way it is possible to get number of records through count p.id for example but i didn t discover how to set offset how many records skip from the beginning and limit how many records return at all according to unique post id

5921575
printf	strlen
you also need to because you are using strlen and because you are using printf .

5921589
width	height
with sizetocontent widthandheight the height will be 17 as you you set the grid s width to 17

5921589
width	height
this way the width and the height of the buttons will be equal

5921610
jpql	hql
the expressivity of querydsl is comparable to hql jpql

5921630
min	max
better solution say your table has the usual primary key auto-increment field generate a rendom number between min id and max id and select the closest id

5921664
ldd	otool
a look into the plpython library seems to confirm that otool sort of does on the mac what ldd does on linux

5921683
submit	submission
your submission handler doesn t work for existing forms unless you specifiy an extra submit handler

5921685
public	protected
both kinds of methods have full access to the class internals protected and private sections as well of course as access to the class public interface

5921685
public	protected
in c++ as we have seen previously this is done by using different access levels public protected and private and granting access to the non- public levels to a restricted portion of the code

5921694

5928340
x86	64bit
now just because the cpu supports it doesn t mean the os supports it that s where you have either 64bit os or 32-bit os 32-bit is also known as x86 there s small technical differences in the x86 refers to the cpu instruction set but for most common usage x86 and 32-bit are interchangeable

5928349
int	chars
is there any c++ container that can store 2 or more types of values such as int and chars

5928349
int	chars
the deck has to consist of both int and chars

5928354
vim	emacs
i know a lot of people are having a lot of luck using emacs or vim along with ant scripts for building projects

5928368
int	chars
i m assuming that you need a container which is able to store either int or chars

5928368
int	chars
the contents of the chars and the int field in the union then occupy the same memory slots

5928368
int	chars
well the int uses more slots since chars are usually only one byte

5928368
int	chars
it is then up to you to set the type field of the struct to say c if you store a chars and to say i to store an int and then access the contents of the struct using the chars or the int field depending on the value of type

the problem is that if you override a predefined properties of an interface it doesn t get changed in the interfaces that inherited from it at least in firefox

5928408
post	get
i looks like you are reading get from php and sending post

5928408

button	checkbox
now on server side i want to check if the checkbox is checked or not on submit button click event

5928444
vbscript	jscript
the example is in vbscript but it should be easy to implement the same approach with jscript

5928446
google-chrome	firefox
the main symptom is that the servlets do not see the session data when seeing jsps in google-chrome and firefox

5928446
google-chrome	firefox

children	parent
that is to say a parent class has no knowledge of the functions and properties that its children may choose to declare so as a result the following code will not work

5928469
post	get
in theory you could stream the assembler in a request to file call something external to assemble run it get results somehow and post it back

5928469
16-bit	64bit
in windows 64bit you d also need to run both assembler and result in a dosbox that emulates 16-bit assembler since 16-bit programs don t work in long mode

5928494
width	height
can i override the constructor of the cell so that i can pass in the width and height of the cell that i want

n-gram	words
bigrams are usually constructed by combining two consecutive words and using them as the key so forth for trigrams and n-gram

5928932
bash	subshell
in the fragment ps -o pid ppid cmd it s obvious that nothing can influence the parent shell so there s an optimization in bash that makes it not fork a separate process for the subshell

5928934
getter	setter
each class should have appropriate private fields getter and setter

5928955

hash	salt
if all accounts in the system use the same salt an attacker can brute-force calculate hash for that salt and break into all accounts with just one computational run

5929284
hash	salt
if you are not using a random salt then you don t make it more difficult for the attacker to attack your hash if they get their hand on the salt

5929364
next	except
i noticed on windows xp that the group box has 1-pixel gray lines but on windows 7 there is a 3d effect created by having a gray line next to a white line the white line on the interior except on the bottom where it s below the gray line

5929382
dbcontext	objectcontext
once you execute both queries entity framework should ensure that navigation properties are correctly filled with related entities but this works only when lazy loading is turned off but entities are tracked by context well i never tried this with dbcontext api but it worked with objectcontext api

5929389
sorting	filtering
however i was running into an issue with sorting so i looked into using and added jquery s filtering method before the sort which makes sense

5929427
width	height
you might need to tweek it a bit so that you get the width height of the view

5929427
width	height
i m inflating layouts and specify the width height when i layout the code

5929436
postgresql	mysql
can be installed as multi-headed fully redundant system using zeo and relstorage zodb encapsulation in a rdbms datastore backend like mysql postgresql or oracle

5929456
google-chrome	safari
this does however work in safari but not google-chrome on a mac which appears to not care about signed unsigned sandbox mixing or something

5929476
filtering	grouping
having is for post aggregate eg after grouping by filtering

5929491
folder	directory
in this directory there are folder according to the phones language

5929510
post	get
i m coding a forum system and i m trying to get the last post in a topic

5929526
shadowing	named
secondly you re shadowing your ivars in your init method by declaring local variables with the same named as your ivars

5929528
cassini	iis
when i use the default server in visual studio 2010 not sure if this is cassini or iis

5929592
subtract	add
but now we subtract too much and need to add back the multiples of 3 5 7 again

5929604
put	get
you could put it in main.cpp to get started but it would be more usual to put it in a separate gui.cpp .

5929620
children	parent
i have a hierirachy of my own object classes - a bit like the components on a form really in that any of them can have children and a parent

5929624
accessor	properties
all the code is doing is creating a separate name for the instance variable and the properties accessor

5929624
shadowing	named
also as jer pointed out you have an issue in your code sample with shadowing of your declared instance variables - in your init method you are creating new variables with the same named as your instance variables

5929689
subclass	abstract-class
the idea being that i could instantiate a presenter for a particular view with both classes relying on useful methods defined in the abstract base classes yet both knowing exactly what subclass of the counterpart abstract-class is in use

5929699
post	get
now to retrieve it and save it in your db you have to get it from the post variable

5929726
listview	gridview
in wpf if you use a listview control with the view set to a gridview the default foreground color of the items are dark blue

5929727
maven	m2e
maven scm handler for subclipse 0.12.0 from m2e extra s site sorry i would give the url but my new account doesn t have enough rep

5929752
implements	extends
update my thread is a worker thread it implements runnable and the data needs to ne send to a different class that extends activity

5929760
inherited	subclassing
one of the coolest features i ve seen in help viewers is the ability to hide inherited members so you can focus on only what that particular subclassing offers

5929770
submit	submission
manually submit the form elements that have changed in either a manual jquery call either through submission the data via jquery via json or explicitly passing in the form values

5929835
uilabel	nsstring
i know you can draw just the nsstring into a context easily but i want to retain the text size color and word wrap style of the uilabel

5929857
uiview	subviews
if by z-index you are referring to the order of subviews in a uiview each subviews has its own unique z index so you d have to create a new view for each image

5929865
folder	directory
if i m not wrong to create or delete a file from a directory you either need write permissions on that folder or write permission on that file in case you re modifying it

5929906
getter	setter
i created custom class witch have two fields string _name string _type and have getter and setter for these fields

5929918

works for me in firefox google-chrome ie9 safari

5930071
postgresql	mysql
i m looking at the cost of using mysql commercially and have decided for the time being that i may be able to use postgresql instead

5930071
postgresql	mysql
also has anyone here used both postgresql and mysql and decided to go with one over the other and if so why did you make the decision you did

5930100
pdcurses	ncurses
hey so i m trying to get addstr in the pdcurses library to work windows ncurses with the preferred string class so i made the function the following string_to_80char function which is supposed to take a string and return an 80 character long char array the number of characters fit on one line in the console since this is the only parameter addstr seems to accept.

5930117
width	height
i have a php script where i want to display some images inside a div but there are some restrictions regarding the max width and height

5930117
width	height
for example an image may have width 1000px and height 600px but the max width and height of the image should not be over 500 px in order to fit in the div

5930117
width	height
so i want to convert the dimensions so that the image fits in the div but the ratio between width and height remains the same

5930157
innodb	myisam
myisam supports full text search whilst innodb does not thus you use myisam for the table where you will use full-text search

5930166
unsigned	short
i ve read up on bitwise operations but i m still confused on how to deal with signed and unsigned and values that are larger or smaller that a short s range they are passed in as two ints

5930311
textview	imageview
making them very much alike compared to using textview imageview etc

5930337
range	max
range k max does not include max so you re really checking up to and including 998 while 999 is a multiple of 3

5930351
plone	buildout
for example the plone team has a good article running buildout on windows referencing their own script bin instance.exe

5930376
postgresql	mysql
this behavior is observed on ubuntu 11.04 any 3.0.x rails version 3.1.0.beta1 devise 1.3.1 and 1.3.4 mysql postgresql sqlite drivers

5930393
post	get
i m trying to provide users of my site with postage calculator and to do so need to pull out data from australian post api but what is returned dosen t look anything like what get at australian post website calculator at

destination_postcode 0800 country au weight 600 service_type standard length 300 width 300 height 200 quantity 1

5930407
daemons	systemd
in practice this isn t a huge concern as best practices dictate using a deployment systemd like capistrano where a rule can easily be added to bounce the daemons on deploy

5930409
mouseleave	mouseenter
you just need to add the mouseenter mouseleave set the visual state of the control accordingly

5930425
google-chrome	firefox

and only installing my swapbuffers minifilter through this inf file i received

5930478
min	max
i bind progressbar to a class by means of several properties min max value all oneway bindings obviously

5930478
min	max
min 0 max 100 still has the lack of the glow

5930478
min	max
min 0 max 10 had the glow come back in its full vigor

5930523
put	get
the sql membership provider utilizes an auto generated stored procedure to put data into the membership user instance returned so just adding the attributes in the table will not be sufficient to get the attribute values to your application

5930540
internationalization	translation
internationalization of the interface is easy but the 1500+ exercices will not all be translation before a long time

5930555
google-chrome	safari
i ve taken it out of the page above but the problem version can be seen here - it works fine in google-chrome but breaks horribly in safari

5930564
google-chrome	safari
it could be an issue of latency firebug or safari google-chrome inspector tools will show this some issue in the javascript that is slowing down the event loop this is unlikely but possible you can step through the code in a js debugger or it could be due to the performance of the web server

5930564
thin	webrick
if you re running webrick then all bets are off in terms of performance but it is easy to solve by installing mongrel or thin

5930571
postgresql	mysql
plus postgresql tends to find much better query plans than mysql

5930634
uitextfield	uitoolbar
my guess is that it s just a uitextfield that is put inside a uitoolbar

5930686
packets	multicast
what percent of udp multicast packets should i expect to be dropped lost in this setup

5930696
rtl	vhdl
i am working with mentor fpga doing rtl design with moduleware and vhdl

5930734
post	get
and also we can do the same with just 2 actions because we can use an if inside create_item for checking if the request is get or post so we are combining display_item with store_item

5930751
fputs	gets
fputs is not a dangerous function unlike gets which is dangerous

5930754
int	chars
chars is an int type

5930756
yacc	bison
for the 3. you should study bison or yacc lex and or any other grammar-parsers compiler-compilers

5930761
int	chars
this chars gets automatically promoted to an int in the expression this always happens with chars s in expressions in c and then this int is attempted to change to a

5930762
requestfactory	gwt
answered something similar here - smartgwt datasource with gwt requestfactory etc

5930807
powerpc	i386
-dmacosx -arch i386 -arch powerpc .

5930827
post	get
the pattern is to get a blank form modify the contents of the form then post that to the server which then sends a redirect to another page which is a get perhaps to a page saying form submitted successfully

5930827
post	get
with that redirect however they re on that results page via a safe get which will not result in a double post

5930829
stateless	stateful
that http is stateless and what is assumed while writing the code you re programming as if the application was stateful

5930886
ffmpeg	handbrake	folder	directory
i have a folder called media in the root of my c what i want to do is that when i copy some form of video media ex .mov file to that folder that it would detect the copy once completed fire handbrake or ffmpeg via the command line and encode pushing to another directory under media such as encoded totally automated so that i don t even need to think about encoding video

5930897
ubuntu	centos
this following code always throwing same error it seems to be working in ubuntu but not in fedora centos

5930923
postgresql	mysql
pdo is highly recommended though as you could later change from using mysql to postgresql if needed without changing all of your db queries

5930930
button	right-align
the button is right-align and the text items are left-aligned one after the other as shown

5930930
button	right-align
the closest i ve got which succesfully truncates the main text results in the n always being right-align next to the button even when the main text is short enough to fit

5930991
integer	unsigned
to get a guaranteed at least 64-bit integer you need unsigned long long

5931003
passenger	thin	passenger	unicorn	thin	unicorn
i m sure most experienced ruby devs use something else like thin mongrel unicorn pow passenger etc.

5931018
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie9 all works well but in ie compatibility mode the element only rotates once first mouseenter then never again until page refresh

5931018
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave works just fine without the rotate

5931058
salt	md5
if yes use rand and store it....or if you want letters too use something like md5 time + salt

5931112
hash	md5
this assumes you re using an md5 hash password which is 32 in length

5931185
rmdir	mkdir
back in the days of 7th edition or version 7 unix there were no system calls mkdir 2 and rmdir 2

5931185
rmdir	mkdir
sections 2 and 3 are devoid of mkdir 2 and rmdir 2

5931185
rmdir	mkdir
nowadays the mkdir 2 and rmdir 2 system calls are standard and permit any user to create and remove directories preserving the correct semantics

5931185
unix	bsd
this is doubly true since symbolic links were introduced - they were not in 7th edition unix but were in the bsd versions of unix from quite early on

5931210
accessor	properties
while the usual mantra is don t use public fields use accessor or properties i noticed that properties are not yet supported widely across all browsers ie

5931212
rss	feed
will monitor an rss or atom feed and

5931233
implements	extends
if you want a different behaviour you could implements and extends arrayobject however

5931266
serializable	deserialization
the serializable method works correctly but the deserialization doesnt seem to be working

5931272
post	get	post	put	put	get
put simply they are attacks which trick administrators into visiting a certain url by get or post request

5931336
prop	each	getter	setter
there is no private keyword in javascript so wrapping each publicly-accessible prop in a getter setter method pair would be overkill

5931343
ienumerable	ilist
another problem with this design is exposing a collection through the most derived type - list as opposed to ienumerable or ilist

5931353
for-loop	arrays
later on i add data from xmllist to arrays which then i m looping in for-loop

5931462
post	get
as far as getting started with the basics there is plenty of other post around that will get to this point but for the combobox design the above should help

5931487
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am using the jquery ui.layout plugin and on osx in google-chrome firefox and safari all is hunky dory

5931487
google-chrome	firefox
however on windows 7 on firefox google-chrome and ie8 i am getting the following

5931489
getter	setter
you need to provide normal getter and setter methods

5931489
getter	setter
el won t access properties by fields it will access them by getter only and mutate them by setter only

5931498
pull	push
since web by design doesn t support push but instead pull for data ajax is the way that makes the most sense

5931501
x509	pkcs#1
there s sample code there for producing a pkcs#1 rsa public key from an openssh public key which is slightly different from jakub s solution which produces an x509 public key

5931569
typedef	struct
the use of struct there is just for backwards compatibility with c in which declaring would declare a type named struct foo and foo would only be a valid type name if you then used typedef struct foo foo

5931570
int	chars
so for example the chars 9 will be turned into the int 9

5931590
post	get
not a complete answer but you can merge this blog post with os.system to run handbrake and get a working system

5931600
titlebar	window
edit is there a way to do this while retaining the titlebar window management buttons etc

5931606
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing it in firefox 4 and google-chrome

5931623
int	chars
an unsigned chars is just an 8-bit int type that can take values between 0 and 255 and a signed chars can take values between -127 and 128

5931623
int	chars
in the actual machine code there is no real difference except one when you do a right shift on a signed type using be it chars short or int it is carried out as an arithmetical shift meaning for negative values which have a 1 as msb a 1 is shifted in instead of a 0 and the above code will not work as expected

5931644
g++	gcc
you don t need either or to get the original code to compile or at least i don t on macos x 10.6.7 with gcc g++ 4.6.0

5931654
django	web.py	flask	django	flask	web.py
i d advocate python and one of the many web frameworks flask django web.py etc. as the syntax is very readable and is quite simple to modify

5931704
hbase	voltdb
i was thinking this may be the perfect application for a non-relation nosql database such as apache cassandra or hadoop hbase column family mongodb document voltdb community edn or mysql

5931748
client-side	server-side
alternatively consider caching your pages beginning with client-side http caching and considering server-side caching later

5931807
post	get
since the uid is different for each post i m trying to get the php code to parse and remove this via mysql

5931808
postgresql	mysql
depends because there is one big limitation from the rdbms which affects all databases including mysql postgresql etc.

5931811
ddms	adb
once the activity is running you can monitor the activity s log output from logcat using ddms or adb

5931819
int	chars
signed chars chars and unsigned chars are all int types

5931849
rss	feed
i m pulling some rss feed in from youtube which have invalid utf8

5931884
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in the html with embedded css below the ls the ts and the cs in line title and cell are aligned when displayed with google-chrome with firefox and with safari

arduino	avr-gcc
while i don t know about the atxmega the 8-bit avr chips like the atmega328 used on the newer arduino use the avr-gcc compiler

5931887
arduino	avr-gcc
the arduino ide uses avr-gcc and avr libc library in the backend

5931887
arduino	avr-gcc
i wrote a blog post to try and give more in-depth details on the avr arduino and avr-gcc

5931959
post	get
3 third way i get the idea from paypal api which is the version is not in the url but in the post parameter

5931979
std	ostream
or preface ifstream and ostream with std

5932031
width	height
i ll refer to rectangles using x y width height

nsstring	nsxmlparser
in void parser nsxmlparser parser didendelement nsstring elementname namespaceuri nsstring namespaceuri qualifiedname nsstring qname

5932067
post	get	post	put	put	get
to get around this i ve made a simple class for reading get post put delete request arguments

5932067
post	get	post	put	put	get
this class will parse the put delete params and support get post as well

5932120
rss	feed
right now i have a google site and the rss feed subscription works through feedburner

5932201
width	height
i want to create an inline-block that will take on some unknown width and height

5932203
firefox	safari
this code works perfectly for me tested in firefox and safari but should work for all

5932323
post	get
i used post not get but still data seems to get transmitted by the url

5932347
inject	interceptor
inject also has additional cdi-specific capabilities scopes interceptor etc. but those capabilities incur extra overhead

5932373
exponent	addition
a float at its highest limits binary exponent of 127 does not have sufficient precision 23 bits to show a difference of the largest possible char 127 7 bits and so overflow is not possible since addition will have no effect a precision of 127-7 120 would be required

5932379
width	height
ids #foo #zoo #soo #moo each id has different height width

5932379
width	height
if drag drop elements parent are swappable and different suppose drag_id.parentid #foo drop_id.parentid #zoo then swap it s height width to each other

5932381
width	height
also it looks as if it does something with the width height as well

5932394
htmlgenericcontrol	onclientclick
i don t think you can bind an onclientclick event to htmlgenericcontrol

5932404
post	get
an ajax request is in almost all implementations you are likely to encounter a post or get request

5932409
qpushbutton	qwidget
no matching function for call to qpushbutton qpushbutton qstring qwidget

5932412
post	get
i ve seen remy sharp s post on audio sprites but a i wasn t able to get it to work for me and b i would prefer to stay away from a library dependency

5932449
pthreads	fork
the linux thread is also know as lightweight processes which is not generated by an fork call but rather the pthreads call

5932472
metaphone	soundex
as well as soundex which was developed as far back as 1918 there are also metaphone and double metaphone which were developed in the 1990s and 2000s respectively specifically to be be improvements over soundex

5932515
metaphone	soundex
metaphone fundamentally improves on the soundex algorithm by using information about variations and inconsistencies in english spelling and pronunciation to produce a more accurate encoding which does a better job of matching words and names which sound similar

5932517
plone	buildout
buildout and restarted plone but i didn t find the theme on the addon page

5932570
rss	feed
part of my program parses and rss feed depending on which feed was chosen from a tableview

5932621
jsf	seam
i am a jsf developer and recently heard about the seam framework but i don t know about it and what its benefits are

5932622
onresume	onpause
please write progress dialog code in onpause instead of onresume

5932651
sorting	filtering
you can use entitydatasource only if you are using entity framework for data access - it uses capabilities of underlying framework to support features such sorting filtering etc

5932659
jsf	seam
seam is a jboss framework that links jsf to their hibernate orm persistence technology

5932677
getter	setter
is foo guaranted to be nil before the first setter or getter call

5932683
portrait	landscape
i then found the great ipad css layout with landscape portrait modes demo

5932689
integer	unsigned
i d like to take a value with an unsigned integer representation and somehow using floating point operations perform a rotate right shift bitwise operation

5932697
scrollable	panels
how to get the seen user region of the picturebox with autosize mode in the scrollable panels

5932726
jsf	seam
seam tries to bridge some of the gaps between jsf and ejb

5932726
jsf	seam
so if you already know and like jsf and know and like either hibernate and or jpa then i d say you re off on a good fit to like what seam has to offer

5932773
int	chars
int index chars abc int size

5932844
pcm	music
the sample app then saves this pcm data to a file but you can do anything you want with the data instead queue it up for playback dsp analysis music visualization custom compression network transmission etc.

5932880
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried mashappslabs s solution mouseenter mouseleave and i tried t.j

5932883
udp	tcp
what examples do you know - of protocols initially handshake in udp then conversing in tcp

5932925
public	protected
initializing public protected members of base class inside a derived class constructor is not allowed by current standard

5932928
wxruby	fxruby
secondly do i have to create a windows interface using fxruby or wxruby to work with it

5932936
mouseleave	mouseenter
you may know that hover is basically just a combination of mouseenter and mouseleave which are ie-specific events but jquery emulates them on browsers that don t provide them

5932936
mouseleave	mouseenter
but mouseenter and mouseleave don t bubble

5932936
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
the related and not ie-specific mouseover and mouseout events bubble though so this looks like it might be is a bug in the mouseenter mouseleave emulation that s specific to delegated handling

5933011
floating-point	integer
hope that the hardware has some floating-point operations that operate on those bits the same way as the integer operations that sha256 uses

5933011
int	double
stuff your int into a floating-point variable with more bits put an int32 into a double which can hold 53 bits without losing precision and then implement the rotate-right operation using mathematical operations

5933011
multiplication	modulo
shl drops any bits that fall off the upper end which we can emulate by doing the multiplication modulo 2 b

5933011
floating-point	integer
it seems unlikely but not impossible -- adding two floating-point numbers with different exponents would require fast shift operations inside the fp hardware even if the integer hardware doesn t have fast shifts

5933016

execvp	fork
read this so question to see the difference between fork execvp and system

5933179
short	base
in short while the objects are constructed the deriveda ones are registering themselves in a static vector in base which means they are accessible in derivedb once you are calling process on derivedb types

5933195
setcontentview	findviewbyid
txtothermatches is probably null because it doesn t exist in the current view.when you use findviewbyid the view must be in the contentview you ve set with setcontentview or added later tot the view

5933291
post	get
i m not at my development computer at the moment but i ll post some helpful links when i get there in a few hours

5936014

5937771
setinterval	settimeout
2 you re setting all the settimeout functions at the same time in the inner call you probably want to call a setinterval and have that increment i

5937777
for-loop	loops
the reasoning is that the for-loop doesn t actually give you the value of i within loops only the address in which to access it

5937796
onchange	onkeydown
i would just add an onchange or onkeydown method to each text box and then write a method in javascript to update only that field

5937853

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you will be able to use uinavigationcontroller with uitabbarcontroller

5937996
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in addition if you drag table view controller to view controller inside the navigation controller they are exchanged and you can use uinavigationcontroller + uitableview + uitabbarcontroller

5938035
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged	inotifycollectionchanged	icollectionview	inotifypropertychanged	icollectionview
based on what you have said it sounds like you might want to review data binding and how you can leverage the inotifypropertychanged inotifycollectionchanged and icollectionview interfaces to enable two-way communication between your views and view models

5938060
int	double
so now the method function will run only for int and double

5938125

5938262
screens	hdpi
the nexus s and galaxy tab both have hdpi screens

5938262

i never needed to play a lot with rss but now i have a project to do and i wonder if it is possible to pull an rss feed of all the posts for a certain blog.

5938470
hide	show
you create the desired formatting in two separate sections then use a parameter to hide show the desired section

5938481
put	get
i get that you might want the model to be auto-generated from an orm but you can still put the viewmodel stuff in another file via a partial class and doing this avoids the considerable overhead of maintaining a viewmodel for every model

5938569
rss	feed
i am developing an iphone app in which i am extracting rss feed and then parsing them.my code is as bellow

5938664
rsa	dsa
trying pyopenssl i was able to generate the private pem serialization for rsa and dsa keys bu there is no crypto.dump_publickey method in pyopenssl

5938664
rsa	dsa
i am looking for suggestion of how to generate the pem serialization for rsa and dsa keys

5938664
rsa	dsa
i was already using twisted.conch so i solved this problem by manually generating a dsa rsa key using pycrypto and then initializing a twisted.conch.ssh.key.key using this key

5938976
uilabel	uibutton
for each image view i am adding a uibutton and a uilabel

5938986
super	extends
when extends it your derived class will need to call a specific constructor in its super class bufferedimage

5938991
implements	extends
you must implements one or more of the existing constructors for the class you are extends

5939001
superclass	subclassing
in a similar fashion if you create a subclassing for bufferedimage it cannot interface with it s superclass without satisfying the initialization requirements

5939018
superclass	subclassing
when extending a class the subclassing must eventually call some constructor of the superclass whether directly or chaining through other constructors it defines which ultimately call a constructor of the superclass

5939018
super	implements
how you obtain the parameters is often done by implements a constructor with the same parameters then passing them on with super

5939022
client-side	server-side
you re confusing server-side with client-side scripting

5939071
filtering	grouping
if it is not really a combination of all values that you want to filtering grouping on but the grouping conditions that determine the value of max depend directly on datetime

that s why salt was invented -- it creates always different hash

5939077
unsigned	short
where all struct members were of type unsigned short

5939118
int	chars
it now looks for an int followed by a space or one of these chars . â d and that followed by decimal minutes

5939123
crypt	hash
this scheme uses the operating system s crypt 3 hash function

5939123
hash	md5
it normally produces the traditional unix-style 13 character hash but on systems with glibc2 it can also generate the more secure 34-byte md5 hash

5939123
hash	md5
this scheme simply takes the md5 hash of the password and stores it in base64 encoded form

5939123
salt	md5
this improves on the basic md5 scheme by adding salt random data which means that there are many possible representations of a given plaintext password

5939166
post	get
the first 2 methods will receive to both get and post requests the 3rd will only respond to post requests

5939173
ati	nvidia
also note that in the case of opencl the actual compilation process is handled by the vendor i believe it happens in the video driver so it may be worthwhile to have a look at the driver documentation and opencl kits from your vendor nvidia ati intel

i have code to do this in the mouseup and mousedown event handlers

5939262
mouseup	mousedown
but why would mouseup work but mousedown not

5939273

you could provide those values in every get or post request the user sends to the server but that s not a really good idea i think

5939333
inherited	properties
to stay dry don t repeat yourself you can inherited one view model from the other and add the additional properties

5939341
hide	show
i wnat to hide that red border for the initial state but show it when the user hits the send button if there is a missing field marked as required

5939351
post	get
this would obviously only work if you re only doing a get request for post and further requirements look into curl

5939373
integer	unsigned
assuming a language-agnostic setup in which the rand function has a flawless implementation and returns a very large let s say 128 bits strong random unsigned integer i should have fairly low chances of getting the same number twice considering the period of the rng would be astronomically huge

5939378
opera	firefox
you can see the behavior in this simple testcase in ie and firefox and opera

5939418

5939694
kerberos	ntlm
my understanding is that java 6 running on windows has built-in support for spnego but it seems that the java implementation does not attempt ntlm authentication in the event kerberos authentication is not possible

kerberos	ntlm
wcf is configured for spnego authentication kerberos and ntlm

5939714
cpu	processors
even on say x86 processors differences in instruction set # cores cache sizes cpu vendor model generation etc

i have a couple of buttons inside a div with a specific width and i am facing a problem where the buttons are being rendered differently in firefox vs google-chrome and safari

5939812
client-side	server-side
maintaining the focus client-side will be much easier than trying to force it through the server-side

5939827
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i assumed one could simply use objectoutputstream to save all the loaded plugins to file and later read these with objectinputstream

5939839
post	get
i can t get a working set of results - if you could post some dummy data that gives results that would help

5939839

nsstring	nsdata
if your dictionary consists of a limited number of classes specifically nsdata nsstring nsarray nsdictionary nsdate and nsnumber you can use nspropertylistserialization in particular the method

5939935
post	get
the problem is that the click is actually performing a postback using javascript with the limitations of php and curl you will need to inspect the http headers get post and cookies being sent by the browser and emulate them

5939961
typedef	struct
my interpretation is that the typedef struct is creating an alias to an unnamed type and that it thus can t be used as a template type parameter

5939961
typedef	struct
finally in closing i have to ask is there a reason you can t name the struct instead of typedef ing it

5939969
rss	feed
i am working on a rss feed app that contains the title and the description in tamil language

this code is being used to given a min and max longitude latitude a square that contains a set of points determine the maximum zoom level on google maps that will still display all of those points

5939985
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram always seem to better describe a database

5939990
public	protected
i ve looked into method_exists but that s just not good enough even if i can filter out all closures and global functions because it will return true for private and protected methods as well as public

5940019
width	height
just size constrain your label to the width you need and the height will be calculated for you based on other attributes like font and font size

5940078
post	get
3 finally the post action to get and persist the order

5940089
post	get
the content is changed checking some variable from the get post method for each condition i load the page requested

5940093

you might want to look at extends urlclassloader or implements something similar to it

5940106
width	height
is there a simple way i can loop through the repeater items and get all the variables x y width height of a specific project

5940132
firefox	safari
this happens in safari and firefox

5940139
firefox	safari
safari seems to ignore the parent s padding when absolutely positioning a child but firefox and ie seem to take the padding into account and start from that offset

5940185
inherited	properties
the master name used in your designer file will be pulled from your .master file s inherited properties

5940186

wan	lan
it depends on the size of data the rate you going to send it the network lan or wan and many other factors

5940212
abstract-class	superclass	superclass	subclassing

md5 hash always contains 16 bytes regardless of the input size

5940311
post	get
then in your post action just get the product object and save it to database

5940378
children	parent
if you are forking a single program to create children and only the parent and the children will use the memory segment just be sure to map it before you fork

5940378
children	parent
the children will automatically inherit the mapping from their parent and there s no need to use a fixed address

5940378
boost	stl
if you aren t then the first thing to consider is whether you really need to use raw stl containers instead of the boost interprocess containers

5940378
boost	stl
that you re already using boost interprocess to allocate the shared memory segment suggests you don t have any problem using boost so the only advantage i can think of to using stl containers would be so you don t have to port existing code

5940378
x86	64bit
i suggest at least 2 48 since current 64bit x86 processors don t each beyond that range despite pointers being 64bit you can only plug in as much ram as allowed by 48-bits still a ton at the time of this writing

5940380
express	node.js

in the end settimeout setinterval is probably fine if it works properly

5940456
put	get
however when i put the following into the manifest i get the same error

5940467
post	get
update i have figured out that the first action method is called but because it returns a view the view engine is calling the podform action method as a post rather than as a get which is triggering the submit logic

5940476
bmp	png
the bmp format has size information and png format has size information for each chunk

5940477
rss	feed
i have a html output i m pulling from a rss feed it is somethig like this

5940477
src	attr
the problem is that i only need the attr src of the iframe tag is there a way to get it with php

5940532
rss	feed
this requires your rss feed to be very consistent though if the some text part were to contain marks this would mess up and you d get a wrong string

5940532
rss	feed
you could look through the array for everything starting with http or www to work around errors but again it requires a very consistent rss feed so you have to judge for you self if this would do the job good enough

5940536
hash	md5
the reverse it not necessarily true - if two files have the same md5 hash they could have different contents though the probability of this is very low

5940536
hash	md5
however it should be noted that for collisions have been intentionally created for md5 hash so the cryptographic security of md5 is considered broken

5940536
hash	md5
but since there are other hash algorithms available they should be used instead of md5 if you have the option

5940570
factors	mean
that may mean that it s not an access-specific issue but rather that the tables in your database have something in common with the table in this post and that common factors is what is preventing the tableadapter from working as it should

5940571
dbi	carp
in this case i ve used cgi for html generation cgi carp for outputing error messages to the browser this can help with debugging and dbi for using databases

i have a parent type and there are some children types inheriting from it

5940624
children	parent
i want to make sure there is only one instance of the parent and also for all the children types

width	height
the width and height can be anything but you do have to tell it something

5940652

5940806
metaclass	subclassing
i m riffing from the information here metaclass not being called in subclassing

5940840

you could use code coverage tools like php_codecoverage which is based on xdebug s statement coverage functionality or unit testing software like phpunit or simpletest which have code coverage integrated

5940906
client-side	server-side
receiving a combination of cursor timeouts client-side and server-side cursor not found

5940907
boost	stl
the recommended alternative to stl containers holding polymorphic pointers is the boost pointer container library

5940950
pull	push
in the post-receive git pull on the working directory update the version.txt as needed and commit and push

5940951
ati	nvidia
there are further libraries to support gpgpu general purpose gpu programming such as opencl nvidia s cuda or ati s stream

5940955
int	chars
you can increment a chars as you can increment an int

5940956

int	chars
the string chars c int n constructor gives you back a string with the chars c repeated n times

5941054
prepare	execute
if this is something you need to execute more than once you might want to use a prepare statement

5941057
int	chars
you can convert an int to a chars like so

5941057
int	chars	int	double
you can use an if statement to check if your int exceeded z s value and if so subtract z s value from your int to find out what s the difference which you can use to write the double chars

5941065
put	get
p.s i couldn t get vb style quotes to work so put in the c# one

5941067
post	get
so you re basically asking how to get json data by a post request

5941084
hide	show
i d rename the two divs to cardiv2 and cardiv3 and then use different logic to hide or show

5941089
hash	md5
for example on this intel i7 laptop i have generating 999999 md5 hash from microtime takes roughly about 4 seconds and doing same thing with random numbers is second faster not taking a seeding of rand into account

5941105
hide	show
i can then use jquery to show and hide the buttons when the item is hovered

5941163
put	get
the nice thing is that you can use the cache provider with just a few lines of code to set up then call put and get for serializable key value pairs

5941165
post	get
you file is not uploaded until you do a post back it sounds like your only browsing to the file and then trying to get a thumbnail before you post back upload the image

5941213
jbox2d	andengine
andengine is using that implementation instead of jbox2d and they re happy they switched to that version

5941226
translation	localization
the other option i have seen is to store the translation in the database and write a custom resourceprovider so that the built-in localization methods can be used whilst abstracting the actual implementation in this case a database

5951577
width	height
if you are asking about the preview width and height then yes it depends on the orientation

children	parent
there are a couple reasons to do this but one good one is that you can then also issue batch commands for parent and children at once and achieve a type of consistent transaction

5951887
children	parent
to differentiate between parent and children you can either add an attribute or use the rowkey perhaps

5951887
children	parent
the only trick to this and the model you already ahve is that if the parent and children are not the same clr type you will have issues with serialization in wcf dataservices

5951887
children	parent
anyhow use the same pk for both children and parent

5951887
children	parent
then when you search pk ranges you will always get parent and children returned at once you can discriminate with a where clause predicate if you wish

5951888
superclass	subclassing
if your subclassing overrides method from superclass and you reference subclassing instance using pointer to superclass then subclassing method will get called

5952733
public	protected
furthermore the reflection does not allow you to convert a private method to a protected or public method

5953015
post	get
this post redirect get design pattern is typically used with web forms to help with book marking

5953069
antivirus	norton
norton is extreme pain but most browsers and or antivirus applications will at least warn the user when he attempts to download an executable

5953084
subobject	instances
however since django thinks i want real inheritance whenever i delete an instances of patch it ends up going through all its subobject the rows in examplecompatch that link to it which means tests that have no relation whatsoever to examplecompatch may now need to create the db view manually if they need to delete a row from the patch table

5953088
width	height
it sets the width but when it s vertical you need to set the height

5953099

integer	unsigned
4. as you see i can still print out the integer as unsigned type if i use the u specifier and it will print me the value 2147483650

5953224
integer	unsigned
5. even if i create another integer type with value 50 and sum it up with num although it s overflow but yet i still can print out the correct sum value by using u specifier.so why unsigned keyword is still a necessity

5953241
sorting	grouping
once you re sorting the same value that you re using for the grouping attribute on your cfoutput you should be good to go

5954641
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
using this the data is stored correctly in the objectoutputstream objectinputstream - which effectively allows one to serialize and deserialize a bitmap object by storing it as a png in a byte in a custom object

5954690
rspec	capybara
i use capybara 1.0.0.beta1 and rspec 2.5

5954696

the only help i could find online is an old post of someone mentioning that you should put incoming data on a cache queue with one new data value released from the cash at a time every time the chart finishes working

5954775
g++	gcc
do a search for gcc instead of g++ it s usually in that package or gcc-c++

5955079
width	height
basically set the height of the ul and float and set a width for the li s and they will automatically wrap

5955093
width	height
another method although not one i d use would be to put your text in a div with a set width and height clipping any overflow with overflow hidden

5955141
portrait	landscape
the view is set up to be like a splitview but instead of having the static table when you flip it to landscape it will have the popover control like it normally does in the portrait mode

5955180
post	get
why don t you use query string get parameter instead of post

5955225

5955227
spaces	delimiter
i m useing a borrowed spaces delimiter split function which works great

5955496
getter	setter
you could replace your getter and setter with a property this way

5955496
getter	setter
you can add pretty much any protection level that is less that the one of the property to getter and setter

5955613
post	get
instead of passing data as post use simple get to the search page

5955613

you already have a cfstring and a cfstring is an nsstring so you don t need to create an nsstring

5955773
hash	md5
if you change the datetime and an operating system placed that datetime in the file it would change the md5 hash therefore changing the file

5955794
portrait	landscape

5956583
background-image	background-position
you can set the background-image property in css and use javascript to change the background-position

5956590
getter	setter
this might seem strange but your getter and setter just access that underlying property so if the xaml parser calls target.getvalue sourceproperty it gets the correct thing without calling your getter

5956593
put	get
but when i change the entity for example i put the key attribute for id i get the expected model has changed or something error

5956617

you install rubies with rvm but you install rails with bundler you can see bundler as an rvm for gems rather than rubies

bellman-ford	dijkstra
this comes at a cost however bellman-ford requires o |v|â |e| time while dijkstra s requires o |e| + |v|log|v| time which is asymptotically faster for both sparse graphs where e is o |v| and dense graphs where e is o |v| 2

hash	salt
a standard technique is to use a one-way hash on the salt and the number to create a big random looking number

5956733
salt	md5
for instance prefix-2_-3_ -4_ -3___ would be code 2343 and then you d fill in the blanks using data from md5 of prefix salt number

when i compile the swf there are no errors yet when i embed it into a web page i keep getting thrown either one of these two errors the first time the page loads in safari and google-chrome

5957806
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
use an objectoutputstream on the sending side and an objectinputstream on the receiving side

5957811
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari this works as expected..

5957817
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
let the objects implement the serializable marker interface and then transfer the objects using objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

5957821
post	get
you need to get hold of the post request body and explicitly decode it to a dict yourself using either the standard lib json or simplejson module

5957834
google-chrome	firefox
so save that into test.html and open it in firefox 4 and in google-chrome the h1 tag shows way smaller in firefox 4

5957845
fseek	ftell
i ve read posts that show how to use fseek and ftell to determine the size of a file

5957851
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu and centos

5957869
innodb	myisam
so it seems the answer is that you cannot do it for two reasons first because you are still populating the db while also wanting to read it and second because you are using innodb rather than myisam

5957878
try-catch	exception-handling
however we don t want to do this on every exception-handling because there may be a try-catch in our own code that is ignoring specific exception-handling

5957882
fseek	ftell
it s a much more direct and expressive method--you are literally asking the system to tell you the file s statistics rather than the more roundabout fseek ftell method

5957894
google-chrome	firefox
apparently firefox implements the nested section as an indication to reduce the size of the for the sub-section which makes sense while google-chrome does not

5957903

so how can i get the programmatically added subview to load in landscape and not portrait mode

5957910
button	checkbox
how would i put button or checkbox in a scroll pane so it will scroll

5957963
fseek	ftell
the reason to not use fstat is that fstat is posix but fopen ftell and fseek are part of the c standard

5957976

this works fine in portrait mode but when i switch to landscape it stays portrait

5958133
nunit	mstest
write your unit-tests normally with an established unit-testing framework such as nunit mstest etc

5958175
fseek	ftell
i d tend to agree with their basic conclusion that you generally shouldn t use the fseek ftell code directly in the mainstream of your code -- but you probably shouldn t use fstat either

5958175
fseek	ftell
even though the fseek ftell will give you the correct size with modern systems that data could be stale by the time you actually read the data so you could overrun your buffer anyway

5958230
postgresql	mysql
i ve never used mysql with eclipse but i ve done this with postgresql sql

5958253
boost	stl
i could easily implement a naive and slow program to do this myself however i m looking for the most elegant and efficient way to achieve this boost is fine if the stl does not provide all the necessary tools algos without rolling your own otherwise rolling your own is fine too

5958727
width	height
try putting a background color on a block div with width and height

5958735
margin	height
also using margin will not affect your element s dimensions whereas padding will make your elements dimensions set height + padding so for example if you have a 100x100px div with a 5 px padding your div will actually be 105x105px

5958743

on the way towards a lazy collection i made a functional mapping from an index from 0 to combination-size - 1 to the result at that position easily calculated with modulo and division just a bit concentration is needed

5965905
versioning	upgrade
your deployment project should be in the same solution as your app and then it can target the primary output of your app s project rather than manually selecting the .exe file each time that the project is built it then uses the project output so you don t need to do anything for an upgrade except to change the versioning of the deployment project and build the solution in a configuration which is set to build the deployment project

i can t imagine how saving the parent s height and width values would speed anything up

5967155
width	height
i also find it hard to envision a situation where knowing the parent container s width and height is helpful

5967155
children	parent
it is important to know how much size a component has for laying out it s own children not how much space the parent has

5967155
width	height
that is in essence the height and width of the component

5967155
actionscript	mxml

5967159
pull	push
many organizations set up a single git server and you just push pull to that server

5967204
post	get
if it s for removing magic quotes that php inserted you should be doing that where you extract user-provided values from get post etc

config	ini
however it was meant to read and write windows config ini files and windows config ini files are very flat and simple formats

5967298
config	ini
if you re using windows config ini files right now but may need to read more complex data structures in the future config any is a good way to go

5967298
config	ini
it ll handle windows config ini files and using the same programming interface read and write xml yaml and json file structures too

5967298
config	ini

getter	setter
this example is written in a clear object-oriented style with getter and setter

5968055
getter	setter
no since it knows nothing about your getter and setter

5968055
getter	setter
of course the proponents of getter and setter will suggest that you extend your interface with a member function sort

5968055
getter	setter
setter and getter make our daily programming hard but promise huge rewards in the future when we discover better ways to store arrays of integers in memory

5968124

5968466
aggregate-functions	sum
at first blush i have found that issues with aggregate-functions sum group by etc tend to stem from a overly large data sets that is you re just trying to pull back too much data or b from overly-complicated structure or relationships on the joined tables

5968549
directx	direct2d
this requires you to know the directx or direct2d libraries

5968550

superclass	subclassing
the construction is made up of two key parts a one public abstract interface serving as the â œfaceâ of the cluster which advertises the supported api and b many private concrete subclassing of this interface responsible for actually implementing the advertised behavior of the superclass in their own specific way

5969462
superclass	subclassing
the abstract superclass does implement a few methods itself the most significant being a factory method to vend instances of the private subclassing

5969462
superclass	subclassing
users of the cluster only ever see the one public superclass are unaware that it is actually abstract and know nothing about the existence of any private concrete subclassing

5969462
superclass	subclassing
the superclass offers a factory creational method which is responsible for determining which subclassing is appropriate for any given situation and transparently returning an instance of it

5969960
hide	show
but when i had it like that the sub-menu show hide didn t work and all the options were showing when first entering the page

5969960
hide	show
so i changed the link reference from page.php to # â ---which makes more sense since that option is not meant to be a link rather than just display another sub-menu but had to include it for the sake of displaying the active id--- and now the show hide works except after i click a sub-category the menu to the right opens but the previously selected sub-category that opens on hover closes and the php detect function doesn t work because i changed the reference to # and the link doesn t show an active status

5969993
inherited	properties
most properties can be given the value inherited which means the same value for this properties as the parent node has

5970026
subtract	add	subtraction	add	subtraction	multiplication
ok you might have noticed one awkward thing that i said you needed to subtract the sun position from the planet position first and add it after rotating but in the code above i apparentely added the sun position first and did the subtraction after but that is just because of the order of the matrix multiplication that are going on under the hood makes it reversed.

5970139

5970383
udp	tcp
what characteristics of tcp and udp make it useful for their respective use cases

apache	nginx
using a lighter web server like nginx as a reverse proxy and a static content server should keep the apache memory and cpu usage to a minimum which will be a problem on larger sites

5970458
udp	tcp
think of tcp as a dedicated scheduled ups fedex pickup dropoff of packages between two locations while udp is the equivalent of throwing a postcard in a mailbox

5970458
udp	tcp
tcp is as close to a guaranteed delivery protocol as you can get while udp is just best effort

5970493

mdpi	hdpi
keep in mind that there are three different directories to put your drawables in ldpi mdpi and hdpi drawables directories put your background images in the appropriate directory according to pixel density and the app will chose the appropriate one to use according to the device it is run on

5970656
int	chars
i suppose it could be a 2 dimensional array instead...then i could map int to the chars keys

5970681
entities	entitymanager
in other words the entitymanager holds a collection map most likely of entities

5970686
udp	tcp
boots and this is a time period when the client may not have its entire tcp ip stack loaded and running udp may be the only protocol the client is ready to handle at that time

5970686

this same request takes 5ms when requested from google-chrome or firefox

5971087
minimum	max
the max value displays fine but the minimum value constantly comes up as 0

5971096
width	margin
i gave #image and #outer a width and #right_content a negative margin to account for the #image s space

5971104
post	get
i m using the query below to get post based on the start and end dates which use the unix timestamp

5971136
many-to-many	one-to-many
but how do you handle creating and manipulating one-to-many or many-to-many relationships between different types

5971146
memcmp	strcmp
of course you could drop the from_abv function and give your members inscrutable names like sp tl and sr allowing you to directly compare them to your string data but you d need to change the strcmp to a memcmp with a size argument of sizeof #x - 1

5971176
put	get
when i put a similar thing into ejbql i get all sorts of errors raning from null poninter exceptions to invalid syntax exceptions -- here s what i have tried

5971177
rss	feed
in my rss feed i have a tag that resides in the is it possible to get at that

5971179
dbcontext	objectcontext
self tracking entities are feature of objectcontext - they are not supported in dbcontext

5971205
nsnull	nsstring
at some point in your code you are either calling isequaltostring on an object that you think is an nsstring but is really nsnull or more likely you are passing an nsnull to a method property of a class somewhere that expects a nsstring

5971219
hide	show
i wrote a script that show hide a div depending on which checkbox is selected

5971225
min	max
in this example the object would have two properties min and max whose values are 0 and 1 respectively

5971252
post	put
to create users clients would still be required to submit xml data over http post or put depending on whether they know the final url and if they know all the necessary information for a user resource

5971268
width	height
im now using insamplesize 8 but how can the imageview automatically scale the image to be in the right height width proportions and fill the screen

5971289
mktime	strtotime
some combination of mktime and strtotime should work

5971311
atof	getline
the problem is that when input ends the getline call will fail and it will not update the string you are then converting an empty string to a float which is failing in the atof call if atof fails it will return 0.0 and pushing that value into the vector

5971311
min	max
in your particular case i would use the std copy and std istream_iterator s for reading the input but for processing the already read numbers i would unroll a manual loop so that all min max and sum can be calculated in one pass the stl examples above do it in three passes

5971587
chunked	transfer-encoding
i sent a transfer-encoding chunked header but i m still having the same problem when downloading it from the phone

5971602
google-chrome	safari
i tested in on recent versions of safari and google-chrome in macos ios and android

5971633
mouseover	mouseout
what happens is that i can locate the div and use a google.maps.event.adddomlistener to attach a mouseover and mouseout event to the infobox except it s too fiddly -- when i mouseover a child node within the infobox it counts as a mouseout on the parent node and fires the event

5971652
stdout	stderr
you can often append to redirect the stderr output to the normal stdout stream

5971660
fink	macports
i d look at installing ghostscript via macports or fink

5971691
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
which works fine in ie firefox opera but it doesnt in google-chrome

5971776
put	get
everything went fine until we got the db up and had put some of the data in it and then to get some of the data we were importing from another location we had to change field lengths

5971795
inherited	properties
so you may want to make all the models you pass to the views inherited from a base model class that has the properties required for master page and make the master page have the base type as the model type but it ll be too ugly

5971809
many-to-many	one-to-many
i have some many-to-many and some one-to-many associations that fail to eager load

5971815
post	get
these functions are actually called from ajax post requests so when i get a successful return value from _addsamplestocart i do a simple javascript redirect window.location and it correctly takes me there but i m not logged in

post	get
this blog post shows how to analyze access log with moving mean in gnuplot and preprocess data with awk to get totals for every second

5971906
super	implements
we settled on this because it was super fast to implements didn t require tinkering with the registration process worked with existing users and didn t require extra queries every page load since the user and user profile is retrieved on every page already

fadein	fadeout
the fadeout fadein image effect

5971926
versioning	upgrade
note that support for desktop versioning of 8.04 lts is due to expire shortly -- if this is a desktop machine perhaps the easiest answer is to upgrade to 10.04 lts 10.10 or the very-soon-upcoming 11.04 release or whatever they ll call the next release

5971932
hex	binary
i have a ruby-on-rails app that accepts a binary file upload stores it as an activerecord object in a local database and passes a hex equivalent of the binary blob to a back-end web service for processing

5971932

jboss	weblogic
i m working in an infrastructure team jboss 4.02 tomcat 5.5 weblogic 8.1 servers in my company...some of the weblogic java applications are moving to jboss tomcat servers.so what are the criterias we need to consider whether we need to go for jboss or tomcat

5971943

i don t have a database ready to receive the input so i d just like each button to simply send an email to me if it was clicked

5971966
children	parent
when i delete child employee from parent organization list of children and then execute delete everything works fine

5972007
jboss	weblogic
jboss uses tomcat as its servlet jsp engine so it s jboss and tomcat or weblogic

5972010

i have a controller with typical create methods one for get one for post

5972023
x86	mips
nonetheless this is at least a general idea of the core of what happens and it s still at a high enough level to apply about equally to an arm x86 mips sparc etc.

boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt
i did some work on this a long time ago.i found the knuth-morris-pratt algorithm faster than boyer-moore

5972047
for-loop	arrays
inside the for-loop you re allocating a new arrays of int pointers but the original type for maxc was of type pointer-to-pointer

5972047
for-loop	arrays
therefore the statement inside the for-loop is assigning the wrong type to each arrays element

5972169
width	height
the bounding rectangle is essentially a cvrect struct containing the x-position y-position width and height of the smallest rectangle that encloses the selected contour feature

5972169
width	height
additionally the width and height fields in the structure will tell you about the similarity in size

5972174
hide	show
to make things hide and show use drupal_add_js for whatever javascript you want

5972201

alternately you could hash checksum with a native mysql function like md5 and use only the first x chars if you need a short voucher code

5972333
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy
use log.d to write messages to the logcat when an activity life cycle event occurs such as onpause onstop ondestroy oncreate onstart and onresume

width	height
presently attributes that are used in layered navigation can t be grouped meaning if you have several attributes that are logically in one group attributes height width depth which are dimensions and color and texture belong in an appearance section

5972503
children	parent
i am not aware of a means to store a counter_cache without using the belongs_to relationship because only the parent can store the count of the children

5972515
fseek	ftell
when i build this to check for errors i get errors saying fopen fseek ftell rewind and fclose isn t declared in this scope

5972519
children	parent
parent cannot see members defined in their children

5972532

the width seems all right with 100 but 100 height doesn t work

5972625
linefeed	delimiter
and read from flatfile connection manager column delimiter as | and row delimiter as cr linefeed into col1 col2 col3 col4 then identfying the value with string supperator and getting the value

5972636
width	height
what you want to do after a user uploads that image verify that the file is a real image then using some library if you use a framework it probably has a way to resize images resize the image to whatever max width or max height or max width and height you are wanting

5972688
post	get
to get a different number of post from the blog pages show at most setting just add a posts_per_page parameter to your query

this being said the example i showed is not a one-to-one relation but rather a many-to-one for the faculty object and a one-to-many for the university object

5972723
mvp	presenter
the difference is really subtle between mvc and mvp when you describe them and resides in the definition of view and presenter controller responsibilities

nsstring is not mutable as is nsmutablestring

5972870
int	chars
the values associated with your enum are still int s you ve just set using a chars literal

5972923
client-side	server-side
either you have to write complicated client-side code to find each field that you need to modify in each repeater-item or you have to blow away the whole server-side output of the repeater and construct new html from the scratch or the method that i ve been using lately take the first repeated item blow away everything else and clone the first item as many time as you need to and modify it s fields

5972923
client-side	server-side
all of the described methods are not optimal because no matter what they require quite a bit of repeated logic on the server-side template in repeater and on the client-side javascript to display json data

5972924
doc	odf
so what i need is a class or component which has a function like these converttoodf htmlcode converttodoc htmlcodes which return odf and doc format

5972924
doc	odf
however the doc and odf file should be without problem and the pictures and tables should be shown nicely

5972976
for-loop	arrays
in my code i have for-loop that indexes over a multidimensional numpy arrays and does some operation using the sub-array that is obtained at each iteration

5972977
width	height
this way the content of the inner div is going to set the height of the inner div and negative margins on it will make sure that the outer div is always 20px bigger in height and 40px bigger in width the content div

implements	extends
just to make sure you are using a class that implements listadapter or extends some other sort of adapter right

5973147
vbo	normals
having now looked into rendering with vertex normals colour arrays and vbo s i have decided to consolidate all actual opengl communication into a separate module

5973155
portrait	landscape
do not use the same layout for both portrait and landscape modes

5973155
portrait	landscape
it would be better to have different layouts for portrait and landscape modes so that the control of the design will be in our hands

5973164
jtable	jxtreetable
subclass jtable or in my case jxtreetable

5973170
exponent	modulo
with a public exponent and modulo the best you could hope to do is to get something like this

5973170
post	get	exponent	modulo
if however the above is what you re looking for let me know and i can post further instructions on how to get it from the modulo public exponent

5973233

5973339
devise	cancan
now that i have cancan and devise working nicely i need to add to my tests

5973351
equals	compareto
if you want to save time - implement compareto and use it inside equals

5973360
post	get
final note when using .load if you pass the data as a string it will use get but if you pass it as an object it uses post

5973375

i have these two javascript functions that change a background and show and hide fields however it only works once for each button

5973398
min	max
i m trying to get the min max and average of the set of employees who aren t supervisors

5973440
width	height
however the behavior for the dimensions of the text area is awkward and i had to set a static height and width to it

5973443
firefox	safari
i have both .mp3s and .wav files ready so that it can play in safari and firefox

5973445
width	height
up top i have had to define the width and height of the path

5973445
width	height
i was just wondering is there a way i can not do that and simply allow silverlight to determine the width and height of the path from the canvas

5973445
width	height
or perhaps define an explicit width height like say 100 100 and force the inner path to draw to that

5973445
width	height
currently the viewbox scales the path down to fit inside its parent grid and itw ould be ideal if the canvas could set the paths width and height such that it would fit

5973445
width	height
i guess this sin t that important since i can always just keep defining width and height but i figure if i can make the xaml simpler i should try

5973508
square-bracket	braces
json_encode only makes the process easier as it d be pretty easy to make a quoting bracket braces square-bracket error when creating the string manually

5973556
mouseover	mouseout
how do i stay the child open on mouseover mouseout on the parent1 and if mouseover the other parent2 its child opens up and the parent1 childs hide on mouseover on this parent2

5973581
width	height
the path does have a width and height

5973595
width	height
the function first gets the width and height of the bitmap and then finds the sample size closest to the required size

5973595
width	height
the problem is that the bitmap returned from bitmapfactory.createscaledbitmap src width height filter always comes back with a width and height of -1

5973595
width	height
i then calculate the ratio this way i can keep the same height to width ratio with the scaled image in this case the ratio is 0.598.

5973595
width	height
using the ratio and the new surface area i can find the new width which is 773 and a height of 1293

5973595
width	height
so i m passing in a width of 773 a height of 1293

5973635

5973665
submit	submission
the default form submission is occurring because of the input type submit

5973665
submit	submission
you could change your submit button to be a different html tag like a span and then use jquery to assign the click event to handle your submission or you could cancel the default action within your submit handler you have now see the submit documentation for jquery on how to do that

5973677
post	get
i saw similar types of post here.but i am not getting this right.to get the uid of running process i wrote

glut	pyopengl
this code nets me with a clear color glut window which seems to suggest that it s not rendering my triangles for some reason but i have no idea why that could be and i can t really find any examples for pyopengl that don t use deprecated functions so i can t see if they did anything different from me that i m missing

5973743
width	height
camera.setmode - sets aspects of the camera capture mode including height width and frames per second

5973748
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i personally haven t used to loops through an arrays because i always just do a for-loop so you can try this

5973791
width	height
on hover i am increasing the image width and height to 400px and 300px respectively and on mouseout i am restoring back to their original size

5973811

5974064
inherited	properties
i have a view model that inherited from a baseclass that has a properties called isreadonly

5974156
mouseover	mouseout
regardless now that you definitely have a reference to the element that actually caused the mouseover or mouseout event you can use it to do your actions i ll stick with somevariable for now

5974156
mouseover	mouseout	actualheight	actualwidth
simply expand the image to 400x300 on mouseover without caring and then back to the stored off actualwidth and actualheight when they mouseout

5974377
width	height
in recent jqueries you can t even get its width or height

5974377
hide	show
on the other hand if you .show an element then hide it before an execution loop an event firing through to when there s no more code to run for that event the browser will be forced to relayout the page and you ll be able to get its offset between when it s show and hidden but it won t be forced to repaint so your users won t see a blip and you won t lose as much performance as you might think

5974430
hide	show
you can use uibutton custom and set background image with combobox image you can get from google or create thorough gimp in mac if user presses the button show uipickerview below the button or at the bottom of iphone screen or wherever you want.after selecting value from it you can hide pickerview and change the title of uibutton.you can achieve this through tableview also

5974559
width	height
if you know the width and height of it in advance you can use this method

5974559
width	height
otherwise you will need to get the computed values of width and height in javascript

5974571
min	max
select clause like either min primarykey or max primarykey

5974573

my understanding is that jms producers are inherently transacted via jta

5974723
jms	jta
by sending a message via jms messageproducer the thread-local jta transaction is used if one is present

5974723
int	boolean
note that within a jta transaction the parameters passed to create queue topic session boolean transacted int acknowledgemode method are not taken into account

chances are your web apps need jndi data sources and jta transactions - these things come built in to jboss 4+ whereas you would have to graft them on to tomcat 5.x with much effort

jsf	seam
i m using the jsf 1.2 + seam 2.2.1 and jbossas 4.0.4

5978022
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
you can simply add the overlay div statically on the page on each image and then hide it on mouseover and show it on mouseout with a nice fading effect

5978063
hive	hdfs
the data to load afterwards on the hive table is already on the hdfs and i would prefer having the table metadata created automatically by sqoop hive rather than creating it manually and loading the data afterwards

5978112
folder	directory
i debugged the problem it was because the execute directory is system32 and not the setup folder

5978225
listview	gridview
in gridview setadapter as you normally do for custom listview by extending baseadapter and passing the arraylist of paths to this adapter class

5978352
udp	tcp
the reason udp is faster than tcp is because there is no form of flow control or error correction

5978352
udp	tcp
1 tcp is connection oriented and reliable where as udp is connection less and unreliable

5978352
udp	tcp
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not

5978360
rss	feed
i have an rss feed working in my app but it doesnt display all the text of each article.it only displays about half of the text that it should display in the uiwebview.is there anyway to make it display the lot of the text

no you don t want to call free because you never malloc -ed the data

5978383
free	malloc
free should always correspond to a call to a malloc function

it seems that setting your click listeners in onresume and nulling them out in onpause does the trick too

keep in mind that the point of swt is to use native controls so if you desire the ability to completely customize your controls perhaps using swing would be a better option

5978909
swt	swing
i haven t tried it out yet but i know that whereas eclipse rcp uses swt as a widget toolkit netbeans rcp relies on swing so that may save you from some headaches regarding compatibility problems and so on

5978940

screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
i am testing on a mdpi large screens acer iconia tab and a hdpi medium screens samsung galaxy tab

5979311
mdpi	hdpi
presumably because the acer still uses the mdpi icon and the samsung uses the bigger one but scales it down by 50 because it knows its hdpi if am confident that this surprising scaling occurs because if i move the 48pix icon to the mdpi folder and have nothing in the hdpi folder the icon shows very large on the samsung

personally i would use a datagroup using virtuallayout true wrapped in a scroller set to height width 100 which would only show when the data overflows

5980933
width	height
what is really irritating is if i use a vertical orientation on the linearlayout with both weights at 1 and the height and width layout params wrap_content and fill_parent values switched it works correctly

5980965
ssl	https
i know that ssl uses public-key cryptography and is the backbone behind the https connection

5980977
cpu	affinity
i think you would be better served by looking in to message passing between two processes that have cpu affinity setup but even then i think the gains would be nominal over-optimizing a problem

5981037
libxml2	libxslt
option 1 - download sources for libxml2 and libxslt and compile and install them under your somewhere then build python-lxml against those copies

5981082

5981127
redmine	trac
i ve looked through the descriptions of various bugtracking systems redmine trac jira etc... and i can t find any documentation that would indicate how they work with this they usually have single commit examples in the docs only

5981149
getter	setter
my problem however is that neither of these methods discriminate between the setter and getter and so i m reduced to using find-in-files for propertyname

5981149
getter	setter
that seems like a step backwards and would obviously not find code using propertyname + value or similar so i was wondering if i d missed a simple way of persuading the call hierarchy function of visual studio to work on a property setter or getter specifically

5981167
cassini	iis
if i run my sample program from the vs2010 debugger with either cassini or iis express it works great

5981177
equals	gethashcode
the problem is equals and gethashcode is never called

5981196
spaces	delimiter
it works fine but i would like the files to be comma delimiter text files and it is storing it with spaces between the columns and this creates unnecessary increase in size

5981250

also you needn t fflush stdout if you use a puts for the last line there instead of a print

5981281
int	double
if they are the multiplication occurs with int types int overflow and it is being promoted to double afterwards

5981289
instances	transient
saving child and flushing session as in the following test causes object references an unsaved transient instances -save the transient instances before flushing on parent

5981298
equals	gethashcode
should we override both equals and gethashcode properties when implementing a custom class instances comparison

5981305
ienumerable	iequalitycomparer
the iequalitycomparer isn t called until the ienumerable is enumerated

5981313
int	double
java multiplies the int which overflows becoming negative and then stores that negative value in your double

5981314
int	double
else an c12 as int will be multiplied by another int and the result overflows and is later - too late - converted to double

5981320
autocompletetextview	spinner
i don t know if you re still interested but i found this answering a similar question problem with autocompletetextview and spinner using the same adapter

5981331
onclick	onchange
we setup onclick or onchange events for the radio buttons and repopulated our dropdows from the javascript arrays depending on the datatype selected in the radio button

5981351
width	height
the w and h do not seem to affect the width and height of the nsstepper object

5981365
vim	emacs	vim	notepad++
however given that lisp code will have nested parentheses you will likely want an editor which will help you match open and close parentheses such as notepad++ or if you re a little more unix-centric emacs or vim

5981378
folder	directory
this works perfect for particular directory inside the public folder like system ...however i need to do the same on individual files

5981574
vsto	add-in
with typical vsto add-in the add-in is registered under the excel add-in key

5981574
vsto	add-in
i believe there is a per document type of add-in you can build with vsto but if you do that it wouldn t surprise me at all that excel would fail to load the doc across different install types of excel since they aren t automatically compatible

5981580

5981686
tostring	string.format
you could also call string.format on that value instead of tostring and it should work just as well

5981727
equals	gethashcode
the distinct method will use the gethashcode method to determine inequality between the items and the equals method to determine equality

5981727
equals	gethashcode
in your implementation of the b class you have an inconsistent implementation of the gethashcode and equals method so the comparison won t work properly

5981728
equals	gethashcode
here s what you need to understand about the relationship between equals and gethashcode

5981728
equals	gethashcode
so gethashcode must return the same value for two objects that you want to be considered equals

5981747
mouseout	mouseenter
it also won t use the new mouseenter and mouseout functions

5982208
haskell	ocaml
one would seldom if ever assign a specific numbers to any of the enum values - it is a facility that is not part of the point of the enumerated type but it is very occasionally useful so it is kept and serves more to confuse the beginning programmer than to assist and should not be envisaged as an integral part of enumeration - some languages do not even permit it modula-3 haskell ocaml

5982718
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended

i m not sure that this is what you want but it s possible to temporarily hide a window so that when you want it you can simply show it again

5983487

5983837
fadein	fadeout
i would have used fadein and fadeout functions with callbacks

5983837
fadein	fadeout
then you re sure your fadein animation begins after the fadeout ends

this happens because sometimes slidedown can t accurately calculate the height when the element width is altered in the brief moment its absolute

5984191
pull	push
then by mistake i clicked pull instead of push

5984231
post	get

5984349
google-chrome	firefox
is this still the case nowadays with google-chrome and firefox 4.0 i hear good things about ie 9 as well

5984350
int	double
to use these values as an index you have to convert them to a class that can store larger int like double to avoid saturation at the maximum value of 255 then add one since you need an index from 1 to 256

5984351
textarea	textbox
i need to add a function to the onkeydown for the textarea so i can check whether or not the length of the textbox has reach a max limit textarea elements don t support a maxlength property unfortunately

5984490
postgresql	mysql
some support multiple table updates like mysql or postgresql you can then write the query as

5984538
nfa	dfa
a direct implementation of an nfa which is not a dfa since dfa is a subset of nfa usually involves allowing backtracking whereas a direct implementation of a dfa requires only as many steps as the input length so in that sense dfas arrive at the answer faster than equivalent nfas which are not dfas

5984538
nfa	dfa
this is especially true when attempting to demonstrate the existence of a fa since the existence of an nfa is as good as the existence of a dfa

5984538
nfa	dfa
if a dfa is needed algorithms exist for a converting the nfa to an equivalent dfa and b minimizing the dfa

5984613

5984954
hash	md5
probably an md5 hash or just regular entity encoding see below

5984968

5985061
padding	overlapping
you shouldn t use position absolute unless you really need it and there are other much cleaner ways to get this layout but a quick fix for your problem is if you change your padding styles to margins that way the spacing is not inside your div so there is no overlapping and you are able to click your element

5985144
children	parent
so we have 2t+1 keys we split the node into two nodes and push one element to the parent leaving 2t keys in the two children and t keys in each child

5985157
onclick	onchange
i have done most of thing but one thing i need to check is for onclick onchange events

5985165
internationalization	localization
of course my personal recommendation would be ruby on rails - it has activerecord support fantastic out-of-the-box internationalization and localization support and many more

5985166
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if that is the case then there s no need to define a similar method in the subclassing since the method from the superclass is inherited by the subclassing

5985200
hide	show
i m searching for my site something that can show and hide some html after 10 seconds for example

5985211
try-catch	exception-handling
a checked exception-handling is different the compiler won t let you just let it propagate you need to either surround any code which might throw a checked exception-handling with try-catch blocks and throw exception-handling is the simplest case if exception-handling is an instance of a checked exception-handling class or you must mark the method which contains the call to code that might throw a checked exception-handling with a throws declaration

5985211
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
if the desired behaviour is to throw an unchecked-exception then you ll need to wrap the exception in a runtimeexception

5985254
portrait	landscape
i want the development platform to always appear in landscape and everything else in portrait

5985255
stdout	stderr
redirects stdout and stderr to logfile

5985328
singleton	facade
i know there are lots of design patterns facade singleton decorator etc... but i m reading about asp.net mvc and i m about two sentences into the intro and i m already confused

5985342
free	malloc
when cleaning up this pointer construct do i just free the main pointer once and free finds all the subsequent allocations or do i have to free up every malloc i created

5985353
free	malloc
you have to call free for every malloc you stated to prevent a memory leak

5985355
free	malloc
as a general rule for every malloc you have a free

5985413
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
free frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

5985413
free	malloc
so as others have said if you want to free all the memory you allocated you have to free everything you malloc ed

5985422
codeigniter	cakephp
some other php frameworks to check out zend symfony cakephp codeigniter

5985439
pop-up	dialog
i m using jquery ui dialog for pop-up that read from external pages

5985446

i don t think this is possible in xcode 4 but from console you can add a git remote to the mba or imac from each of them and pull and push between them as and when you desire

5985484
uigesturerecognizer	subviews
i was working on some code that had the same issue and turns out the problem was a subviews with a uigesturerecognizer had been added as a subviews to mkmapview and sometimes they would cause some delegate methods not to fire

5985537
min	max
min and max of course but what about perm space size

5985582
getter	setter
classes that mostly only have class variables a constructor and getter setter

5985655
folder	directory
lets say the file with your main method is in the directory projecthome then your java beans go in a folder projecthome com mycompany model

5985783
loops	if-statement
use an if-statement inside loops for the null check instead

5985864
inherited	properties
i also have a control that inherited from textblock and all it does is add some properties that determine what the text value should be it doesn t affect the style at all

5985864
inherited	properties
i was able to add a properties changed override for the foreground properties and found out that the style s foreground value gets applied and then the inherited value gets applied after that

5985866
x86	64bit
see the x86 tag wiki for links to x86 asm resources mostly aimed at 32 and 64bit

5985903
onmouseover	onclick
the question is how can i pass as a parameter any event like onclick or onmouseover ... so i am able to rewrite the function this.appendevt like this

5985965
google-chrome	firefox
while testing i came across a scenario in which firefox 4 and internet explorer 8 render the table in the way i expect it to be rendered and google-chrome 11 doesn t

5985965
google-chrome	firefox
here s a very simple scenario to illustrate the different rendering try it in google-chrome and firefox ie to see the difference

5985965
google-chrome	firefox
any ideas to make this table look the same in google-chrome as it does in firefox and internet explorer

5986041
post	get
using post has to be less of a subversion of the http spec than sending a get body

5986057
min	max
aggregation functions max min etc return immediately

5986079
width	height
edit - so i added the detail disclosure button as suggested below i can detect that my cell has an accessorytype but the accessoryview width and height are garbage

5986079
width	height
i need a width and height because right now the accessory is on top of my row text since i m not accounting for it in my layoutsubviews code

5986095
newid	hashbytes
you can use hashbytes to sha1 a string and newid to generate a random guid as salt

5986152
aggregate-functions	sum
all you can do is report on aggregate-functions sum count min etc -- these are able to combine the multiple values into a single cell in the result

5986170
move	drag
the content should be scrolled along the slider when you drag and move it forward and backward

5986188
put	get
there is a setup program a few other files that get put into the location that you specify when you publish it

5986216
folder	directory
you can use the svn update --set-depth exclude foldername to remove this folder from your working directory

5986228
inherited	properties
my guess is that for textblock the foreground properties is inherited from its parent unless you explicitly set it on your textblock instane

5986243
setinterval	settimeout
many use setinterval or settimeout to check on the content and update the count from time to time say 50ms but such approaches can be computationally inefficient

5986247
profiling	debugging
the export release build is not in the profiling perspective but it is in the debugging and flash perspectives

5986248
antialiasing	transparent
i suspect the answer involves finding some way to represent transparent pixels such that antialiasing ignores them for sampling purposes

5986248
antialiasing	transparent
if i change antialiasing to bicubic and then process the alpha channel such that any semi-transparent pixels are rendered completely transparent i get rid of most of the borders on most of the tiles

5986263
implements	extends
or do i implements it in the children and extends from the abstract class

5986343
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
i know the difference in memory usage between byte unsigned short and integer but when it comes to a bufferedimage is there a speed difference between them

5986373
google-chrome	firefox
so far it works well on firefox google-chrome and even ie8

5986386
binutils	bfd
not so much gdb as the bfd library used by gdb binutils etc

5986395
glulookat	glrotate
i haven t found the part where you setup the camera modelview matrix with glulookat or gltranslate glrotate glscale

5986408
postgresql	mysql
stored procedures and functions are very similar between oracle and sql server or mysql postgresql etc

5986412
int	chars
this is fine for chars and other int but gets a bit tricky for floating-point types

5986420
width	height
the problem is the checkbox hover isnt spot on for the width and height of the checkbox

5986427
prepare	execute
it occurs randomly for queries execute using dbi s prepare execute blocks when dbi is routed through pgpool2 3.0.3

5986431
hide	show
now i m not sure but i think that it might just hide the representing the list but i m not 100 sure so you may be able to just show all the s representing each summary..

5986435
width	height
it draws a rectangular border starting at the x and y coordinates given as the first two parameters having a width and height given by the third and fourth parameters the width of the border given by the fifth parameter in the color given by the sixth parameter

5986435
width	height
the parameter list is x y width height borderwidth color

5986541
accessor	properties
the vast majority of the time you can write your properties without needing to overwrite the accessor mutator methods generated for you by the compiler

5986549
folder	directory
i created a test string that outputs the content root directory and it is as follows gamename bin x86 debug content minus my personal folder preceding it of course

5986550
rss	feed
pipes can create json feed from rss sources

5986550
rss	feed
i think the answer to this question would be very helpful for people looking to use rss feed to drive their calendar

5986568
metaphone	soundex
it is based upon metaphone which was designed to correct some of the deficiencies of soundex

5986592
inherited	properties
since tag is an inherited properties from uiview you cannot use it with uiimage itself but you can use it with uiimageview

5986609
hide	show
i wanna know how to hide and show a html element using the original javascript not jquery

5986625

the cmdlet start-job use another thread from the pool allocated by powershell so it makes the dialog non-modal and it does not freeze

5986861
for-loop	arrays	put	get
i ve tried to put the panels in an arrays but i m using gui swing on netbeans and the jpanels are already declared when i put them into the jframe and when i try putting them in an arrays and using a for-loop i get a null pointer error

5986933
google-chrome	firefox
the page in question works perfectly well in google-chrome firefox and ie8

5986934
vbscript	vb6
i also want to know if in the future i have to add vb6 vbscript and powershell scripts as clients what would be the best ipc option that works for all these 6 languages

5986962
width	height
yep you are right about the weight when you want the width or height to be controlled by weight its convention to set that value to 0dip and let the weight control the actual value

5987000
folder	directory
i ve basically added an initial block that specifically looks for directory within your domain folder that don t end with a trailing slash and added one

5987002
hide	show
update a better approach as noted by mellamokb would be to hide the original image and then show it again when you hit the reset button

5987087
exponent	addition
in reality you ll get an addition 3 bits for the exponent for a total of 11 and an additional 29 bits for the fraction for a total of 52

5987249
width	height
hi i have loaded a bitmap and i need to set my own height and width

5987288
width	height
what you need is to scale the image rather than just assign a width height property

5987352
switching	screens
it won t be called if the same row one with the switching goes off screens and comes back on after the cell has been reused

5987355
width	height
i believe the only way to load a high resolution image at it s original size is to use exiflib on the byte stream to detect the original height and width then create a writeablebitmap at that size and use the system.windows.media.imaging - extensions.loadjpeg method to load the image into the object

5987375
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade the make versioning and everything is running the way it should..

5987765
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
there have been various posts over the years regarding control of the size of a qdockwidget in a qmainwindow dock area

5987765
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
starting with a qmainwindow subclass mw and a qdockwidget subclass dw

5987765
width	margin
the sizehint of the other panel after construction is used along with appropriate margin spacing to set the base size of the dw with the constructed sizehint width of the panel that will change visibility providing the increment to the base size when appropriate the dw implementation is provided with a panel_visible method that is used to enable or disable the variable panel by applying setvisible to the panel and changing the value of the sizehint by the increment value

5987765
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
perhaps these qmainwindow qdockwidget issues have been dealt with in a later version of qt

for-loop	loops
i m pretty sure i know how to do one with a for-loop but i m curious if anyone knows of a way by using a while loops

5987810
post	get	post	put	put	get
my understanding is that post requests to user thing containing xml should then automatically get deserialized and put it into before thing_post is called

5987810
post	get
for what it s worth i get exactly the same behavior if i create sub thing and sub thing_post and then use curl to issue a post request to user thing.

5987964
flask	cherrypy
i can t speak for flask but i can for cherrypy

5987964
flask	cherrypy
that line about a methoddispatcher is a no-op since it only affects cherrypy applications and you don t appear to have mounted any just a single flask app instead

5987974
for-loop	loops
as you said that you have done using for-loop you can follow following steps to convert it to while loops

5988002

on a similar note you may use .toggle method to show hide elements with jquery

5988225
requestfactory	gwt
i think a nicer solution that has been solved in gwt 2.1+ is by making use of requestfactory and the entity valueproxy mechanism

5988261
hide	show
now whenever you want to show or hide line1 change the property if bindings are setup properly everything will magically work

5988261
hide	show
for example to hide and to show

5988266
qdockwidget	qwidget
with a qdockwidget subclass dw in which a qwidget with a qhboxlayout that has two widgets left-panel and right-panel added all of which have had their size policies set to qsizepolicy minimum the dw normally has both panel widgets visible

5988266
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
either i am missing something in how to control the size of qdockwidget which given the difficulty i ve had understanding all the interactions amongst the parts of the layout management system is quite likely or the qmainwindow is ignoring or overriding the layout instructions that it is being given

5988266
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
closely examining the event stream during the qdockwidget repositioning operations suggests the latter after the slot handling the docklocationchanged signal has done its resizing work and returned to the event loop i can see that the qmainwindow when user repositioning is done applies additional re-size operations on the affected qdockwidget thus undoing the application logic that attempts to control the dock size

5988276
oasis	ocamlbuild
high-level build systems like oasis ocamlbuild omake etc hide all this stuff altogether and user only needs to provide names of dependent packages

5989510
ready	each
if your threads are doing i o then this is a strong contender for the speed-up as each thread blocks waiting for the i o the processor can run the other threads until they too block for i o hopefully by which time the data for the first thread is ready and so forth

google-chrome	firefox
in develeper-tools you can see the initially bottom in firefox is something like 500px exactly 511px for me in google-chrome not present

5989542

after the event is finished the updatepanel inside the usercontrol should update and show the message + hide the spinner

5989579
hide	show
this tabs are for having content hide show and if using ajax pull the page info and show it on demand

5989585
int	double
targeting x64 may improve things noticeably but if you re stuck on 32-bit you could consider whether it is possible to replace the int keys with double since the cpu can handle those natively i don t know what the default hashing function for double look like though and it is possible it will be slower overall but it may be worth testing at least

5989592
folder	directory
update on .git directory user_controlled_site_layouts is in the refs heads feature folder

5989624

5989687
postgresql	mysql
i try to use mysql instead of postgresql but result is same

5989727
std	ostream
also you should use std copy and an ostream iterator for this rather than for_each but you know your own mind best

5989757
width	height
and model everyother rectangle after that with diefferent height and width attributes

5989774

5989895
apache	nginx

so you can t just implement a bunch of getter and setter functions and call it good

5989969

this command when executed runs system wide version of bundler you probably have 1.9.1 installed instead of the rvm one

5989977

4 different layouts and switching between them depending on the client s screens resolution

5990009
qtcpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager

5990054
chown	chmod
chown to the php user or chmod to 777

5990056
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
you won t be able to implement it in pure java without huge problems if it s possible at all because networking is handled by the jvm and basically support only tcp and udp icmp is not implemented for example though ping is partly available in java 6

5990124
post	get
you should be able to use the method in the post int the comments but you could also use specialcells like range a a .specialcells xlcelltypeconstants xlnumbers .copy to get all of the filled cells

5990134
x86	mips
this is architecture-dependent - so x86 arm ppc mips .

5990187
voip	sip
also it uses sip voip library obviously it is using threads

5990223
width	height
it sounds a bit crazy but i just can t set the height and width of a elements of my navigation

5990239
teamcity	nant
it makes sense i think to use a teamcity template to keep these configurations in sync overriding the differences with parameters and variables overriding nant targets

5990241
width	height
a-tag is an inline element so your height and width are ignored

5990242
width	height
you can t set the width and height of inline elements

5990266
width	height
you did not specify the height or width for parent layout so i think that is the problem

5990433
hide	show
there you have show how to show it and hide it on mouse click in my case right mouse click

5990468
width	height
i manage to get the right alignment my drawable is a circle square so width height

you can copy the image s buffer into a new bitmapsource image of the same format pixelformat height width stride using create from array or create from intptr and display that bitmapsource in wpf s image control

5990539
integer	unsigned
specifically i am using a fixed width 8-bit unsigned integer which can hold at maximum 8 bits surprise which represents 256 as the largest possible integer

5990548
accessor	properties
you will need to ensure you are annotation the properties accessor and not the fields instance variables when dealing with jpa entities

int	chars	int	double
this function works well with int short and chars but need some improvments to works with double and float

5990609

5990613
hash	md5
i m storing username and password in a mysql database and have them hash using md5

5990613
hash	salt
do you run it several times through a different hash mechanism or add some form of salt

5990642
hash	salt
switch to a different hash mechanism you can do it incrementally as people log in and definitely use a different for each user salt

5990674
int	double
the value in the selected row column is a double but i ve also tried with string values and long int values at no success

5990715
hash	md5
whilst md5 is not decryptable it can be beaten by either rainbow tables or matching the hash

5990715
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
salt will work against rainbow table but not against matching the hash which has been achieved with md5

5990760
setinterval	clearinterval
there s also the related setinterval clearinterval which does the same thing but repeatedly at the interval you specify until you stop it

5990781
salt	md5
at the very least dump md5 although computationally fast not very secure these days and use something a little more secure like sha256 with a long salt

5990789
width	height
if image is not 100 height and width use background-position to position your image where you want it

5990901
pull	push
but i cannot push pull from repository neither i can clone from repositories

5990943
hash	md5
reason why md5 is considered broken is because md5 returns same hash for strings that differ in small percentage

5990943
hash	md5
however some of them like md5 have less possible hash and execute faster

5990948
put	get
you can either customize that page or you can put a redirect on the page to get visitors where you want them to end up

5991023
mvp	presenter
i m only familiar with a few presentation patterns mvp model view presenter common in windows forms asp.net mvc model view controller and mvvm model view view model commonly used in wpf silverlight

5991028
mvp	presenter
on a side note in mvp parlance activities are presenter and views are displays so when you say put several presenter displays into my activity it really makes no sense

5991029
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox safari google-chrome but not in internet explorer

5991093

5994241

you get this callback every time a new item in the gallery gets put in the center so be careful not to do anything to work intensive because if the user scrolls fast you are going to get a callback for each item they pass

5994253

5994528
setinterval	settimeout
i would wonder if settimeout and or setinterval would not be effective beause the variables are keeping their values

5994530
folder	directory
as plugin for svn you could use subclipse or subversive for the version numbers of your application you have to decide by yourself how to number it and create a copy of the code in the svn repository usually in the tag folder while the main development would be in the tunk a directory with the version number

5994563
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout or setinterval to re-run your code as necessary

you are mixing up keycode and charcode which is understandable because event.keycode actually contains charcode for keypress events unlike keydown and keyup

5994641
getter	setter
it does mean that you need more discipline to write getter setter if you re going to code this way

5994653

calloc	malloc
calloc 3 and malloc 3 do interact with the kernel to get memory if necessary

5994981
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
but very very few implementations of free 3 ever return memory to the kernel 1 they just add it to a free list that calloc and malloc will consult later in order to reuse the released blocks

5994981
free	malloc
malloc and free cooperate to maintain a directory

5994981
free	malloc
the alternative is a bit more shared-memory and paging-friendly and it involves allocating memory specifically for the directory. malloc and free have little if any ability to enforce access to individual blocks even when special and optional debugging code is compiled into the program

5994981
free	malloc
finally the few programs that do return large amounts of memory are likely to bypass malloc and simply allocate and free pages anyway

5994990
google-chrome	firefox
this is working on google-chrome and firefox

5995234

5995381
pull	push
you should be able to effectively treat each repository as a discrete entity and push and pull between them to get them in sync although really it seems like you only want to be pulling changes from one to form your main repo and get it up to date before pushing and pulling to other dev repo s again

5995381
put	get
as a suggestion to get started it s probably going to be easiest if you put the two repositories together on the one machine put them in separate directories you don t want to accidentally copy one over the other

clang	llvm
i m using clang llvm 2.9 which does not have this symbol while google does turn up some older headers that do include it

5995614
put	get
edit to add you can sort the array in place in o n at best in which case you can get the n highest values very quickly but the requirement is to not change position of the elements so you d have to start with a copy of the array if you wanted to do that or preserve ordering information so you could put everything back afterward

5995617
portrait	landscape
this view has autoresizing masks set up properly and rotates fine when the orientation changes from portrait to landscape

6012189
width	margin
the only problem in my way is that after pressing an a4j commandbutton most of my h outputlabel s are shortened by 3 pixels these pixels were to the left of the text which is unusual since the left padding margin and border width are all 0px

6012194

things in the subprocess module need a file object with a fileno callable attribute for stdin stdout and stderr which only files with a file descriptor real files should implement

you should wrap the fileinputstream with a bufferedinputstream before wrapping with a gzipinputstream rather than using a bufferedreader

6012259
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
add a bufferedinputstream between the fileinputstream and the gzipinputstream

6012278

uiview	calayer
there may be some confusion i know there was for me when you see that uiview s and their posterity all are automatically layer backed and have a calayer property

6012285
uiview	calayer
never-the-less it is evident that uiview is somehow overriding the implicit animation mechanism of its calayer property

6012285
uiview	calayer
so if you want implicit animations you must use calayer s directly not just suppose that because uiview has a calayer property that it will behave the same

6012312
multiplying	multiplication
you get kind of shaky when you get to things like multiplying because there are actually multiple kinds of multiplication operators -- there s vector product and dot product which are fundamentally very different

6012511
mef	prism
using mef for the add-in architecture over prism can be cleaner because the reasons for each project are vastly different and mef has a cleaner model i think it can also act as a basic ioc container

6012511
vsto	add-in
i also have a project vsto contrib which may also help you out especially if you have ribbon s and other things registered via add-in

6012516
config	ini
apart from being one of the best command-line option processors in any language it also supports reading config data from files with a syntax like ini and using environment variables

post	get
to do this you ll want to either introduce get post data call or use a different path for your ajax requests call

6012566
getter	setter
there are also cases where two methods are so trivial that i would test them together like setter getter

6012586
multiplying	add
if the block-items are dynamic in quantity you could always count them with jquery on document ready and multiplying their quantity by 50px or whatever their width is and add the width of the container-article 800px or whatever its width is and then set the parent containers width to that

6012603
hash	md5
you could use hash such ass md5 random number or you could go all out and make a guid

6012620

i m using a for-loop to accomplish this however whenever the socket encounters a time out loops breaks

6012667
super	extends
just because you extends a class doesn t mean you can cast from the super type

6012688

i have seperate views for portrait and landscape views

6012796
portrait	landscape
the portrait view showns a single page and the landscape viewer shows 2 pages

6012876
post	get
what command was it in c# where you could get the values of let s say multiple textboxes sharing the same name property in a form on post

6012889
terminate	timeout
that block takes just over 5 000 ms to execute instead of what i expect to be a few ms so it seems to have to do with a default future timeout - and the program does not actually terminate

see the getter in property initializer and setter in property initializer rows

6012940
post	get
thanks to rod s answer on this post i ve got the dashed line going but am not sure where to start to get it moving

int	double
note that there is no such thing as a double or even int in javascript a variable s type is defined by its value

6013032
getter	setter
it gets a bad score of 0.94 because each getter and setter doesn t access all of the other instance fields

6013032
getter	setter
i am not understanding this metric why should it include getter and setter

6013032
getter	setter
a getter and setter will always only access one single instance field

6013055
post	get
but once i make another request get post wherever to the server i need a new context because my context is dependant from .net httpcontext

6013066
unix	solaris
i am trying to port some c++ code from windows to solaris unix

6013077
jboss	glassfish
you need an j2ee server which depending on the complexity of your application might be a jsp servlet engine like apache tomcat or a full-blown j2ee application server like glassfish jboss or even a commercial product like oracle fusion middleware suite which also includes features like user management ldap server sigle-sign-on server farm management tools etc

6013104

6013131
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
when pressed a nested gridview repeater or datalist is used in place of a custom row

you can clone an existing row using client-side javascript to add rows so that the rendering of a row is consistent across rows generated server-side and rows created client-side

6013333
min	max
that can be used to to determine the min and max

6013333
min	max
i sort the lists so i can easily select the min and max values

6013585
int	double
exception when comparing an int double and int int

6013664
int	double
when you look at the il-code that those two snippets produce you ll realize that vb.net first converts the int values to double applies the division and then rounds the result before it s converted back to int32 and stored in y

6013729
post	get
this should issue a normal post request with single data parameter - so on server side you can use context.request.form data to get json string and then use any json de-serializer javascriptserializer josn.net to get the object

qxmlstreamwriter can very well write to qstring directly since it was introduced in qt 4.3 no need to add the extra chance of getting the encoding wrong with a qbytearray

6014104
int	boolean
i m not sure that you have a valid model using either int or boolean

6014251
submit	submission
the easy one is to reset the session variable on every non-postback request but this will allow the user to submit a post on one page load another page than hit refresh on the first one thus submission the comment twice but not being able to add a comment on the second page any longer

6014260

but generally it is not a good idea to put data into a session unless absolutely necessary because it is cached for a long time and there is no mechanism to get it out of the memory before the session times out

6015204

the prefered way for session scoped data is to add it to the session and add a transient binding to a method that returns this data or creates a new instances if it is not yet available

for small allocations malloc implementations keep track of mapped unused memory subdividing the unused memory as necessary to match the requests from the user code and requesting new memory pages from the kernel whenever no suitable free memory block is found

6016058

it works in google-chrome safari because they also send the variable contactsubmit if you set a value-attribute for the image-submit but the occurence of this variable isn t reliable as you see

6017133
implements	extends
make an employee class with field name and id then make a class which implements listcellrenderer and extends jlabel

6017206

the other way of doing is just hide the child and show the child instead by visible property instead of removing and adding

6017212
sdl	devil
i don t know the sdl library well i suppose it can load and save images but for loading and saving images you can use the openil devil library it is quite simple and supports many formats

6017238
serializable	deserialization
if you want to save and load the documents from one file then you need to combine them into a single document for serializable deserialization

6017239
integer	unsigned
in the fragment shader we then just take a bit pattern as unsigned integer though 32-bit in contrast to gllinestipple s 16-bit value and the stretch factor of the pattern and just take the texture coordinate well no texture anymore actually but nevermind modulo 32 to get it s position on the pattern those explicit uint s are annoying but my glsl compiler says implicit conversions between int and uint are evil

you also have a lot of advantages using maven integration with partcover ncover stylecop fxcop gendarme etc

6017510
flex	robotlegs
most of the flex frameworks swiz robotlegs etc provide a nice way to externalize the channel config to an xml file

6017512
serializable	deserialization
so it doesn t look like the resulting xml would be very robust when it comes to deserialization as far as i understand with the standard protocol buffer serializable things will continue working fine if you change the field names but keep the tag values the same and then try to deserialize a byte sequence that was serializable before these changes

6017515
versioning	upgrade
if the versioning numbers are different you know the app was updated and you can take whatever action is appropriate as part of the upgrade

6017515
versioning	upgrade
i would recommend against trying to determine the versioning upgrade based purely on the date time on the device as there are many possible issues to consider and work around

6017525

dbms-agnostic ie. works with postgresql just as well as mysql

6018196

6018313
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it shows but in ie 8 it does not show

6018325

your compareto implementation must return 0 if rhs is the same as this this object and the object being compared are equals

6018691

6019634
pop-up	dialog
you ll notice that by default the autoopen attribute is set to true so the standard behavior is to pop-up the dialog automatically on page load

from that file here s a few of the protocols that can be sent over either tcp or udp there are exactly 100 listed protocols that use both in the file many internal ms protocols

6019819
put	get
is there a way to reliably get a unique e-mail address from one put in from a user

6019822
accessor	properties
i always use the properties accessor because then your code is more prepared for changes down the road

6019822
accessor	properties
additionally if you use the properties accessor throughout the class you can then change the implementation of the properties down the road and you ll only have to change code in one place

6019823

here s the situation i have a uitabbarcontroller as my root view there are 2 tabs both have a uinavigationcontroller setup so i can push views as needed

6020222
viewdidload	viewdidappear
here s the problem though if the user starts the application and selects an item in tab 1 tab 2 appears but the values of the search display text don t get set - because viewdidload and viewdidappear are called in another thread so the execution of queuesearchbytype withdata gets called while the view is still loading and setting up

i cannot use simple db functions like modulo or division as it is very time consuming

6020413
httpconnection	downloading
i using httpconnection so the downloading is not done with the getinputstream

6020432
stdout	stderr
maybe a small perl program what copy stdin into stdout and print his progress to stderr

this way select performance should be fast and i would just have to do a post select cast to get the data into the proper data type

6020445
pop-up	dialog
i ve used a solution that pop-up a modal dialog with the default indefinite animating loading circle spinning around while the task is running

6020449
pop-up	dialog
a better approach might be to pop-up a dialog with the data to be changed

6020495
jar	manifest.mf
i ve verified that the class-path inside my apps jar manifest.mf is correct

6020516
navigationcontroller	modalviewcontroller	parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller	parentviewcontroller	modalviewcontroller
at a minimum you would need to override or mix in replacement getters for parentviewcontroller splitviewcontroller navigationcontroller tabbarcontroller and interfaceorientation and probably also modalviewcontroller

6020516
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
for example will any of them break if they have a parentviewcontroller but their navigationcontroller tabbarcontroller and splitviewcontroller are all nil

6020518
trie	tree
for a m-way tree instead of your bit array why not just store the binary trie id using m bits per level with each node

6020530
folder	directory
i m currently setting up an include statement and php files from different folder need to include the same files namely top directory public_html include head.php

6020530

on the other hand actual uses for such characters ascii characters before spaces other than tab carriage return and linefeed iirc are relatively rare - you may find you re okay just to strip them

6020540
getter	setter
you can use a private field with a public getter but no setter

i generally use interfaces are too enforce a common behavior that a group of classes share whereas subclassing is more appropriately used in cases where you can achieve serious code re-use through inherited functions properties

6020745
entities	entitymanager
the entitymanager is the public interface through which you access your entities however your entities reside in a context attached to your entitymanager

6020756

3 getter and setter are evil

6021091
getter	setter
evil evil...don t write getter and setter .

6021091
getter	setter
in python this getter and setter is silly because you can start with a normal attribute and change your mind at any time without affecting any clients of the class

6021109

google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that when the 3 select box are rendered after the ajax call they lose the decoration and become unusable in firefox google-chrome etc

6021268
cpython	pypy
if it does you d be better off writing c or letting cpython do that for you with static type annotations to make it really count using pypy their jit can completely remove such lookups and many more things even memory allocations in certain loops etc

6021268
getter	setter
when you write python you don t write getter or setter methods

i should add that the attached dependency properties is defined in a class which inherited from radcontextmenu which is a dependencyobject i have been reading and somewhere it is suggested that this can t work if the attached properties is defined in such a class but this seems strange

6021523
getter	setter
python allows you to access attributes directly without getter setter methods and if you need to do so you can use properties to ensure that your own code getter setter is executed implicitly

6021539
int	chars
i m fairly new to c and have started out writing a small library with functionality to get length of strings reversing strings converting binary data in chars buffers to int and shorts

6021539
unsigned	short
charstoushort converts a char array pointer with two bytes not counting null term of binary data into a unsigned short

6021539
int	chars
charstouint converts a chars array pointer with four bytes not counting null term of binary data into a unsigned int

6021559
hide	show
alternatively if this is a dynamic thing where checking a checkbox show the section and clicking again hide it then you will want to use javascript

6021569
tabcontrol	tabitem
personally i would have the tabcontrol items property bound to a collection of viewmodels that host a tabitem

6021611

6021813
apache	nginx
why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

6021820
ant	maven
it supports ant maven and command-line usage

the method returns a number of orientations beyond the portrait and landscape orientation

6022147
orientdb	neo4j

uiview	subviews
you need to do your drawing in drawrect and you need to make imageclass a uiview subclass and add it as a subviews

6022851

this would need to work and be accessible from all other separate computers and would need to keep the same directory structure from the server and have the same folder names and everything as is expected by the solution project files

6022904
innodb	myisam
the biggest advantage of innodb over myisam is that innodb supports transactions rollbacks

6022942

the usual scenario is that you do a pull before you push up your changes

6024011

min	max
you could also change the min to max and make it perform tehdiv.height 100 at that point

in google-chrome and firefox you can workaround this limitation by using a function as the second argument of the replace function

neither c++ not c perform arithmetical computations withing smaller int types like chars and short

6025107
int	chars
on some exotic platform where the range of int does not cover the range of unsigned chars the type unsigned int will be used as target type for promotion

6025598
hash	salt
so for now i m just putting a random hash and salt in so no one including me knows the actual password

6025613
post	get

6025618
ironruby	ironpython
you might want to look at a dlr -based language like ironpython or ironruby

6025631

6025778
width	height
the computed width and height do not include the title bar menu bar status bar or toolbar s - but may include the horizontal and vertical scrollbar s if any

6025778
width	height
if the user resizes the browser window you may need to recompute the width and height use window.onresize to do so

6025778
width	height
similarly if the user zooms in or zooms out you may also need to recompute the width and height

6025843
put	get
note that i m using the c++ deque here but anything that lets you put items on the back and get them from the front will work fine

6025845
innodb	myisam
it might possible make sense in some cases for myisam tables i would not recommend to use it anyway because a value for auto_increment column will be generated differently if it s a part of composite index but not for innodb engine

public	protected
i know the public private and protected are mutually exclusive which reduces the combinations somewhat

6026823
public	protected
i read in the hex value of the access flag and then increment a counter depending on if it is public private or protected

6026823
public	protected
i thought of doing modulo on the access flag and the appropriate hex value for public private or protected but public is 0x0001 so that won t work

visitor	crtp
depending on your particular use case this might be too complex if static polymorphism like crtp would work or too hard to maintain if the hierarchy is big for each new element in the base hierarchy you will have to update all types in the hierarchy of the visitor so if you can avoid this complexity perfect

6028435
google-chrome	firefox
the problem only seemed to occur with google-chrome and firefox

6028441
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome same engine as safari some slight differences in vendor extensions supported

6028524
folder	directory
i thought this was quite a sensible approach until i discovered that visual studio 2010 hickups under this approach if two .cpp files have the same name albeit in different folder and namespaces because all .obj files are placed into the same temp directory debug or release

6028526
implements	extends
in java can i somehow force a class that extends an abstract class to implements its constructor with a object as a parameter

6028677
getter	setter
i have a quick question on best practice and if getter and setter are the best option in a specific case

6028677

6028789
set	bag
if some lines may occur multiple times you have to use a bag instead of a set

6028797
client-side	server-side
you could use client-side javascript validation and back that up with server-side php validation too but if you set the forms post target to be the same page that generates the form so _server request_uri you could call the validation object class in a statement like

6028829
rel	alt

the width and height of the centred content would be known

6028933
width	height
that fiddle does include the image width and height but if you remove them and the positioning for the sub text it does or should show that whatever is in the middle does stay centered

6028933
width	height
note i ve left your widths intact but you can test without widths height by removing the height width off #c and also remove the css for the #c div text div - in a plain text scenario entering text into either of these divs should auto centre

6028958

width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
actualwidth and actualheight are 0 before the labels are displayed width height is not set because i wish the labels to size themselves basing on their contents desiredsize returns either 0 correct size or size exceeding the real label size like 2 or 3 times rendersize returns either valid size or 0 and it is like first label returns valid size and second one - 0.0 without any noticeable reason

6029347
actualheight	actualwidth
after invoking this method actualwidth and actualheight will have the correct values

6029362
int	boolean
in particular config4j provides type-safe lookup that is get operations for built-in types such as string boolean int float and durations such as 500 milliseconds or 2.5 days

6029362
int	boolean
so you would have to convert an int boolean float int-denoting-duration whatever value into a string and then insert that into the config4j object

keep in mind you don t see the modernizr classes when you view the source you need a tool like firebug on firefox or the developer tools on google-chrome to actually inspect the post-javascript code

6029621
int	double
reading your motivation again it seems like you want a function where an in int can be equal to an in double

6029627

width	height
furthermore any event type can be passed in and the following jquery methods can be called val css html text data width height or offset

6037434
width	height
at the very least it is a documentation bug that jquery doesn t acknowledge the conflict between the legitimate height and width properties and the jquery methods of the same name

6037434
width	height
the .attr method works correctly with respect to width and height

6037434
width	height

6037501
children	parent
code i have so far but it only gets the parent and children no grandchildren

6037509
strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strtok	strncpy	strtok
frankly the best way to split up the string is to use any one of the standard library functions strtok strchr or strcspn and use either strcpy or strncpy to copy the substring to the destination arrays

6037529
put	get
now if i try to put the app into background and bring it back with a url sys call i get a print out of 4a40032 which in binary is 0000 0100 1010 0100 0000 0000 0011 0010 and i have my ishandlingurl bit turned on

6037801
min	max
with the other implementation it varies between min corepoolsize and max maxpoolsize

6037804
profiler	aqtime
i ve used aqtime 7 pro and .net memory profiler but neither of them seem to make it clear what is causing the issue

children	parent
besides containing properties for each datum in the node i ve included parent and children properties plus methods to add a child and to get a child

comparator	comparable
a well-behaved comparable should implement an equals method that is consistent with its comparator method

6038254
cout	cin
almost everything is read by the console cin and written to the console cout

6038254

6038958
for-loop	loops
perhaps i m not aware of how for-loop index variables get scoped but i was very surprised when one of my loops didn t complete seemingly because a function called from within a loops contained an i for its for-loop index as well

6043577
mouseover	mouseout
both mouseover and mouseout bubble and so if your fruit element has child elements you ll receive events from them as well which tends to destabilize this kind of animation

6043598

getter	setter
there doesn t need to be an image property declared for a class to have a setimage method--a property can be implied to exist by the existence of setter getter

6043711
integer	fractions
or you could build a block which uses slice blocks to separate the integer and fractions parts and increment the integer part if the fractions part is not zero

6043766
primefaces	richfaces	primefaces	icefaces	richfaces	icefaces
the benefits of using any jsf component library richfaces icefaces primefaces etc... is that you get a feature rich control set with a good deal of ajax functionality built into many of its controls

6043832
ddms	adb
1 goto ddms select reset adb nearby camera icon in the down arrow icon menu

6043867
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
also think that when you start up your server you probably want to automatically start your application and apache nginx lighttpd .

6043871
getter	setter
by the way i would rather have a simple field with getter and setter and annotate the field instead

6043913
children	parent
the naive algorithm for this would be to loop through the list of parent and then get the children for each parent in a different query either against the db or the dataset

6043923
exponent	modulo
in rsa you can choose a very short exponent e for encryption but the exponent d foe decryption will probably be 1024 bit long for an modulo with 1024bit

6044020
put	get
either code snippet provided could just as easily use p2p or pub sub to put and get messages

6044020

i want to set the two checkbox field isapproved and isdeleted to true when a button like edit is set

6044232
post	get
if you re using the post method you should look into the request.form to get the parameters passed

6044251
swt	swing
because we are doing a lot of work in a feature-branch convert from using swing to swt to be specific and have to keep it as short as possible

6044259
sorting	filtering
i would also think that even if i had this input on the top level grid that sorting the top level grid or filtering if there were filtering would destroy this input

6044259
sorting	filtering
meaning that the actual rows of the grid are literally sorted filtering paged etc. client side so that any client side changes such as adding text to a text box adding a css class to an object or in a more complex example adding a reference to a javascript object to an object via jquery would persist after sorting paging and filtering

6044320
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari still hide my link

6044321
apache	nginx
you can spread the static files to different directories by file name and set up rewrite rules in your web server mod_rewrite on apache basic location matching with regexp on nginx and similar on other web servers

6044430
coalesce	nullif
i have used the option andriy m posted using coalesce and nullif functions

6044441
filesystems	ntfs
goal is to find the drive on the local machine where we execute with the most available free space that has been formatted to ntfs filesystems excluding the systemdrive volume if possible

6044472
sorting	filtering
running sorts after filtering is a good idea anyway as you reduce the cost of sorting which is always super-linear

6044477
width	height
i also want to check the width and height of the image

6044517
width	height
the bitmap will hold the height and width of the image

6044590
subobject	instances
but when you allocate d the c subobject refers to the instances of a that came with b so it s offset is different

6044600
post	get
i get 404 response for custom post types and anywhere that a custom rewrite rule has been applied custom feed links

6044600
post	get
however i still get these pages 404 ing every now and then - i suspect when a new post is added

6044620

or i think if you use a scriptmanager and an updatepanel it refills the box after a postback

6044633
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

6044668
int	double
now on both 32bit and 64bit that precision is even not possible using a double let alone using an int

6044669
put	get
when using the zend mvc project structure you get an added autoloader translating _ to all classes are named like zend_form and put in a file called form.php inside the zend directory so that when calling new zend_form - the autoloader looks for zend form.php

6044686
viewdidload	viewdidappear
would i be better to create a new class with nib for the search bar and buttons which would then have a viewdidload viewdidappear and i could then create a delegate function so i could dequeue the text to go into the search bar

6044707
google-chrome	firefox
this works like a charm in firefox however i have a few problems with it in google-chrome

6044707
google-chrome	firefox
this does not happen with firefox so it s most likely google-chrome which is causing it or perhaps even webkit

6044768
for-loop	arrays
this happens behind the scenes if we use the enhanced for-loop with arrays

6044768
for-loop	arrays
so practically spoken we can t use the variable declared in the enhanced for-loop to modify the underlying arrays

6044775
nhibernate	automapper	automapper	structuremap
we sped up our tests quite a bit by making sure that structuremap automapper nhibernate and others were only initialized once for all unit tests executed

whether you do this through maven ant etc. doesn t matter

6045054
decltype	using-declaration
how can i for that decltype select the type that will be selected through a local using-declaration and adl

6045125
getter	setter
after a bit of research i found that magento generates all the getter and setter pragmatically through extensive use of the __call function which is called when a function that isn t defined is called

6045125
getter	setter
to modify functionality of a getter or setter simply define the function you want to modify in your rewrite of the class and this will be called before the __call essentially rewriting the default functionality in a roundabout way

6045138
folder	directory
what i did was i removed the reference deleted the dll from the bin folder copied the latest version of the dll to a new directory different from the location it was previously being referenced from and referenced it from the new directory

6045182
google-chrome	firefox
the basic approach is to build your blob however you want google-chrome webkit firefox has a responseblob on xmlhttprequest so you can use that create an iframe hidden display none then assign the src of the iframe to be the blob

6045196
ant	maven
but you can also compile swcs from the command line ant or maven

6045235
put	get
but i don t know how to get it to find out which folder to put the files in at build time

6045250

switching	airplane
when trying to resolve a host name just after 3g connection is established eg. switching airplane mode off and on i get the following error host not found authoritative

queue	fifo
every 5 min on average but it can at the same time a set of 8-15 functions to be executed is being sent to the backend queue for processing fifo

6045516
mp3	wav
you will probably need to wrap the mp3 function and the wav function together using inheritance and a simple wrapper function if you want one method to run both types of files

6045521
post	get
api teens with an http get would return a list of all teens and api teens with an http post would insert a new teen

6045521
put	get
to round out the crud operations using http get would return a specific teen with an http put would update a teen using the values passed in the request body and called with http delete would delete the specified teen

6045523
put	get
and put that in jtable but when i click i get error

6045560

post	get
you need to actually submit the form via an http post and get the value1 and value2 values from the post request body then use them in your jsp java code

6045814
fadein	hide
the obvious solution is to set display none as you have or to call hide before your call to fadein if you are sure the element is hidden

6045832
base-class	subclassing
i have also considered setting the base property in the subclassing constructor and set methods but there is no way for the subclassing property to be updated if the base-class s property is updated

6045839

don t you just mean ord and chr

6045971
put	get

in sql i can do a subquery with group by topic taking max post.date and then make an inner join with the post table to get the latest post record from each topic

6046371
folder	directory
the proper way to get the current directory is using a library that provides folder support

6046425

i ve inherited a big mess of code where the original developer decided to forego using inherited in favor of enums and switch statements...it s a perfect example of this anti-pattern now it s time to refactor and i ve decided the best way to go about it is to pull out a superclass backed by a table with shared columns and then use the joined subclassing inherited strategy

since the only sane way to provide that is to make some classes or interfaces accessible you can just as well provide an interface or abstract class that they need to implements extends

6056223
implements	extends
alternatively you can go around by not forcing your users to extends a class or implements an interface but have them provide a function with a certain signature -- which then you can call via reflection

6056262
multiplying	division
these can be compared to multiplying by 2 x left-shift or divinding by 2 x right-shift but it should be noted that a binary shift is much faster than a division operation

int	double
otherwise if any argument corresponding to a double parameter has type double or an int type then all arguments corresponding to double parameters are effectively cast to double

6056589
min	max
also there is a slight simplification - the subquery that finds the mid can return null if certain category does not have enough values so there should be coalesce of that to some constant that would make sense in the comparison in your case it would be min of domain of the val in article it is max

how to get rid of the message mentioned in the title of the post

6056598
floating-point	integer
i don t know how math.random operates but i m willing to bet that the shift of its floating-point returned value right by 0 turns that number into an integer because shifting left and right has arithmetic meaning only when the operand is an integer

6058341
listbox	icollectionview
the fact that you raise the propertychanged event does refresh the binding but then it realizes that it s the same instance of as before so it reuses the same icollectionview as the itemssource and the content of the listbox isn t refreshed

6058346
put	get
and for this all objects are custom objects so if we put it in nslogs we get structure like customobject-hexcode

6059307
min	max
the problem i m having is that i ve defined a custom validator attribute to check the max and min length of a string property stringlengthinrangeattribute

6059370
vb.net	vb6
very few problems like this get well-engineered exhaustive solutions that can be trusted not to regress functionality like commercial vb6 to vb.net converters that could justify spending enormous effort because of the sheer volume of potential customers out there and where you can pick up a phone or a lawyer if something goes wrong so if such a tool existed you should be extremely careful

6059385
post	get
if not you could pass the data as a get or post variable and then use this to generate the select box options on the new page

6059402
hide	show
i would approach this by adding a release flag to your releases and a condition see the conditions tab in the lower right when you re on the dialog s behavior node to hide or show the checkbox if isreleaseflags does or does not contain the appropriate flags

6059406
loops	if-statement
if-statement loops and plain old

6059447
for-loop	arrays

6059531
primefaces	icefaces
i ve tried icefaces and primefaces and finally chose primefaces due to zero-configuration start-up simplicity with the use of components and the good great integration with jquery

6059531
primefaces	icefaces
i only miss a good support for server-push in primefaces while this is well supported in icefaces

6059531
primefaces	icefaces
i also liked the one-jar dependency in primefaces while icefaces needs at least three jar libraries to work

6059534
temp	tmp
you should definitely not use the tmp temp folder for this

6059556
google-chrome	firefox
i ve just tested firefox 4 google-chrome 11 and ie 9 and they all work fine

6059565
width	height
just change height and width

6059702
width	height
there are no units used in html width and height attributes

6059709
post	get
here s the problem i need to create a link button - whatever - and post get the values for the specific record that i ll choose

6059709
post	get
but whenever the resultset returns more than 1 records the post get method grabs the data for the last record

6059756
post	get
if you are using the same name for each set of hidden inputs there is no way for to tell them apart when you pass them with post or get your name field should be unique the last entry is the only one that is going through because as each one is added its essentially overwriting the past entries

6059756
post	get
the easiest way to make each entry go to a unique page is using a get as mentioned by paul weber multiple forms with post work but it gets messy quick

6059779
photoshop	paint.net
use photoshop paint.net or similar software and adjust hue

6059837

boost	stl
i use rather complex data structures mostly using stl containers in my app and serialize them using boost v1.34

6060216
getter	setter
below is a coldfusion 9 specific implementation using implicit getter and setter

6060216
int	double
the cfc overrides those setters for the int and double members to perform data type validation coldfusion does not do natively

6060241
min	max
i usally use max or min if a dbms hasn t an any aggregate function

6060260
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie indeed act like you mentioned but google-chrome do not and i d guess other webkit browsers would do the same

6060267
min	max
min and max are equally in expensive

6060295
outputstream	inputstream
so it sounds much like that you read write files using reader writer instead of inputstream outputstream

6060332
firefox	safari
it works in all other browsers firefox 3.6+ safari 5 ie 8

6060353
inherited	properties
note that the new object inherited the properties from the class it extends but it does not inherited any values of an instantiated a object

6060368
width	height
on mouseleftbuttondown if you are not rotating add a rectangle with its top left corner at the coordinates of the mouse and its height and width calculated by the difference between the top corner and the mouse coordinates

6060368
width	height
recalculate the width and height of the rectangle

6060368

6060414
min	max
min and max are proper aggregates.

6060414
postgresql	mysql
only mysql has this ambiguity of an any aggregate sql server sybase oracle postgresql do not

6060433
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
this is handled by tracking mousedown mouseup mousemove etc events on the row not the individual item

6060449
viewdidload	dealloc
i tried making a method and placing it in dealloc viewdidload viewdidunload but they only work when app has a fresh run closed from multitasking twice home button and quit there so it s useless

6060451
int	double
the maximum ones-representable int is 2 53 9007199254740992 for a 64-bit double and 2 24 16777216 for a 32-bit float

6060500
onclick	onfocus	onfocus	onblur

you don t really need to rotate as such - just adjust the height width and top-left of your rectangle based on your mouse position

6060581
equals	gethashcode
anonymous types do implement equals and gethashcode in a pretty normal way calling gethashcode and equals for each of their submembers

6060622

6060684
onclick	onmousedown
preventing onmousedown or onclick instead of ontouchstart

i know how to perform the serializable and deserialization however i am unsure how to integrate it into the design pattern

6061093
serializable	deserialization
what i don t like about this is that the serializable and deserialization functions will be in different places - one in the file for the declaration of the foo and bar objects and the other in the files for something else

6062239
width	margin
the top is given no margin and the left and right are set automatically in relation to the page containing element based on the width of the div

6062246
width	margin
margin 0 auto is not the same thing -- if the div has a fixed width margin 0 auto creates a div that is horizontally centered in its container

comparator	comparable
for the cases where you can t implement comparable or do not want to there is a class comparator which can be given to the sort methods sparately

6062836
free	malloc
the simple way to think about it is that every malloc must have a corresponding free

6062836
free	malloc
if you malloc a structure that holds pointers to other malloc ed items freeing that structure does not free the other items pointed to

that way the post is linked in so when it is edited or removed changes are reflected on all blogs and you can also get a quick list of all blogs a post is in using something like

6062934
minimum	max
it can be shown that i believe first by konig that the minimum number of colours required is same as the max degree and polynomial time algorithms are known inspite of the general problem being np-complete

6062934
minimum	max
in fact the edge colouring corresponds to the vertex colouring of the line graph of a bipartite graph which is known to be a perfect graph and thus the minimum number of colours is the max degree

6062949
pop-up	dialog
also this still causes a print dialog to pop-up

background-position	background-size
the background-position and background-size did the trick

lingpipe	lda
you might also consider the agglomerative clustering implementations available in lingpipe see although i suspect an lda implementation might prove somewhat more reliable

what i would like to know is if it is a better practice to get a pointer to the view that needs to be reset and then reset the properties that need to be reset right there in the app delegate or should i post an nsnotification that the app is entering the background and have the view controller do it s cleanup within itself

6063871
hash-collision	key
i think you mean by as small an amount possible to avoid a hash-collision since for example the next-highest-float may already be a key

your message class needs to inherited from inotifypropertychanged and the isread properties needs to raise the propertychanged event when modified

6064008

6064008
width	height
jquery runs its own width and height methods instead

6064008

imo the spec attributes should have been given priority especially since width and height can be set via css

why does initializing subclassing require calling the superclass #39

6064477
versioning	upgrade
i cancelled out of that and in the vs options i turned off upgrade to latest versioning of office

6064485
realloc	malloc
multiple malloc s realloc s will slow performance as well as reading through the entire file twice and on the other hand your worried about wasting memory it is your choice to decide or you can use all 3 setting a default and then implement command line flags to let the user decide which option if they so choose

6064486

be sure to report your findings here i never use vb6 or vba anymore - your detailed findings could help others with a long-standing annoyance

6066263
vb6	vba
though i have never debugged such vb6 issues in great detail it would seem that the problems result from applications that install common controls vb6 com files templates and vba files and libraries that conflict with existing files and registry settings and registrations on the box or some per-user registry key or userprofile file may need to be added once per user allow the self-repair to complete once and see if the problem goes away

maybe this is a stupid question but at the end of my pages i set all of the variables to null and then unset them for performance even though i know it probably has little to no effect on performance but even so would that have any effect on any caching modules such as varnish apc or memcached

i don t know php so min and max might have different syntax but you get the idea

6066328

onchange	onkeyup
your code doesn t work because the showmoreinfo x function assumes that the x parameter will be a reference to one or the other of the radio buttons but then your text input s onchange onkeyup whatever event is calling the same function and passing in a reference to itself - this is why it only works when you click the radio buttons

6067459
onchange	onkeyup
so as has been said already you can use onkeyup instead of onchange

6067459
onchange	onkeyup
but remember that there are several ways that the user can change the value in an input without using the keyboard thus no onkeyup drag-and-drop onto the input drag out will change the focus but if you re not using onchange any more...

put	get
for starters create a few different units based on categories - stringutils.pas mathutils.pas datetimeutils.pas etc - put your functions into those units according to category and be sure to include all the prototypes in your interface section so they ll be visible to other units but don t get too caught up in how to categorize things... and keep all your util units in a separate dedicated directory

when you add items to your silverlight project they don t get copied out to the clientbin folder of the hosting site even on build regardless of copy to output directory settings because this only dictates what makes it to the current project s bin folder - you ll need to copy these manually or eventually use a post-build step that is

by adding trace statements into the setter code in the entityframework matter object i can observe the casenoteslog children being correctly placed into the parent matter

6070252
client-side	server-side
the end result is that a matter object with a child casenoteslog object leaves my code on the client-side but although it looks like it is serializing deserializing correctly by the time i get to check the state of the object on the server-side the child records have gone

to modularize the application either prism or mef or both will be used

6070421
maven	m2e
the problem was that using m2e the maven dependency library is included in the war if built from eclipse or included if you are deploying the app to tomcat within eclipse and whilst the maven builds all still behave correctly m2e does not respect the scope of libraries so if you have provided scoped dependencies they will still be deployed so you can get these clashes

it should be like in safari or google-chrome address bar in fact for example

6070550
post	get
post the values to one of your pages and from this page make the real request on the server-side then return the value you get

6070609
google-chrome	firefox
i believe the error might be how firefox and google-chrome handles these multiple times included jquerys and it might be that google-chrome uses the older and firefox newer version

6070609
google-chrome	firefox
you should also tell what firefox version and google-chrome version you were using if the problem persists after deleting the extra jquerys

6071011
oncreate	onnewintent
in my case the problem was that i sometimes got two intents on application startup one in oncreate and then another in onnewintent

6071011
oncreate	onnewintent
the intent from oncreate had some really old data attached that should have been cleared according to the docs while the onnewintent had no extra data the correct case

6071011
oncreate	onnewintent
my solution was to record the last incoming intent assuming that the last intent is the correct one and then handle the intent in onresume since that method is called after oncreate and onnewintent

6071026
hide	show
it will hide this text select states and should show the list of the states

as you know the mediawiki extension lives in a directory named syntaxhighlight_geshi and contains a subdirectory geshi

6071140
geshi	mediawiki
if your patch is to the files not in geshi submit it to mediawiki s bugzilla

post	put
because when you use resources it will by default map the put protocol to the update action it will map the delete protocol to the destroy action and it will map the post protocol to the create action

6071147
serializable	deserialization
my current solution is to have the product perform the serializable and the concretebuilder perform the deserialization then put both the product and it s concretebuilder declarations into the same source file

6071181
queue	fifo
because a queue item can go invisible and then return to visibility later queue items don t necessary get processed in fifo order

6071193
width	height
you can also use layoutparams.fill_parent or layoutparams.wrap_content instead of height width

min	max	minimum	max
since you seem to want the minimum value of id for xx the original values of id for yy and the maximum value of id for zz edit though i now see that there is but one entry for zz so it could be min instead of max or it might be unaggregated it is not clear that we can really generalize for you

6071417
outputstream	inputstream
i have a piece of code to read a inputstream and write the content into an outputstream

6071431

6072126
keydown	keyup
also you can consider some of the other jquery events like keyup keydown or keypress

6072155
int	chars
why would you take the address of an int and then cast it as a chars pointer

6072155
int	chars
then why would even pass an int for the size to the same function you pass a chars to get set

6072157
min	max
however in general group by can only use indexes if you limit the aggregate functions used to min and max see and

6072160

inherited	subclassing
this will be inherited by all subclassing and will allow a caller to safely convert type

6072962
ant	maven
originally one of the big advantages maven had over ant was the ease of dependency management but you are right in that ivy has now come along to fit that gap meaning that ant+ivy provides some similar functionality to maven in terms of build and dependency management

6072962
ant	maven
some people prefer ant as it is more flexible powerful for custom task builds where as some people prefer maven as its a lot more succinct and simpler

6072962
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
it will depend on the complexity of your builds if you have basic java builds then maven might be more suited as the pom.xml files maven build filds are pretty simple but if you need to do a lot of custom specific stuff you may well end up having ant scripts to perform also if you already have one system in place there isnt necessarily a huge advantage of swapping

6072962
nexus	artifactory
also worth noting is that from my experience there are some alternatives to archiva such as nexus and artifactory which may be a better fit archiva wouldnt be my first choice in repo management - check out this discussion of differences between nexus artifactory should we use nexus or artifactory for a maven repo

innodb	myisam
another potential issue is if one machine is using mysql and you ve misconfigured to have myisam as the default storage engine rather than innodb or another engine that supports transactions

6074948
mouse	keyboard
as far as i know this is not possible with citrix xenserver newer versions of citrix xenserver have a gui if you want to use the screen mouse and keyboard whilst running vm s you either need to use the opensource version of xen from a linux distribution where a full version of linux is available to run the remote client software to connect to one of your vm s

6074948
vmware	virtualbox
personally i would not recommend this as citrix xen server is specifically cut down to provide a near bare metal experience for hosted virtual machines if this is for home use or testing purposes then i would suggest using a desktop virtualization technology instead such as virtualbox or similar offerings from vmware workstation or microsoft virtual pc depending on what it is that you want to achieve

6075120
google-chrome	firefox
however google-chrome and firefox don t show anything

6075150

this might be a bit of a guess but is it possible that your action does not have the httppost restriction on it so that somehow users are getting to it via a get rather than a post

6075959
udp	tcp
the fact you use a tcp connection instead of udp datagram can help you because of the three-way-handshake

6075959
udp	tcp
in fact most nat routers accept incoming tcp connection but not incoming udp packets

an easy solution would be to load just the div you want in a separate page use the jquery width and height functions on the div and then window.resizeto width height

post	get
boost log v2 is simply what you get by checking out trunk according to what andrey says in the post you link

udp	tcp
one solution might be to loop sending the udp datagram and trying the tcp connection on the other socket until the connection is made or some other time limit or maximum retry limit is reached

6076619

maybe you should add a function that you d call upon submission on submit

you could make a common activity which just handles onresume and onpause in a certain way and then make every activity extend from that one instead of activity directly

width	height
set the width on instead of the and use line-height instead of height on the

6077228
width	height
although since those numbers are based on screen resolution the height will always be less and the width will almost always be less so you may be better off with just

6077256
int	boolean
my vb.net program will generate some lists that may contain boolean int strings or more lists

6077256

the lists become arrays and int boolean and strings are read alright with ruby

6077258
integer	unsigned
there is a uinttostr to help converting the uint64 to string but no way to convert a 64 bit integer to a unsigned value as a string

6077258
integer	unsigned
this is normally not a big deal but it can happen that a user needs to input a value as an unsigned integer which must be stored into the registry as a 64 bit unsigned integer value

6077701
id3v2	id3-tag
i ve found this question answer to a very similar problem how do you edit video id3v2 tags in java it describes how to use a library intended for audio files called jid3 to edit video id3-tag but i can t figure out for the life of me how to actually import it into an eclipse project and use it

6078471
inline	inlining
if the standard allowed that copy to be elided when the code is inline it would imply that the behavior of a program would differ due to the compiler and not user code --the inline keyword does not force inlining it only means that multiple definitions of the same function do not represent a violation of the odr

6078477
serializable	deserialization
so you probably just need to specify generic type of object on deserialization for serializable it is not needed as runtime type is available

6078522
client-side	server-side
you must utilize javascript if you want to do it client-side and any of the server-side ones php python ruby if you want to do it that way

6078524
google-chrome	safari
what version of google-chrome is equivalent to safari 4

6078530

it wouldn t be pretty because the mousedown location does not necessarily indicate where the mouseup will be but it is generally true

6078869
fish	zsh	fish	ash
the csh zsh ash and fish are different

6078889
inherited	properties
i would probably use postsharp and create an inherited attribute injecting interception code into all public properties

inherited	subclassing
marking the attribute as inherited should also attach it to all subclassing automatically

6078911

joining and grouping seem to be fairly straight forward however when i finally try to get the select statement going and put all of the various fields from both tables things seem to fall apart for me

google-chrome	firefox
illustrative of this position relative has the desired effect on google-chrome 13 but not on firefox 4

6079269
hash	salt
i would avoid making the salt something user-controlled such as the user s password hash since if the user changes that information changes their password the checksum will no longer validate

6079275
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i seem to have a slight issue with some spacing in between my lines between firefox and safari google-chrome

lzma	lz77	lzma	lzw	lz77	lzw
however many byte-oriented text compression algorithms -- lz77 lzw lzma deflate etc

6079311
children	parent
actually the proper way to do this is when you first create a parentvm you iterate through the children of the passed-in parent creating a childvm for each then add those childvm objects to the parentvm s childvms property

6079311
children	parent
you then also have to listen for change-notification to the actual parent s children collection and update your childvms collection accordingly

6079323
vim	emacs
emacs+vimpulse is awesome but i think its right workflow is to liberally use emacs commands in combination to vim shortcuts

6079323
vim	emacs
for example emacs s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than vim s qq and q

6079359
width	height
obviously i can just increase the height width of the button by twice the padding but i want to understand why there s a discrepancy

6079380
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if i remember right ie reads the and firefox google-chrome opera safari read the although i believe a couple browsers would fallback successfully to the

free	malloc
in theory you are not allowed to malloc or free there although in practice the default linux allocator is safe and linux libraries came to rely on it end result is that you must use the default allocator

6079593
next	except
i think it means that pypdf opened the file did its attempt at text processing raised whatever exception did the except block but is now unable to go to the next step b c it doesn t know that the file has eneded

6079785
int	chars
where as int writes the chars c into the file fp and returns the chars written or eof for an error

6079787
pull	push
the xmlpullparser version has some more overhead from sax since it needs to turn the underlying push semantics into a pull interface

6079787
pull	push
if it helps -- push means that it pushes the parsed data to you callbacks you implement giving you each tag and other document element while pull means you make calls to the parser to retrieve each element

6079790
filtering	grouping
column grouping tools filtering tools printing tools ..

6079812
post	get
the only practical way of pulling transaction status updates from authorize without using their silent post feature which seems like a big bag of nightmares is to get a batch list of settled transactions for let s say a day and then pull transaction lists for every settled batch

6079814
put	get
if you do ungetc on a stream fp and then you do a getc again you get back the same character you just put in

6079821
put	get
ungetc put something back into the input buffer so the next time you call getc or fgetc etc. that s what you ll get

6079821

6079872
org.json	gson	org.json	jackson	gson	jackson
as the object model gets more complicated the org.json style code veers towards unreadable whereas the gson jackson style object mapping is still just plain java objects

6079927

6080340
post	get
for example someone could write a mechanized scraper that sends a get or post request directly to your server-side script

6080383
tcplistener	tcpclient
network programming with the socket class is a lot easier in my opinion then using tcplistener and tcpclient

6080383
tcplistener	tcpclient
the reason i say this is that it is already a really good and easy to use implementation and by using tcplistener and tcpclient where they create further abstraction lessenes your ability to understand what is going on in my opinion

6080409
many-to-many	one-to-many
the relations between person and document is one-to-many and person and address is many-to-many

you need to do that too with malloc and remember to free it

6080789

orm s for instance will easily be able to find your properties but it will be harder for them to find the getter setter because the convention is to use the properties

6080926
ninject	spring.net
it has built-in everything you mention and integrates with many popular ioc containers windsor structuremap unity spring.net ninject so you will not have to re-invent the wheel and start focusing on your business logic

are there any static code analysis tools for delphi pascal

6082246
fgets	strncmp
while fgets buffer sizeof buffer stdin strncmp buffer stop 4

6082257
subtract	add
the reason you initially subtract the one and then add it on is because modulus works best on zero-based numbers while yours are one-based

6082257
subtract	add
the subtract add is to turn your scheme into zero-based before performing the modulus then turning it back into one-based afterwards

6082309
width	margin
traditionally you would set a width on the and then add margin 0 auto which centers the whole thing

negate is the unary negation and then there s the binary addition and multiplication operators

6082640
subtraction	addition
or can binary subtraction be implied because it could be made up combining addition and negation which we have

6082640
subtraction	addition
the implied subtraction from having addition and negation is a pretty handy feature too

when you are subclassing in objective-c you must 1 override the designated initializer 2 call the designated initializer of the superclass

6083124
width	height
i also checked simple nsopenglview examples and they also have the same problem so i am pretty certain that it s not a bug in my code but rather a problem with a view that has 100 width and height

6083126
put	get
then when you get back to an appropriate zoom level you can use setmap again to put the markercluster back on the map

6083126
post	get
hopefully this is all you need to get this done but if not post some of your code and maybe we can try to be more specific about exactly how to modify it to achieve this

6083136
put	get
get code from each line and create file put reference to opened file stream to dictionary with code as a key

6083139
xsl-fo	xslt
if the nl characters are present then your question is most probably only xsl-fo - related and not xslt one

6083166
cvs	svn
similiar to how github displays directories or how viewvc displays a directory in a svn cvs repo

6083310

rss	feed
iphone tutorial creating an rss feed reader

6083430
apache	nginx
i was testing my site with jmeter to see how hundred threads would affect site performance and tested it with apache and mod_php and nginx with fastcgi

6083430
apache	nginx
i noticed that the bottlebeck was always cpu in both apache and nginx

6083447
apache	nginx
the reason php is taking up more resources than your web servers is that php is doing a lot more work and does so in an intepreted language apache and nginx is both compiled into cpu instructions

6083464
tolower	toupper
so when you compare you need to compare using either tolower or toupper to make sure that your value is right

6083602
superclass	subclassing
when a method in subclassing has same name and arguments their types number and order as the method in superclass then the method in subclassing overrides the one in superclass

6083602
superclass	subclassing
now for the overriding to be allowed the return type of the method in subclassing must comply with that of the method in superclass

6083602
superclass	subclassing
this is possible only if the return type of the method in subclassing is covariant with that of the method in superclass

6083629
super	self
incidentally please don t do super self.__class__ self

6083629
inherited	subclassing
you should always explicitly name the current class when using super otherwise any subclassing that inherited from yours and in turn calls super will break

6083629
super	self
that s why you should always name the class you re in - in this case super somemodeladmin self

6083644
textarea	textbox
note however that making a selection like this will only check the length of the first textbox textarea it finds not each of them

6083680
sorting	grouping
i find the existing answers to be a bit lacking normally one would not process collections or boil their items down to a string at the very best you would do some dynamic manipulation using a collectionview sorting grouping but normally you use data templating to display the individual items which allows you to use all their properties

6083681
width	height
width and height seems fine

6083706
gif	png
if it s just a few images consider converting them to jpg png or gif manually depending on what type of image they contain

i haven t chosen the analysis package yet so if you have a recommendation and that recommendation is best used with either pytables or pandas or whatever please factor that in to your response

6083776
maven	pom.xml
you should invoke mvn package or right-click maven package and obtain a war file - the in the pom.xml must be war

6083792
children	parent
often you have a transformgroup then you can just change the order of its children if this is somehow not an option because some transform is inherited from a parent you can nullify prior transforms using their inverse in the case of a translation that should move the target back to the origin then you can rotate it in place and apply the original transform again

6083878
tablet	galaxy
for example imagine you have tablet for example galaxy tab in landscape orientation

6083888
trie	tree
the advantage a trie has is that depending upon implementation details the starting prefix letters can be shared a trie is also called a prefix tree after all

6083942
subtraction	addition
or can binary subtraction be implied because it could be made up combinding addition and negation which we have

6083971
int	chars
actually in most compilers chars literals are of type int so your actually storing an int form of a as a pointer to a memory location which can cause all sorts of memory corruption

6083981
post	get
i m developing a rails 3 app on ubuntu 11.04 and i get the following browser dialog box when i try to perform an ajax post request

6083995
joptionpane	jdialog
but joptionpane is a convenience class to create few commonly encountered jdialog s

6083995
joptionpane	jdialog
since the functionality you want is not directly supported by joptionpane s you should consider implementing it directly using jdialog s

6084000
put	get
for example i have a table that i m searching that contains hello but i put a search query in for hello and at the moment i won t get a result but i want to

6084048

6084161
setinterval	settimeout
javascript is sequential except if you use setinterval settimeout or make a request to a server with a callback or using onload

6084171
public	protected
if you need public read access and protected set access then simply use an automatic property

6084182
perl	tcl	lua	scheme
from the question i assume you want an embedded interpreter with which to directly script vim as one can do with perl python ruby tcl scheme and lua - so for example you could write vim functions in python in your .vimrc or so you can write a plugin in ruby

6084182
perl	tcl
look for references to languages in the makefile i see perl python python3 tcl ruby mzscheme lua

6084279
int	double
i presume it works for any size int but is it correct for double

6084280
put	get
i am trying to integrate a rss parser into my irc bot and i ve found some simple code to do so online however if i put this code in the bot i get this

6084305
width	height
so basically the images are sitting vertically-aligned middle and text-aligned center and they have a maximum width of 176 and max height of 158 but they re cropped to maintain the original aspect ratio so the actual top corner of each image falls differently depending on which image it is

6084340
post	put
i want to send json with post put i don t know if it s the same think

6084362
width	height
the div s height and width are unknown

6084368
post	get
i can tamper with the input to change a value if i modify the submitted post get data

6084410
google-chrome	firefox
the order of alerts is as expected in firefox 3 firefox 3.6.17 ie 9 9.0.8112.16421 and google-chrome 11 11.0.696.68

6084424
int	chars
if it finds one it returns the chars position in source of the first chars in str as an int value otherwise it returns 0

6084492
sorting	filtering
the more queries requiring sorting or inequality filtering on multiple properties with multiple values the easier it is to get huge custom indexes

6084501
viewdidload	viewdidappear
on a side note viewdidappear doesn t seem to get called when doing this so it might be necessary to call it manually from viewdidload if you really need to use it but otherwise it works fine

6084516
hide	show
you should show the picture boxes and then set up a timer with code that will hide the picture boxes when the timer s tick event is triggered

6084521
int	chars
and the return type is int not chars or something

6084551
int	chars
not tested but you should be able to cast the byte int to a chars as well

6084555
ubuntu	debian
so the deployment process on a bare-bones ubuntu debian server would be

6084559
fadein	fadeout
so have created a couple of buttons fadein and fadeout to fade an image of a country in and out respectively

6084559
fadein	fadeout
the fadeout button by default is unclickable until fadein has been pressed and when the fadein button is pressed it fades the image in and then sets the visibility to 0 to stop it from disappearing again

6084589
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie8 ie9 firefox google-chrome and works a treat

6084617
int	chars
the simple formats of int and chars can slip through with just endian adjustments but floating point gets more complex

6084618
width	height
if you use css max-width and max-height instance of html width and height it don t lose aspect ratio

6084633
post	get
the general problem with capturing a post and turning it into a get is first that the query string on a get has a browser-dependent limited size and second that a post may be form multi-part what to do with the uploaded file becomes an issue

6084658
children	parent
parent can have multiple children

6084696
many-to-one	one-to-many
unlike normal sockets 0mq sockets can be many-to-one one-to-many

6084701
getter	setter
in fact by adding additional stuff into the getter setter you are actually increasing the risk that you will recreate something that is not an exact copy of the original

6084722
min	max
the command line takes 3 args startvalue min and max

6084722
min	max
the problem is the delta calculation when the buffer hits min or max it seems to be throwing it off by one

6084766
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it does work in ie google-chrome and firefox it surprises me that it doesn t work in opera

6084798
prepare	execute

6084992
google-chrome	firefox
the beauty of this is that the end user downloads the minimum amount of code needed to run the app and won t be bloated by having conditional code for ie when you are running google-chrome or firefox

6084992
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari are very similar and pretty closely written to specs so there s not a lot of special casing for them

6084992
google-chrome	safari

explode	substr
try explode ing on r n rather than just n - i m guessing your data includes carriage returns as well as line feeds which is skewing your substr

6085999
tiff	bmp
tiff and bmp even more so

6086002
put	get
you ll not get it so easily the tftp protocol is relatively easy but put get is not stateless or at least if the file does not fit in a single packet that is something like 512 but some extensions allow a bigger packet

6086031
kerberos	ntlm
getting delegation to work can be a pain in the butt but you have to examine the spn you re using and make sure it s properly registered on the sql server plus mess around with iis to make sure that kerberos is enabled and actually working instead of it silently slipping back to ntlm

6086069

nunit	mstest
both mstest and nunit for example support an inconclusive state but it depends on your test runner as to whether these appear as yellow in the ui

6086372

but in practice you might want to manually search for the max value of width and height if a 15x1000 should be treated as larger than 550x550

6086386
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
tested in opera 11 google-chrome 11 ie8 ie9 ff4 and safari 5 with all dtd s

6086482
cpython	ironpython
cpython had the ability to access .net libraries using the python for .net see maintained at github but aside from ironpython there s never been a way to actually embed a python interpreter into a .net application

6086508
width	height
a different font will affect the width and height of an element with width auto

6086512
google-chrome	firefox
so on most browsers they all float inside on the same level because 366 + 30.5 + 213.5 610px and i am suspecting firefox google-chrome and ie 8 9 actually truncate 30.5 to 30 and 213.5 to 213 so the 2 divs ended up a little bit narrow in the parent div but it isn t a big issue really to be 1 or 2 pixels off

6086512
google-chrome	firefox
but doesn t this affect the result on firefox google-chrome ie 8 and 9 as well

6086590
google-chrome	firefox

unsigned	short
if i have two operands of type unsigned short will they be converted to int not to unsiged int

6087395
width	height
this because the bb ui framework passes max available possible dimentions to layout int width int height so the field should use some part within the passed values
