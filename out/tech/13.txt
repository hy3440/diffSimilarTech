300168
opera	safari
they are not fired in safari opera ie7 etc

300178
free	malloc

300254
kde	gnome
the mockups i d like to do would be mainly for windows xp perhaps also for gnome kde and mac osx but these are not top-priority

300263
equals	gethashcode
you may need to override equals and gethashcode

300264
ninject	spring.net
i think you should really look into the inversion of control ioc dependency injection di design patterns that are implemented in numerous frameworks such as microsoft unity castle windsor structuremap ninject spring.net and so forth

300320
g++	gcc
especially gcc g++

300334

i have an application with my object types that inherited from a base class that contains the majority of properties for the application objects

300629
width	height
i m writing a direct3d application and after noticing strange bugs such as anti-aliasing occurring even when it was turned off and the mouse pointer not lining up to things with the same coordinates as itself i discovered that when creating a window the width and height parameters include the border

300629
width	height
is there a way to tell what the border width and height will be before i create the window

300669
stdout	stderr
how do i launch an app and capture the output via stdout and maybe stderr

300669
stdout	stderr
i am able to launch what i need but i have no idea how to capture the stderr and stdout

300778
serializable	deserialization
there are a whole bunch of xml attributes inm this namespace that you can use to exactly control how serializable and deserialization takes place

300786
for-loop	loops
there was a single data object created then a for-loop where the properties of the object were modified including a new unique guid and it was sent to the service via remoting serializable not marshal-by-ref if that s what you re thinking loops and do it again etc

firefox	safari
so how do firefox safari internet explorer and other non-browser dom implementations handle nodelists

300798
pop-up	dialog
you can pop-up the eject dialog by using something like this

300808
unsigned	short
i need to cast 2 bytes in an unsigned char array to an unsigned short

300811
cpu	affinity
addition to answer your question on how to limit your app to a single cpu you will need to set the process affinity to a single cpu

300827
unsigned	short
you should not cast a unsigned char pointer into an unsigned short pointer for that matter cast from a pointer of smaller data type to a larger data type

300827
unsigned	short
a better approach is to shift the bytes into a real unsigned short object or memcpy to a unsigned short array

300842
multiplying	add
so if you want to add 17.5 you need to multiplying by 1.175

300851
integer	unsigned
i think it may have to do with the integer in php being unsigned 32 bits as in c# they are signed 32 bits by default

300859
mp3	flv
i ve never used it but apparently it will stream drm-encrypted flv or mp3 content and enable you to apply the usual sorts of drm restrictions

300861
floating-point	integer
however these only go so far if you add a large integer to a large integer php will see that the result is too big to fit into a normal integer and will assign it to a floating-point number

300875
multiplying	add
trig functions multiplying by r and add px or py as appropriate

300884
content-disposition	content-type
i doubt that adding the content-type and content-disposition prior to the redirect will have any affect since the browser sees the redirect header and makes a completely new http request to the redirected url which will be an entirely different set of headers

300890
mouse	keyboard
linux kernel uses device interrupt timing mouse keyboard hard drives to generate entropy

300915

firstly two s complement numbers have the property that addition and subtraction is just the same as for unsigned numbers

301285
division	multiplication
there are also two sets of multiplication and division instructions to deal with signed and unsigned integers

301327
switching	screens
then you will switching to the memory screens and modify values in memory that is you will directly access memory while the program continues to run

301424
minimum	max
edit to answer you question why would you want to control the memory allocation or specifically max heap size you usually don t want to but if you re writing an application that is like sql server or iis or some real time application then you d have a pretty good reason to have control over memory and specifically avoid paging otherwise the clr itself and the os already do a pretty good job for you and what is left is to ensure your that application uses minimum resources for things to work well

301426
firefox	safari
the site has a massive js ajax client and works in all browsers ie firefox and safari that uses the same browser engine as cssedit

301428

i need to detect image format to save a image like image1.jpg image2.gif but i only have a stream and i do not know the image format gif jpeg png etc

301500
disk	ram
but if that s the way you like it you d actually be better creating a ram disk maybe 128-256mb and use that for the intermediate files

301500
disk	ram
but i d be happy leaving everything in ram and just committing back to svn every half hour or so or making a copy out to the real disk

301500
disk	ram
the ram disk would be perfect for the temp intermediate and build files

301500
disk	ram
you can always copy the build files off the ram disk once you re happy

301500
disk	ram
the ram disk i use is the microsoft windows 2000 one

301557
hash	salt
my intention is to generate a salt hash of the file contents and append it to the file

301625

if you don t want to inherited all you need to do is provide a properties of type idomainobjectcontainer and the framework will then inject an container into your objects when they are created or retrieved

301757
direct3d	directx
directx direct3d only

301764
stdout	stderr
there are several cpan modules that make this easy and let you keep stdout and stderr separate

is there a way to customize the post build event macros i would like to move the new assembly to a sub folder in the same directory named by the version of the assembly

301812
accessor	properties
one solution to avoid typos is to have a set of accessor which fetch the relevant propertyinfo for a particular properties and unit test them

301838
clang	llvm
not sure if this counts as debugging but for c and objective-c code i find the llvm clang static analyzer to be invaluable

301951

you can then use this opener object to post and get handling redirects and cookies properly

302101
getter	setter
it does not work for properties as you cannot have delegates to property getter or setter methods

302121
put	get
you get this for free from business objects but you will have to put an aggregate measure over each base measure explicitly with report builder

302121
min	max
on specific instances you might also want to expose count min max or averages as well

302128
filesystems	fat
old filesystems like fat allow only files up to 2gb

302129
int	chars
return default t which means you ll return null if t is a reference type or a nullable value type 0 for int 0 for chars etc

302142
hide	show
basically it allows you to show or hide the contents of a cell based on a boolean expression

302144

302222
ant	maven
1 an alternative to ant that you may wish to consider is maven

302232
stdout	stderr
wget prints the headers to stderr not to stdout

302232
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout as follows

302232
stdout	stderr
the 2 1 part says to redirect file descriptor 2 stderr to file descriptor 1 stdout

302258
tiff	bmp
i want to import export the following file types doc xls pdf bmp tiff etc

302305
width	height

google-chrome	firefox
i ve written one that does its job just fine in firefox but makes google-chrome crash and burn as soon as you embed it on a page

302365
accessor	properties
a class has a properties and instance var of type nsmutablearray with synthesized accessor via properties

302368
maven	pom.xml
publishing a jar to a maven repo with pom.xml info to track dependencies is an excellent choice for libraries as well

302368
ant	maven
ant has copious examples of this and maven has the assembly plugins that can help

302444
post	get
i ve seen post regarding parameter sniffing so i created a parameter free version of the report and i still get the same results

i want to create a directory on a windows ntfs partition and then grant a windows nt security group read access to the folder

302530
put	get
it s a very reasonable way to get the initial structure put together but doesn t quite do the right thing with repeated runs for example component guids aren t stable yet...

302540
move	drag
but if you want to start testing mouse move keystrokes or drag and drop you d be better off choosing a more robust ui pattern like the one suggested by brian

302571
ubuntu	debian
or you can set source preferences by package but i don t know how to do it i just know that it exists in debian so it should exists in ubuntu too

302572
rss	feed
i would like to serve a different content from a single url depending on whether the user is a browser or a rss reader hence avoiding an example.com feed url

302572
rss	feed
thus www.example.com posts will return an x html page to a browser and an rss feed to a feed reader

302584
rss	feed
but as there is no sure fire way you better fail on the side of serving html more often than rss or better yet do as everybody else does and provide a different feed for rss

302600
rss	feed
consider a user who uses safari s rss reader assuming it uses the same browser identifier string when downloading an rss feed how would you tell the two modes apart

302608
google-chrome	firefox
i doesn t happen in firefox or google-chrome

302646
rss	feed
most modern browsers are intelligent enough to inspect an xml data source and http headers and determine if it represents a syndication feed typically formatted as atom or rss

302646
rss	feed
while there is actually no offically registered mime type for rss feed the defacto that is used is application rss+xml

302664
inherited	properties
i want to create a properties on my objective-c class which inherited from nsobject that will map well to the completed_at attribute

302718
width	height
i want to add em to the height and width like this

302768
put	get
i know it is executing funcb because i can put a messagbox call in funcb and get the message box

302798
width	height
i can t play with my smarty sites at the moment but i d first remove the from the replacement value to see if the bug is there then remove it from the matcher and just look for height width

302829
firefox	safari
is that it does not work in safari and in firefox it only works if i put an alert

302896
interpolation	splines
to orient an object and make it follow the splines path you need to interpolation the current x y z position from a t that walks along the splines then orient it along the frenet coordinates system or frenet frame for that particular position

302899
getter	setter
whether or not to use synthesized properties is a design decision since properly implemented getter and setter methods will provide identical functionality

302900
width	height
you do know â emâ units in html width height attributes aren t valid right

302922
treemap	treeset
a treeset internally uses a treemap so why not use treemap directly

302946
rsa	aes
there are many good symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms aes rsa etc many of these algorithms let you select how strong a key you want 1024bit 2048bit etc

302960
persistent	transient
i ve been tasked with writing a program to read a pop3 account and differentiate between mail returned as a permanent failure 5.x.x delivery status and a persistent transient failure 4.x.x delivery status doing a retry for the 4.x.x dsns and flagging the email as bad for the 5.x.x dsns

302978
hash	salt
in addition to looking into these libraries you should also consider adding salt to the hash which essentially means adding some extra data to the value being hash prior to the hashing and adds an extra layer of security

303020
integer	unsigned
in order to be able to compile the code you ll need to add typedefs for byte as an unsigned 8-bit integer and dword as an unsigned 32-bit integer along with the header files crc.h sniptype.h

303051
agile	sprint
try using agile when you got a corporate executive on you telling you to plan all the tasks and estimate the hours for 10 sprint at once

303079
spaces	delimiter
you can also change the delimiter so instead of a semi-colon it can use a spaces

303152
sorting	filtering
when such a stored procedure is used as a recordsource for an ms access form and user tries to use built-in sorting filtering functionality of the form ms access tries to execute the stored procedure in fmtonly mode apparently hunting for metadata of the rowset provided by the stored procedure

303198
disk	ram
memory 101 smaller stuff means holding more in ram at once and thus fewer hard disk reads

303200

what is the most effective way of removing deleting a folder directory that is not empty

303243
boost	stl
my language is c++ windows and i have the stl as well as boost available

303255

303267
boost	stl
though they are not part of stl nor boost

303277
mapguide	arcmap
i mostly work with esri software though i ve had a little bit of work with mapguide mostly for clients whose engineering departments are using cad more than arcmap

303278
django	web.py	web.py	pylons
so my question is how does the performance compare between asp.net mvc and the various oss mvc frameworks specifically pylons or web.py or django

303304
hash	md5
for a ridiculously short value ie values 64 characters md5 as a hash becomes ineffective due to rainbow table attacks and as the value you re sending will be shared over the wire all they have to do is brute force the shared secret and they have a known product to work with

303369
cdr	cons
in some cases keywords aren t even english though they may vaguely resemble english words car cdr and cons from lisp

303369
printf	fgets
printf fgets sscanf and many more from c

303371
put	get
as for boost the things that i would like to be able to do is set the node names set attributes in my nodes and get rid of all the extra crap that comes with it as i don t really care about having to put my document back into that class

303381
merb	ruby-on-rails
we have found that as far as maintainability as quickest turn around time to complete our projects are concerned ruby-on-rails or merb offers the best solutions

303388
freemarker	velocity
regarding using jsp as the presentation layer there are other technologies available like velocity freemarker as iberck mentioned above tapestry also has it s own rendering engine

303395
firefox	safari
by the way i ve seen occasional tearing on mac windows firefox ie safari flash 9 and 10 with large fonts colored tabs--i m not sure if this something i m doing something about the larger fonts or the colored tabs themselves--but just a heads-up

303405
put	get
i have put this in a for-loop and using 10000 calls to get the average times of all calls

303446
hide	show
i have some radio buttons inside a container which i show and hide via jquery effect

303480
kate	kde
i recommend kate part of kde as an editor

303480
vim	emacs
it s not imposing like emacs or vim and it is great for all sorts of projects because of the terminal

303540
int	chars
also structs are value types much like int chars etc. and thus are non-nullable

303628
pop-up	dialog
after further research and coming across a number of posts mentioning the unreliability of waitforexit and the process exited event i ve come up with a completely different solution i start the process and don t bother waiting for it just pop-up a modal dialog in which the user can click on update to update the temporary folder file back into the database when they ve edited and saved the temporary file or cancel

303648
mouse	keyboard
make sure you have a keyboard and mouse which are comfortable to you

303648
vim	kate	vim	emacs	emacs	kate
choose an editor vim emacs kate eclipse whatever

303688
public	protected
i would though say that using friend without a good reason sounds kind of a bit strange to me...in c# you have such a thing as assembly so you could use internal constructor instead or private constructor and several static creation methods with different access protected public internal...

303702
hash	md5
finally i just had to comment on your choice of hash algorithm md5 is a great hash algorithm for those still living in the nineties

303811
typedef	struct
i usually avoid these type of typedef i rather write enum in front if an enum and struct in front if a struct i will just use them here because it looks nicer

303835
children	parent
to compound it some objects are deeply nested children of the parent object which the authorization should be performed on

303911
post	get	post	put	put	get
do the tools handle get post put and delete

303946
factories	presenter
i would say to use a factories to create the presenter objects

303986
background-image	background-color
this has the advantage of allowing you to specify additional styles via css that will show if the image doesn t - a background-color or even a background-image

303987
children	parent
is there any way in linq to check to see if a record of a parent exists in its children

304020
ant	maven
additionally maven can also do some ant stuff

304030
hash	md5
finally i just had to comment on your choice of hash algorithm md5 is a great hash algorithm for those still living in the nineties

304069
ant	maven
however some things ant handles better than maven and if there s not a maven plugin for it it may be difficult to handle in maven

304092
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
google gears does fit but its not a standard while html5.0 is safari supports 5.0 and i guess opera and firefox will too by mid 2009 if they don t already

304119
ant	maven
and don t be afraid to go with something other than maven eg ant

304119
ant	maven
the success of your project will be the project itself not its build tool so long as you choose a best-of-breed build tool which both ant and maven are

304143
accessor	properties
sadly and its counterpart are last i checked only recognized by kvo for set as in nsset properties not array properties so you don t get free kvo notifications with them unless you implement them on top of accessor it does recognize

304144
dia	visio
this is a big deal -- not everyone is an expert or even decent at visio or dia and that can be a obstacle to keeping the documents up-to-date

304185
typedef	struct
due to struct tags becoming typedef s

304185
int	chars
due to chars literals being type chars and not int etc

304205
move	drag
click is supposed to edit text while drag drop is supposed to move the tag

304222
hex	binary
binary files aren t easy to read in a hex editor

304280
cpu	processors
it depends on the size of the processors registers and how the jvm chooses to use them - but if the byte array isn t kept totally on processors then you ll see a performance hit compared to a simple or as the array is pulled onto the cpu for each check

304337
post	get
i m also going to be passing it as json but wanted to get straight post working first

304356
put	get
is there a place i can put this file so that php will still be able to read write to it but web browsers won t be able to get to it

our tests rely on firefox google-chrome to test file-uploads so firefox is crucial to our testing strategy

304481
minix	linux
linux was prompted on the original minix

304492
ant	maven
however this is more like ant or nant rather than maven - it is an xml based scripting language designed for software builds rather than using the convention over configuration approach of maven

304492
maven	pom.xml
in some ways you can think of the tfsbuild.proj file a bit like the maven pom.xml file - but they are very different

304565
jsf	seam
is there any documentation about introducing seam to an old hibernate jsf project

305316
free	malloc
malloc and free protect the malloc arena with a lock internally

305316

305803
inherited	properties
this would probably be a good situation to use inherited where you have a parent class possibly abstract define the properties and methods common to all types of records and each child class can override these methods to provide their own parsing and validation if necessary or add their own properties and methods

305804

manually coding sql server-side entity objects client-side value objects and all the cairngorm stuff is obviously a drag but i m not sure what higher-level frameworks to introduce

306209
getter	setter
the controllers calls the setter and the views calls the getter

306222
metaclass	superclass
note that in python 3 the syntax for specifying metaclass changed and the basestring abstract superclass was removed which requires something like the following to be used instead

306252
firefox	safari
whenever i align them correctly in safari usually using vertical-align baseline on the input they re completely off in firefox and ie

306252
firefox	safari
fix it in firefox and safari and ie are inevitably messed up

306279
turing	decidable
the class np can be defined as the class of problems decidable by a nondeterministic turing machine in polynomial time

306279
sat	np-complete
this theorem shows that sat is np-complete by encoding the operation of any nondeterministic turing machine by a boolean formula in such a way that the machine accepts if and only if that formula is satisfiable

306286
implements	extends
for instance anything you can do with a closure you can do with a subclass without repeating business logic--what you end up with looks worse because of layers of braces extra class definitions but is often more reusable you can extends the class you use to implements your callback but you can t extends a closure method you have to rewrite it.

the main problem you re having is synchronizing your client-side state with your server-side state

306593
firefox	safari
both ie 6 and 7 will notice it but safari and firefox will properly ignore it

306593
firefox	safari
setting this and then relatively positioning upwards behaved almost identically in safari firefox and ie with only a pixel or two of discrepancy

306593
firefox	safari	width	height
setting a width and height on the checkbox and then overflow hidden for some reason cuts off the extra space and allows ie s positioning to act very similarly to safari and firefox

306593
width	height
depending on your text sizing you ll no doubt need to adjust the relative positioning width height and so forth to get things looking right

306622
mp3	speex
is is there some sort of library that would allow me to convert a speex file to an mp3 file

306642

use htmlspecialchars in html xml prepared statements or at least addslashes when building sql queries json_encode when inserting values into scripts rawurlencode when appending url components escapeshellargs when constructing shell commands etc

306697
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie but it doesn t work in firefox or google-chrome

306925
stdout	stderr
the real issue was that wxpython by default redirects stdout stderr to a popup window that quickly disappeared after an uncaught exception

306947
width	margin
this example also divides the width into five equal columns with borders and some padding and margin just for fun

306947
width	margin
this is because the sections that divide the width have no padding margin or borders

306947
margin	height
to get the div to fill the height of the window but alas when adding margin padding and borders the rendered height of the div becomes greater than the viewport resulting in a vertical scrollbar

306954
for-loop	loops
you could also do a simple for-loop instead of the while loops over the iterator

306967
cassini	iis
it requires using the visual studio development server cassini during development instead of your local iis see the properties box on the project

307006

xargs	zcat
which costs one invocation of find one invocation of xargs a few invocations of zcat and one invocation of agrep

307232
getter	setter
i am very curious about the possibility of providing immutability for java beans by beans here i mean classes with an empty constructor providing getter and setter for members

307238
getter	setter
from a performance and design perspective using annotations on getter is a better idea than member variables because the getter setter are called using reflection if placed on the field than a method

307246
vsto	add-in
at the same time we ll also be installing a custon add-in built with vsto so we could do the form install as part of that

307272
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i did a simple test with a formula x- x+1 -1 and the largest value of x i can get to work on safari opera and firefox tested on os x is 9e15

versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade from delphi 4 to delphi 2009 primarily because of unicode but also because of the many improvements everywhere in delphi since my versioning

307419
versioning	upgrade
also embarcadero still gives a special upgrade price that borland and then code gear did for all previous versioning owners

307623
rss	feed
i m writing some rss feed in php and stuggling with character-encoding issues

307651
rss	feed
depending on the exact nature of the data you need to insert it may be possible to just use the auto generated rss feed to get the information you want a process will need to read the rss and formulate a query

307699
udp	tcp
the reason for that is because there are many different ways to communicate using sockets tcp udp etc

307748
put	get
how would make a news feed friendly database design so that it wouldn t be extremely expensive to get all of the items query to put in the news feed

307802
serializable	deserialization
use the schema that xsd exe generated itself and that it uses in the serializable deserialization

307861

note when you do this the apache error log will generate this entry when you exceed this limit on a form post or get request

307874
sqldatasource	detailsview
the detailsview is associated with a sqldatasource authors

307884
mouse	keyboard
you would typically start with an nsview subclass to represent your canvas and handle drawing and mouse keyboard events

307899
sorting	filtering
calculated fields on forms can t be used for sorting filtering and can be annoying in how slowly they display in some situations

307899
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
but in general don t put calculations in a recordsource that you re not going to operate on as a grouping filtering sorting grouping

308016
mvp	presenter
however there are variants like mvp where the user is input is received by the view first and then pushed synched with the presenter

308156
config	ini
to allow bigger sizes i have added necessary php ini values in the apache config file to override the actual php ini values

308175
children	parent
i ve positioned my css so that the tooltip appears away from the parent div but regardless the actions should be triggering only on the parent and not any of its children

308175
children	parent
i want my hover out state on my parent element to trigger a function an animation on the children of that parent without the hover out states of the children doing anything

308175
children	parent
it seems that the normal method of onmouseover and onmouseout is triggering even for the children of the parent that the method belongs to which is causing some rather undesirable effects

308202
profiling	debugging
you can also debugging run code coverage use some of the more popular profiling with it etc

308221
dbml	edmx
i just added a ddl generation feature to huagati dbml edmx tools ver 1.47 released today

308238
post	get
so i assume any or most of pathing characters that you cant use on your filesystem will fail on iis request get post

308246
int	chars
as said here switch works with the byte short chars and int primitive data types

308246
int	chars
it also works with enumerated types and a few special classes that wrap certain primitive types chars byte short and int

308261
versioning	upgrade
edit i ve successfully tested an upgrade to sql2008 32-bit i m mostly concerned with any differences in the 64-bit versioning as i don t have a 64 bit server i can test on at the moment i know you can t restore a sql2000 master database to 2008

308383
int	boolean
once a block has been used for a given type int bit-field or boolean bit-field the compiler does not allocate any further bit fields of a different type until the next boundary

308389
int	boolean
if you grouped the boolean and int you would get a very different result

308441
equals	gethashcode
this doesn t override gethashcode or equals because you re not actually using those as it s in a value position

308450
vim	emacs
note i know i should be using emacs or vim but the issue is my theory at least that i m left handed so i use my right side design creativity of the brain more than the left side logic memory so i just simply cannot use emacs or vim my brain simply isn t compatible i tried them many times too even used emacs for a few months but it drove me crazy.

308491
pull	push
is it possible to get mercurial to show progress of long-running push or pull operation

308511
folder	directory
i have a .net 1.1 web application sitting in a folder called c inetpub wwwroot mytestapp where mytestapp is a virtual directory and is configured to be on asp.net version 1.1.4322 in iis 5.1

308511
folder	directory
in the root directory c inetpub wwwroot there is a web.config file for a .net2.0 application because the root folder contains some web pages written in .net2.0

308537
versioning	upgrade
try latest maven versioning usually upgrade to newer versioning solve issues

308581
public	protected
is it better to have all the private members then all the protected ones then all the public ones

308581
public	protected
or should there be multiple private protected and public labels so that the operations can be kept separate from the constructors and so on

308597
public	protected
then comes public data members if any remember encapsulation is a good idea followed by any protected and or private methods and data members

308617
public	protected
i used to do things backwards to this with private then protected then public

308617
public	protected
i never use multiple public protected private sections - too confusing to follow in my opinion

308618
hash	md5
use some kind of one way hash function md5 sha1 ... and keep only password hash

308629
int	chars
you can use switch only for basic datatypes int chars etc.

308632
int	chars
switch needs an integral type like int chars ...

308637
strsplit	substr
you could read a bigger chunk at a time unencode it to a string using encoder.getstring and then split into lines using strsplit r n or even picking out the head of the string using substr 0 string.indexof r n and leaving the rest for processing of the next line

308659
google-chrome	firefox
testing in firefox ie google-chrome on an xp machine

308660
public	protected
i usually define first the interface to be read that is public then protected then private stuff

308677
hash	md5
it is hard to understand the exact scheme you are thinking about but i assume the password is coming in from a request and you want to calculate the md5 hash in a jsp that the request is being sent to

308677
hash	md5
you could even be more secure if it isn t being done with https and use a javascript md5 library to hash the password before submitting it

308720
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
a good solution is to use mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover and mouseout

308720
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
the major difference between mouseenter mouseleave events and mouseover mouseout events is that the former don t bubble

308720
mouseleave	mouseenter
in this example the child paragraph of div#image still receive the mouseenter mouseleave events even if you aren t listening for them but the events won t bubble up to their parent element

308734
accessor	properties
within the public interface it s convenient to group constructors properties accessor and mutators and operators in distinct groups

308749
ord	chr
in many languages there s a pair of functions chr and ord which convert between numbers and character values

308753
public	protected
i find that most of the time public protected private is the most useful to consumers of your class

308847
hide	show
it would be easier to show hide the third dropdown rather than adding it dynamically

308889
public	protected
in addition any methods which a subclass could conceivably want to override which might mean all public methods plus potentially some protected ones used internally must be virtual

308901

ubuntu	debian
you can use the special package checkinstall for all packages which are not even in debian ubuntu yet

308971
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
you can configure to the ability to select multiple values which are rendered as a dropdownlistfor of checkbox

308993
iprincipal	iidentity
generally the user and the security context where the user interacts are different things and therefore if modelled in a generic way these should be separated as the iprincipal and iidentity interfacese do

308993
iprincipal	iidentity
and finally you should also consider whether you want to implelement the iidentity iprincipal with your own user class or just populate a genericprincipal genericidentity instances

308993
iprincipal	iidentity
the most important fact here is that iprincipal and iidentity instances must be serializable as they might go to other appdomains

308995
hide	show
use different views that show or hide specific columns and grant access to those views to different users roles

309101

309261
post	get
pass this parameter via either get or post to your second php script

309263

309277
debian-based	ubuntu
installation was not a problem in ubuntu and any debian-based distro i suppose

309354

the following questions are about xml serializable deserialization and schema validation for a .net library of types which are to be used for data exchange

309647
hide	show
then size your window accordingly and or show and hide scrollbars so they re only show when absolutely necessary

309670
getter	setter
synchronizing your setter and getter here would only have the intended purpose of guaranteeing that multiple threads couldn t read variables between each others increment operations

309674
firefox	safari
it to work in ie 6 7 8 firefox and safari

309703
button	checkbox
radio button and checkbox are still input tags and will be in the inputs var

309703
button	checkbox
the problem is you ll need to add handlers for the checked state to see which radio button and checkbox are selected

309703
button	checkbox
even worse you can have more than one radio button and checkbox with the same name.

309715
hide	show
use css to hide and show inner submenus

in a loop you can read using from the stream into a temporary variable or buffer using fread fgets or fgetc as zarawesome s answer demonstrates then process that buffer or append it to a c++ string

309927
public	protected
for example you might have a bunch of constructors some public some protected some private - wouldn t you want them all grouped together

g++	gcc
but neither gcc nor g++ does even with all the warnings options i could think of -pedantic -wall -wextra

310108
g++	gcc
is there a way to make gcc and g++ warn about this

310108
g++	gcc
edit i just found that gcc -wconversion does the trick but the same option to g++ doesn t and i m really using c++ here so i need a solution for g++ and am now wondering why -wconversion doesn t seem to be it

stdout	stderr
you won t see stdout or stderr

310306
mouse	keyboard
for example by default a program should only receive keyboard or mouse input when it is in focus

komodo	notepad++
i have worked a bit with python programming for google app engine which i started out in notepad++ and then recently shifted over to komodo using two excellent startup tutorials - both of which are conveniently linked from this blog post direct here and here

310346
post	get
use linkbutton.postbackurl to set a different page to post to and some client script to get a new window and the old target restored so that future postbacks work normally

310354
ubuntu	linux
linux is no better at this either i have a default ubuntu install with dual-booting and it takes about a minute

310377
filesystems	xfs
b if you can t move the files around then you might try different filesystems i think xfs might be good for directories with lots of entries

310383
int	double
if you return a double or float from your mbean jconsole seems to round it down to the nearest int

310406
mbunit	nunit
i ve used though i ve stopped and now use nunit mbunit with testdriven.net and vs2005 with great success

310464
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
you then write your own routine to add subtract multiplying and divide your byte arrays

310524
nswindow	nspanel
you should probably be using actual nswindow objects here instead of nspanel objects but since i don t know much about how your application works you ll have to look into that yourself

310529
subclass	abstract-class
a bit unusual but if you had some other subclass of the base class and the subclasses of the abstract-class had enough common stuff to justify the existance of the abstract-class like

310540
int	chars
examples of the tradeoffs i am talking about are storing the zipcode as an int vs a chars field should house number be stored as a separate field or part of address line 1 should suite apartment etc numbers be normalized or just stored as a chunk of text in address line 2 how do you handle zip +4 separate fields or one big field int vs text

310629
std	ostream	ostream	istream
in c++ i could do this by simply making my class methods use std istream and std ostream which could be a file a stringstream the console whatever

310632

peer	p2p
fully p2p protocols such as gnutella or gnutella2 or the simpler overnet made famous by storm worm are based on each client having a start-up list of a few peer

310686
google-chrome	safari
check if the same thing happens in google-chrome if you have access to a windows box to see if it s a webkit issue or safari itself

310699

310744
versioning	upgrade
i only stopped using it when my versioning got old enough that the upgrade cost was significant

310792
decoder	encoder
you could construct a test using an encoder and a decoder to re-encode a few different mp3 files a few times and watch how they change this could help you determine the rate of deterioration and figure out if it is acceptable to you

310823
post	get
first of all you can t trust the browser so any talk about using post rather than get is mostly nerd flim-flam

310866
width	height
the best advice is perhaps to take a cue from the publishing world where this is a common practice for applications that display large amounts of high resolution graphics such as adobe indesign and keep track of exact measurements for controls - the x y coordinate positions and height width

310913
vb.net	vb6
as you may have discovered vb6 does not have a ctype function like vb.net does

310913
vb.net	vb6
however the other conversion functions those that have names beginning with c which you may have encountered in vb.net code such as cint and cstr do exist in vb6 and you can use them to convert to and from non-object types

310913
vb.net	vb6
keep in mind that vb6 unlike vb.net does not support inheritance

311000
firefox	safari
there are some problems with this widget left right arrow keys and home end keys are not working in firefox i am using a mac and none of any keys are working if i load the example page in safari

311080
postgresql	mysql
i recently switched a project from mysql innodb to postgresql and i feel bigger lags when inserting and updating data with ajax

311093
postgresql	mysql
measure transactions per second or even better requests per second with a web server stress tool like the grinder which can be scripted in jython with both mysql backend and postgresql and afterwards see if that makes a difference

311148
cart	oscommerce
i have this in zen cart and probably oscommerce as well in the orders table and wondered why they went that way even more as they have an addresses table

311273
cvs	svn
mercurial seems to have the best gui tools for windows at the moment but cvs or svn gui tools seem to be better i hope this would change in the future

311279
folder	directory
create in your home directory .m2 folder on windows linux and mac and all os es

311307
firefox	safari
is there an alternative to history.go -1 for firefox and safari

311317
folder	directory
i don t know where n x stores yours perhaps in a hidden folder in your root directory

311344
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing can be a new table with all the same columns as the superclass repeated

311344
superclass	subclassing
this works well when you have an abstract superclass or subclassing features that override the superclass

311344
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing can be just the unique columns with a join to the superclass table

311347
width	height
also when defining an image i recommend you also specify the width height in decipoints this should help with the scaling of the image r3a on the page so add this just after your resolution command should be an okay place for it

311448
splist	spsite	spweb	spsite	spweb	splist
you really need to look at the object model available in c# you will need to get an spsite instance for a sitecollection and then iterate over the splist instances that belong to the spsite and the spweb objects

311448
versioning	upgrade
you should never go to the database directly as sharepoint isn t designed for that at all and there is no guarantee actually there s a specific warning that the structure of the database will be the same between versioning and upgrade and additionally when content is spread over several content databases in a farm there is no guarantee that a query that runs on one content database will do what you expect on another content database

311448
spweb	spsite
when you look at the object model for iteration also note that you will need to dispose the spsite and spweb objects that you create

311477
csv	tsv
ps. i looked at the source code of your message it looks like an odd mix of tsv tabs and csv coma

311504
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari pages that are centered move a few pixels when the page is long enough for the scrollbar to appear

311504
firefox	safari
is there a workaround or a way to style the page so it doesn t jump around in firefox and safari

311508
spaces	delimiter
i would use similar formatting as your first example but without the redundant spaces delimiter before and after the parenthesis delimiter

311535
many-to-many	one-to-many
this is more of a one-to-many communication than many-to-many but could potentially be approximated by having the master device act like a network switch

311560
mef	prism
the prism or mef sample apps which include some wpf examples should give you an idea of what is posssible

311574
range	minimum
if your 100 numbers are in a relatively small range you can optimize even further by keeping the minimum and maximum around

311589
submit	submission
however it is generally better to attach the event to the submit event of the form itself as it will trigger even when submission by pressing the enter key from one of the fields

311609
perl	tcl
any of the scripting languages perl python tcl tk etc. have good mature and easy to use email handler libraries in fact you can get this sort of thing for most lanaguages so it should be quite straightforward to write the handler in one of those

311673
serializable	deserialization
this exposes methods for serializable and deserialization so you can fill the private members of complextype in these methods

311685
put	get
take the currently authenticated user s user id and just put it in there instead of passing in another iuser to get the id of

311733
ninject	spring.net
consider using techniques like dependency injection see structuremap spring.net ninject to simplify instantiation if a simple factory doesn t give you the flexibility you need

folder	directory
i am writing a test program to copy some file in application data folder on device to release directory on desktop

311811
postgresql	mysql
admitting firstly that i generally don t like mysql i will say that there has been writing on this topic regarding postgresql

311836
for-loop	loops
loops from the shell prompt for-loop - to do repetitive actions

311847
valgrind	callgrind
hopefully the callgrind or cachegrind tools for valgrind will give you the information you seek

311869
folder	directory
tmp x.sh and tmp x.x are worn bare in the directory folder

311869
comm	grep
my hammers tend to lean towards ls find sort sed vi awk grep and comm

311896
lisp	scheme
i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too

311909
postgresql	mysql
it is a core data-like framework in fact it can import core data models but works with postgresql though not mysql as far as i know

311932
subtract	add
just a sequence of bytes which when run causes the processor to add subtract compare goto read memory write memory that sort of thing

312092
int	double
def _numbergroups num long factor int list double int factor match

312110
integer	unsigned
as far as i can tell it is actually a bug in solaris s libc where they use an 8-bit unsigned integer type to store the fd in the file struct

312166
post	get
this is what i have came up with so far - to get the ids of all post then retrieve the actual items for the first x number of ids

312168
public	protected
so i guess there is one more field visibility other than private protected package protected and public

312219
put	get
if you really think that creating those collections is expensive then instead of creating new ones all the time put the unused ones into a list and reuse them when new keys get added to your hashmap

312231
put	get
don t get me wrong it s not that easy if you want to learn programming you need to put a lot of effort into it but in my own experience rails can bring you some instant results while letting you get deeper and deeper over time

312244
subtract	addition
i m after an addition or fix to get winw and winh to the correct size of the scrollbar for each browser only if those browsers don t subtract the scrollbar from document.body.offsetwidth automatically

312246
postgresql	mysql
i don t know how other db servers do it but i do know that you can use utf-8 in varchar and text fields in at least mysql and postgresql

312283
versioning	upgrade
tapestry has done a lot of non-compatible upgrade with no continuation of support of older versioning

312301
ostream	istream
istream and ostream interfaces to streaming data files sockets etc.

312301
ostream	ostringstream
ostringstream an ostream that saves the content written to it as a string

312308
factors	mean
by grow shrink factors i mean how many elements you add or remove when you grow or shrink

312308
multiplying	add
these are naturally power-of-two values or multiples as you can just add or multiplying by an easy number + 4096 2

312308
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
for the stack you can use a linked list a linked list with buckets an alloc d array using malloc realloc free std vector or other linear structures

312377
post	get
i get a sneaking suspicion from your post that you re having trouble mapping your texture across triangle points to make it show up straight

312377
width	height
e.g. gltexcoord2f specifies the point 0.0-1.0 within the texture in terms of the percentage of width and height of the texture that maps to the next drawn vertex

312377
width	height
with triangle fans you can have some mathematical conniptions to figure out what of width and height of the overall object you are specifying with the vertex

312417
versioning	upgrade
if the os changes and a new versioning of the library is needed to work with it properly you have to provide an upgrade versioning of your binary

312430
versioning	upgrade
if you are only to minor versioning behind there probably isn t much reason to upgrade

312468
opera	safari
not for me it doesn t it returns the same value as ie opera konqueror and safari

312477
try-catch	exception-handling
at exception-handling handling every method body should be at least in a try-catch block at least with a general exception-handling catch at the end

312490
vbscript	jscript
anyone have a script jscript vbscript or similar in the spirit of this handy script but adding the msiuserealadmindetection property

312636
hash	salt
if you need want to store plaintext values in the client side cookie but don t want the user to be able to futz with the values just store a hash of that value in a companion cookie and salt the hash with some value unknown to the user

312636
hash	salt
then you just need to compute the salt hash of the plaintext value received from the client cookie and compare it against the hash value also passed from the client cookie

312642
checkstyle	cpd	checkstyle	jdepend	cpd	jdepend
i have a bunch of reports from quality tools checkstyle jdepend cpd pmd ncss that give me more vision about code redundancy classes usage bugs etc

312668
borderless	panel
if you want to make it look like one control perhaps to make it look like an address label or something you can use borderless textboxes and put the labels and textboxes all within a panel that has a border and a systemcolors.window background

312681
pascal	delphi
you need a bit of understanding in either pascal or delphi but this overview from thinkquest is pretty helpful from a programming stand-point

312777
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
i am using a sqlcommandbuilder object to generate update statements from select statements in a sqldataadapter

312785
getter	setter
the only methods that the class had were getter setter

312795
getter	setter
in fact one would argue that beans and entity beans are essentially that - data containers with getter and setter

312795
getter	setter
i have seen certain sources the book clean code arguing that one should avoid methods with multiple parameters and instead pass them as a single object with getter and setter

312800
getter	setter
note that in this case you probably shouldn t use getter setter just make the data public

312837
innodb	myisam
frequently-updated tables may show performance improvement by moving them to innodb where they can benefit from row-level locking as opposed to myisam s table-level locking

312859
width	height
my problem is specifically accessing the downloaded image height and width attributes in order to pass the correct parameters to the scale method

312863
getter	setter
a passive struct-like java bean all getter and setter may represent a real-world thing

312865
int	chars
from what i ve seen going from int + some block of text to a chars is problematic because converting it to the requisite end data type lpcwstr is more difficult than a straight casting

312894
for-loop	arrays
run that code in for-loop each time assign a different variable place in an arrays perhaps or property of an object to your newly loaded e.target.content so you can access it outside of that oncomplete -type function

312967
mouseover	mouseout
i am trying to fade in a on mouseover and fade out on mouseout

312972
ostream	istream
i would make it so i would have methods in the class like tostream ostream os and fromstream istream then define

312975
mouseover	mouseout
two key differences i use the jquery hover event to associate mouseover and mouseout event handlers such that child elements won t result in confusing behavior and i use the stop function to prevent animations from overlapping and canceling each other out

312983
memcached	apc
i am now using memcached for storing user data and apc only for code

312993
getdate	dateadd
with the following you should be able to use mssql syntax and get the same results as mssql such as select datediff dd getdate dateadd dd 5 getdate from dual

313046
width	height
it then manipulates the width and height of these linked windows and it finally undocks them all from the linked window frame

313054
superclass	subclassing
even if animal was not supposed to be abstract i still have the problem that for some reason since the foreignkey is defined on animal and not one of its subclassing the superclass method is being called instead of the subclassing

313054
superclass	subclassing
while experimenting with this i discovered that when django saves a subclassing model it does two things 1 it creates a row for the subclassing object in the superclass s table and 2 it makes the pk in the subclassing table identical to the pk assigned in the superclass table

313054
superclass	subclassing
cat and dog will have disjoint pk sets and any subclassing of animal will have a pk identical to the record of its superclass but unfortunately django does not perform any work behind the scenes a la i m an animal

313082
cvs	svn
svn and cvs are two very different systems that aim to address the same basic issue - source control

313082
cvs	svn
what i m wondering is would it be conceivable to develop a programming library or api that exposes the same interface but under the hood can be set up to work with either an svn or cvs repository

313082
cvs	svn
the context of this is i m building a web-based service that will involve source control hosting and i want to support both svn and cvs so as to serve the largest amount of developers possible

313112
filesystems	fat
there are a number of open source fat filesystems implementations around

313130
cpu	processors
gpu s specialized cpu s on graphics cards for example may contain hundreds of cores stream processors which operate in parallel to render the pixels on your screen

313175
width	height
you can use width and height on a div

313204
vsto	add-in
now the problem is that access add-in are not supported in vsto afaik

313214
post	get
you should have get and post

313239
rss	feed
although probably not a true mashup i created a script hat would read the apple movie trailer rss feed and then visit the links in the feed to download the html of the pages linked to in the rss feed

313239
rss	feed
so while all the information was coming from apple the script would download multiple things from different parts of their site to piece together a final rss feed that would contain links to .mov files that actually contained the movie trailer

313307
keydown	keyup
also you re code will be more readable if you use the keydown event instead of the keyup event

313322
expression-blend	silverlight
if you are planning to create applications that will take advantage of silverlight s multimedia capabilities you might want to play around with expression-blend first and then study .net

313336
margin	height
as was mentioned if you re trying to reduce the vertical height of an inline element top or bottom margin padding won t do anything

313381
ssl	https
what is ssl and how does it relate to https

313386
ssl	https
https is just http over ssl

313387
ssl	https
https is just http used over ssl

313388
ssl	https
ssl and https are used for encrypted secure network communications

313395
width	height
which leaks into 0 width height issues

313407
cvs	svn
viewvc lets you browse svn and cvs repositories

313410
firefox	safari
it works totally fine in safari firefox mac and pc and ie6 but for some reason it s not working in ie7

313423
ssl	https
https http over ssl

313423
ssl	https
https is where the http protocol is run over ssl rather than directly over tcp and therefore the data exchanged is encrypted

313457
awt	swing
for example swing awt will typically be slower than something written directly for the native os

313458
swt	swing
see for example swt which are the graphical tools built by ibm i think meant to replace swing and give both native performance and look-and-feel

313465
free	malloc
the malloc free approach deals with blocks of memory one at a time whereas the garbage collection approach tends to deal with memory management in large batches yielding more opportunities for optimization at the cost of some loss in predictability

313490
svg	vml
it is cross-browser svg vml canvas silverlight and it looks like it fits the bill

313512
jobs	cron
the scheduler provides a calendar for scheduling the execution of jobs similar to cron or you could develop your own

313523
np-hard	np-complete
note that np-complete problems are also np-hard

313543
awt	swing
is it possible to build the user interface in java using java s swing and awt libraries that operates an application primarily written in c#

313569
ssl	https
relation b w ssl and https https is secure http communication based on ssl protocol http over ssl as they say

313596
strstr	strcpy
strcpy works fine as long as its input string starts at a character boundary for instance the return value of strstr

313598
int	double
besides this method s argument is int while i need double

313631
decoder	encoder
json encoder decoder

313737
mouse	keyboard
or is it possible to know if a click event was fired by the mouse or by the keyboard

313747
getter	setter
we use properties instead of getter and setter for the most part - which fits in well with c# 3 s object initializers

313754
width	height
what is your preferred way of keeping controls centered on its parent when the parent change width or height

313758
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
ok html.actionlink in asp.net asp.net-mvc creates anchor tags a aka links

313758
width	height
another option would be to change the display style to inline-block which would allow you to set an explicit height and width

313848
spaces	delimiter
i have a spaces delimiter list of files names where spaces in the file names are prefixed by

313860
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
if for any reason log4net throws an uncaught exception except for argumentexception and argumentnullexception which may be thrown please send an email to the log4net-user logging.apache.org mailing list

313978
public	protected
first of all you should use public protected or private instead of var

313981
ironruby	ironpython
i welcome the addition of ironpython and ironruby which as i understand it will become first class .net languages with the next release of visual studio

314128
getter	setter
code generators like in java for getter and setter

314137
nant	xmlpoke
longer version no however if you use something like nant to do you build you could use xmlpoke or similar to rewrite parts of the file on build

314159
int	boolean
if you use the datainputstream and dataoutputstream classes you ll be able to read write strings boolean int etc

314176
unsigned	short
a cancer ct picture is stored inside a unsigned short array 1-dimensional

314176
unsigned	short
i have the location information of the cancer region inside the picture but the coordinates x y are in superpixel 128x128 unsigned short

314176
unsigned	short
i already solved this one by converting superpixel coordinates into a offset a can use for the unsigned short array

314325
versioning	upgrade
try to upgrade to the latest versioning

314348
versioning	upgrade
i need to upgrade my current versioning of dnn this week

314382
portrait	landscape
this second view controller simply displays a uiimageview and the user can change the screen orientation on this view controller between portrait landscape modes

314419
inherited	properties
the inherited objects exposed the same properties of the poco it is inheriting from so while inside the persistence ignorance layer i could use attributes to map to the objects

314426
int	boolean
there are string int and boolean properties in my object

314499
int	chars
see the table here . you are just casting from the int value of the chars to the chars value - but that only works for ascii chars not different languages etc

314499
int	chars
this casts the a chars to it s int value and then increments based on this so it s not hardcoded

314517
vb.net	vb6
using vb6 after using vb.net 2008 ide shows the age of vb6 really quick

314546
disk	ram
maybe your machine is running out of ram you are using an network drive or your hard disk is encrypted

314608
disk	ram
by writing to the db you allow the rdbms to decide when disk io should happen - if you have enough ram for instance it may be effectively caching all those inserts in memory writing them to disk when there s a lighter load or on some other scheduling mechanism

314675
stdout	stderr
update joshua s answer is spot-on but i also wanted to save and restore stdout and stderr around the entire script which is done like this

314678
stdout	stderr
append both stdout and stderr to file

314706
addition	multiplication
there is no logical reason to want to perform math addition multiplication on a phone number

314721
filesystems	ntfs
you can make sparse files on ntfs as well as on any real filesystems

314869
put	get
of course you now need to have a main site where people log in that then redirects you to the appropriate site here i ve just put it as site1.com site2.com but you get the idea.

314903
accessor	properties
the papercheque properties accessor are as normal not shown

314905
charindex	substr
you can proceed similarly to get the second one and so on by combining substr and charindex one layer deeper each time

314931
free	malloc
our app does use both malloc free and new delete as appropriate

314931
free	malloc
one of our team wondered if -lmcheck was in fact thread safe and put a mutex around all malloc free calls

315068
int	chars
note for the api of your dll try keeping the data types limited to primitives long int chars etc. to prevent module boundary issues

315110
cpython	ironpython
i decided that i should write as much of the code as possible in python and django and target all the platforms cpython jython and ironpython

315113
stdout	stderr
you are right that you can preserve the original stdout and stderr with the redirections you showed but it is usually simpler for the people who have to maintain the script later to understand what s going on if you scope the redirected code as shown above

315178
gridview	objectdatasource
i m still learning about the gridview control and i have one bound to an objectdatasource

315186
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
it will override equals gethashcode and tostring

315237
getter	setter
so i m using a getter and a setter

315307
getter	setter
so you can use this in the property getter and setter

315382
goto	break
unconditional branches show up in infinite loops function calls function returns break and continue statements the infamous goto statement and many more these lists are far from exhaustive

315668
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
you can wrap for example a fileinputstream in a gzipinputstream and use it in the same way you d use any inputstream

315668
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
note that the gzipinputstream has its own internal buffer so wrapping the fileinputstream in a bufferedinputstream would probably decrease performance.

debian ubuntu are good distros for servers with the right packages installed and centos is great too

317640
folder	directory
additionally one would expect a decent host to provide a directory that is not accessible via the web - ours offer a private and a web folder both accessible via ftp but only the contents of the latter via the web

317690
hash	salt
if you implement your own user list with usernames and passwords you might consider only saving the hash getpasswordhash username givenpassword salt and comparing against the saved hash

317720
ienumerable	ilist
the only way to achieve this is by casting it to ienumerable or ilist and then call the count method

317752
stdout	stderr
your second line using 2 1 redirects stderr to stdout and finally stdout into log.txt

317764

317888
bazaar	git
etckeeper is a collection of tools to let etc be stored in a git mercurial darcs or bazaar repository

317906
hash	md5
you can use an md5 hash to provide a fixed-length virtually unique value computed from the lengthy url data and then use that hash as the primary key

317906
hash	md5
if you log 1 million distinct url s per day for 2 000 years the md5 hash of these url s are still less likely to include a collision than your hard disk is to have an uncorrectable bit error

317950
put	get
to get functionality similar to what i was used to i needed to put in the revision that created the branch-head

317984
hash	salt
i d recommend going with the classic salt hash method

317986
hash	salt
this improves security vastly because now your users don t use 5 letter passwords anymore they use 5+len salt size passwords and if the salt is big enough no rainbow database will ever contain your hash

317990
hash	salt
by computing a hash from a visitor-supplied string plus some salt of course i can tell whether the user provided the same password twice without the security risk of allowing my application to be able to decrypt the provided password possibly maliciously

317990
crypt	md5	crypt	hash	hash	md5
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

317992
hash	salt
i think a salt hash with a proper hash function like sha-256 is the best

318010
hash	salt
also keep with the suggestion of using a salt value whether you hash or encrypt

318021
doc	rtf
this was accomplished by saving the word doc as rtf word s save as html output was much too dirty and converting the rtf to html via a perl script

as far as width and height goes.

318804
ant	maven
what are the pros and cons of the maven ant task and of ivy

i have a table with a binary column which stores files of a number of different possible filetypes pdf bmp jpeg wav mp3 doc mpeg avi etc. but no columns that store either the name or the type of the original file

318882
ant	maven
it would be worth considering if you were planning to migrate to maven and use additional maven features as well but it s a bit much if all you d use it for is to spin off ant

318988
min	max
you may need to add explicit type casts. max and min appear to work across rows rather than columns

319028
fgets	getchar
the examples of dynamically-growing a buffer can be made to work with either getchar or fgets

319053
width	height
the height and width components of the nssize parameter specify the vertical and horizontal padding amount respectively

in google-chrome and firefox this works using position fixed and centering the div in the intuitive way

319094
cassini	iis
apparently iis handles this but cassini doesn t

319127
children	parent
all you need to do is to iterate through all item of the list once and add the current item to its parent s children list

319155

319189
multiplying	add
i would then take the camera s quaternion and multiplying it by the one we generated for the input and in theory that should simply add the input rotation to the current state of the camera s rotation and things would be all fat and happy

319197
onmouseover	onclick
however if i attempt to change the onmouseover to onclick ve picks up onclick and disables the infobox entirely

319245
kerberos	ntlm
one way i found to test in code that you are using kerberos is that that the http_authorization header for ntlm always starts with the following

319264
hide	show
s with some sort of reference to the element and event that should trigger it to show or hide

319265
accessor	properties
normally the properties would just be foo and the object should have an accessor called isfoo or getfoo

319290
hide	show
i then had a check list of request types at the top of the form which show hide the id element when you checked the item show hide function not show

319311
stdout	stderr
if you need to read from both stdout and stderr it gets tricky with a naã ve implementation there is a risk of deadlock due to buffering etc .

319321
width	height
while the width is not limited as other answers show i ve always found it strange that one can drag and resize the height with the mouse but not the width

versioning	upgrade
we recently upgrade our intranet dev server windows server 2003 to the latest and greatest patches including 2k3 sp2 and the latest for each versioning of .net

319415
gif	png
if it has a lot of solid colors and patterns then png or gif are probably your best bet

319433
gif	png
for illustrations that contain large areas of the same color using a lossless compression format like png or gif will be the best approach

319433
gif	png
although not technically correct you can think of png and gif will compress repetitions the same color very well similar to run-length encoding rle

319433
gif	png
paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation

319454
post	get
sometimes plain old post get and process request code will do just fine

319463
post	get
is there a way using the iphone sdk to get the same results as an http post or get methods

319570
prepare	execute
you should be using mysql_real_escape_string or a prepare execute pair instead of mysql_escape_string and it should be where your sql is being assembled not where you are retrieving values off the url

319591
rss	feed
with .net 3.5 there is a syndicationfeed that will load in a rss feed and allow you to run linq on it

319600
salt	md5
generate the md5 s of the first 10 millions of numbers expressed as strings +some salt

319608
put	get
this means that the array will cease to exist when the current scope ends which to put it simply means when you get to the enclosing close-curly so for example return does it

319613
toolbar	docking	qmainwindow	qwidget
a qmainwindow is just a qwidget which provides a menu bar toolbar status bar and docking framework

319613
toolbar	tabs
the window with the tabs would not need to be a qmainwindow unless you want to also want add a toolbar to that window as well

319618
ubuntu	debian
the line of code was removed because of the warning anyway and that s why debian and ubuntu users had to update their ssl keys last may after the line was added back in hopefully with a more strongly-worded comment

i m using asp.net-mvc and the html.actionlink outputs # if i don t use urlencode but if i do it outputs 2523 which is 23 encoded..

319645
post	get
alternatively you could disable viewstate on the page remove any other hidden fields via javascript and also use javascript to modify the form method from post to get

319696
int	boolean
but i don t understand how boolean algebra works with int in c# at the least

319707
int	boolean
the key is that the cpu is doing 32 boolean operations in parallel one for each bit position of the input int assuming 32 bit int of course

319750
width	height
you use the width variable i as the first index but usually the first index should be the slowest changing that is the height

319755
valgrind	callgrind
valgrind callgrind with kcachegrind as a viewer is a good choice as strager said

319796
maven	pom.xml
you don t have to replace your existing build process with maven but you will have to at least maintain a pom.xml with the dependencies for your project

319820
ant	maven
a final note the dichotomy between ant and maven is somewhat false

319826
min	max
thanks to marc gravell for ponting out that the max in random.next min max is exclusive

319847
pow	math.h
now i have to calculate cube of each digit by using pow method of math.h as follows

319884
implements	extends
if it implements an interface or extends an existing class you can access the members defined in the interface or base class

319887
getter	setter
the best way would be to add getter setter methods to your interface and then use those to get your value

319902
hash	md5
you can always use a hashing function md5 or sha1 for your data and then compare the hash

319919
put	get
in fact when and if you choose to get your application symbian signed you may or may not be required to put such a confirmation box during installation

319993
integer	unsigned
in c# this requires the use of an unsigned integer uint because it interprets this to be 4278190080 instead of -16777216

320007
children	parent
in fact it s 1 parent and 6 children currently

320008

trac	bugzilla
it does this by making tasks a first class part of eclipse and integrating rich and offline editing for repositories such as bugzilla trac and jira

320115
trac	bugzilla
if you want to track a todo-list among a couple of developer you really want to use a issue-tracking system such as bugzilla trac or jira

320130
django	web2py	django	turbogears	turbogears	web2py
well php has a builtin deadend and the whole infrastructure is still quite poor but i did not want to go back to perl so i checked python and the python web frameworks like django turbogears pylon and web2py

320130
django	web2py	django	turbogears	turbogears	web2py
just look at the comparison on web2py site - i was wondering why python frameworks like django or turbogears had to introduce such redundance and complicated syntax in their code - web2py shows that it is in fact possible to keep your syntax clean and easy

320140
folder	directory
this creates a .git hidden folder in the current directory

320161
pop-up	dialog
a dialog will pop-up confirming the lock release

320196
padding	overlapping
if in the so example you want to stop it overlapping the padding you d probably have to create another div inside the padding to hold your content

320197
opera	firefox
unfortunately the tag doesn t work in all browsers only firefox and internet explorer and opera with a css trick

320204
put	get
you need to place listeners and update messages but i don t have a clue where to put these how to get access from one panel to the other and maybe if necessary to introduce a datamodel class

browsers and search engines are smart enough to ignore this character when searching text and google-chrome and firefox haven t tested others ignore it when copying text to clipboard

320231
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
fyi there s also css hyphens auto supported by latest ie firefox and safari but currently not google-chrome

320250
min	max
i am using the min and max functions to do this within the select but i m having lots of problems

320262
comparator	comparable
for instance the following sample code finds the biggest number instance in a collection using comparator from the comparable interface

320329
for-loop	loops
also when the for-loop terminates the while loops in your original example will also terminate because there s no change to the empty stack after the for-loop

320389
rss	feed
rss readers poll for changes to feed

320389
rss	feed
sometimes there simply isn t any way to get asynchronous notifications for example to replace rss with a push system the server would have to know about everyone who reads the feed and have a way of contacting them

320393
portrait	landscape
it depends on browser on printer physical max dpi and its driver on paper size as you point out and i might want to print on b5 paper too... on settings landscape or portrait

320406
firefox	safari
as of december 2011 we now have another option with the emerging support of these tags in firefox and safari

320451
getter	setter
now you can use getter and setter to read and write the long identifier

320454
hide	show
when someone clicks on athumbnail change the class on the corresponding div to show the correct image and hide all the others

320498
children	parent
we have so called builders which will build the parent panel out of the children

320499
getter	setter
the compiler seems to generate a class called bindableproperty for each class which contains the getter and setter

320499
getter	setter
in question 3 i asked about binding to static functions but i actually meant static getter and setter functions

320508
rss	feed
i d be really surprised if they weren t available as an rss or atom feed for downloading

320515
put	get
the result is that any arraylist you try to copy into the array would get sliced only the initial part of its representation is put in the array

320531
ready	each
each new request is made as soon as it is ready - there is little to no delay between getting a response and making the next request

320538
jquery	jqmodal
suppose i have a page with a listview and i want to select filters for it perhaps with multiple selection from a list so i make a different aspx and open it using jquery actually jqmodal via ajax the user selects the filters and accepts

320576
multiplying	division
if so then one could simplify a division by making the second argument into its reciprocal and then multiplying

320576
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

320619
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
for other browsers opera safari galeon... the design under firefox will work fine

320620
post	get
that action will have two implementations -- a post and a get

320695
post	get
we ve done this successfully on our project - i ll see if i can get the developer of the tool to post details.

320715
minimum	max
if setminthreads is first set to the minimum number so in my case 2 then we are able to set the max number of threads to a value less than 8

320726
switching	screens
nvu is pretty nice and lets you quickly switching between html source and view screens

we use cvs but looking to migrate to svn

320820
awt	swing
however awt and swing objects allocate some amount of native resources that need to be freed

320834
ironruby	ironpython
there are other .net languages which are amenable to scripting - there are the dynamic languages such as ironruby and ironpython and also boo mostly static but with duck-typing where you want it

320838
lisp	scheme
common lisp and scheme are not purely functional

320854
doc	rtf
you can chain converters as you wish to convert from one format to another to do a conversion docx - rtf - doc

320878
put	get
i don t like these answers where you google for like 5 seconds and then just suggest a solution the real challenge is to put all the pieces together and not have to waste your time with tons of sample-less msdn pages or other coding forums in order to get your answer

320928
ant	maven
is to have a base folder of common files and then another instance folder of additional files and overwrites and our build script in ant maven should be fine too will first copy the base folders and then based upon a parameter supplied select which instance s files to copy across as well

320944
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
its very easy to write multithreaded code in f# haskell erlang ocaml etc because data structures and values in these languages are immutable meaning that you can t modify a variable once it has been assigned

320987
ant	maven
if you use a standard tool such as ant or maven you will be able to take advantage of any number of continuous integration products

320997
slideup	slidedown
i know jquery has slideup and slidedown

321095
vb.net	vb6
i m trying to write a print layout editor in vb6 or vb.net and am looking for some reference articles to help get me started

321139
int	double
however the input object is often a double and the type some variation of int uint long etc.

321151
put	get
in the expansion put parenthesis around the arguments so that if they pass in a expression you will get the intended behavior

321158
gif	png
i m reading all the files in a single directory and i want to filter on jpg jpeg gif and png

321200
opera	firefox
else if e.which netscape firefox opera

321203
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
i am trying to generate some code at runtime using the dynamicmethod class in the reflection.emit namespace but for some reason its throwing a verificationexception

321217
innodb	myisam
innodb_file_per_table makes innodb tables act like myisam tables

321236
cvs	svn
works best with svn but you can also use it with cvs

321287
cruisecontrol	teamcity
ease of setup during setup we found teamcity easier to setup and use especially compared to cruisecontrol

321354
cobertura	emma
code coverage tools such as emma cobertura and clover will instrument your code and record which parts of it gets invoked by running a suite of tests

321410
min	max
response to the max min macros taken from gcc hacks in the linux kernel

321435
int	double
i have only tested it for double floats and int

321441
ant	maven
ant or maven are great little build tools

321479
try-catch	exception-handling
don t waste your time coding low-level exception-handling management use an higher-level api like spring-jdbc or a custom wrapper around connection statement rs objects to hide the messy try-catch ridden code

321506
min	max
you have to test for max min values termination sequences etc

321520
jquery	scriptaculous
but look at mootools scriptaculous jquery and yui animation

321552
redmine	trac
redmine is another good pick - i don t love it quite as well as trac but it s much easier to set up on the shared host where i keep my project management tools

321571
post	get
i d love it if i could get this into jquery - but i m having trouble with the call see my other post below

321585
post	get
i want to avoid doing a double post to get the summary to update any thoughts are helpful

321587
hash	md5
the php md5 function returns a hexadecimal string i.e a476c3... which you are chopping down to the key size while evp_bytestokey is a fairly complicated hash routine that return a raw byte string

321587
hash	md5
it might with the parameters supplied simplify down to a raw md5 hash but i can t really tell

321587
hash	md5
if you change the php to md5 thisismykey true that will give you a raw md5 hash

321619
serializable	deserialization
i m building a distributed c++ application that needs to do lots of serializable and deserialization of simple data structures that s being passed between different processes and computers

321628
innodb	myisam
depending on your usage patterns and schema you can get fragmented pages in innodb and i think in myisam also

321628
innodb	myisam
see the mysql docs on optimize table for some good info on both myisam and innodb

321628
innodb	myisam
i m not as familiar with myisam intricacies but with innodb it is true that statistics can get out of date

321671
jobs	cron
when your database gets too large you can truncate your log tables via cron jobs

321680
children	parent
i m needing to create a function that can go through and find all of the children for the parent could be a few levels and have it replace manual entries like this

321721
uninstall	upgrade
the real trick to this is the installed and not upgradingproductcode condition on the custom action with out that your action will get run on every upgrade since an upgrade is really an uninstall then reinstall

321736
graphics2d	bufferedimage
i m using a bufferedimage with a graphics2d object to draw the image then imageio.write to save the image

321807
getter	setter
the compiler will pick up the bindable metadata tag and will create a getter and setter for each property you marked as bindable

321807
getter	setter
the same as for instance properties basically only now a static getter and setter are created

321814
gridview	rowdatabound
if you use a gridview to create the table you can inject this in the rowdatabound event

321826
post	get
it has the value xmlhttprequest when a get or post request is sent

321863
cpython	ironpython
5 jython ironpython cpython are incompatible

321912
width	height
hard code the height and width on the control - this will override the control s desiredsize with your values

321939
kerberos	ntlm
i have tried forcing iis to use kerberos authentication ntlm authentication and both at the same time

321966
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout stderr and files

322057
icmp	tcp
are you looking at the tcp checksum or the icmp checksum

322057
icmp	tcp
the icmp checksum doesn t include the tcp headers only the icmp type code checksum and data fields

322057
icmp	tcp
a tcp checksum failure doesn t necessarily mean the icmp contents aren t intact it could just mean that the tcp headers were messed with by a broken nat perhaps

322071
getter	setter
we re using nhibernate and traced some issues with lazy loading to properties that were only half overridable - virtual getter but private setter

322083
gdal	grass	gdal	arcgis	gdal	ogr	arcgis	ogr	grass	ogr
the tools i work with most often are arcgis and gdal ogr with some dabbling in qgis and grass

322088
serializable	deserialization
when you make a change that breaks serializable or deserialization this test will fail

322144
maven	pom.xml
i have recently started exploring maven but i feel a bit overwhelmed of all xml configuration in all the pom.xml files

322166
awt	swing	swt	swing
gecko is not written in java nor embedded in awt swing swt at least without using jni

322183
google-chrome	firefox
it was then stated that this advantage only applies to ie because ie interprets javascript which is inefficient when compared to that of other browsers such as google-chrome and firefox which compile javascript to machine code before execution and as such perform as well as silverlight

322183
google-chrome	firefox
do will silverlight and javascript have comparable performance on google-chrome and firefox

322237
udp	tcp
a server can listen on tcp or udp sockets with some restrictions

322237
ftp	telnet
sending 100 bytes can be done using a lot of available protocols echo telnet ftp http to name a few

322241
udp	tcp
udp doesn t provide the safety that tcp does but doesn t require a response but such responses are part of their protocols not yours

322254
mouse	keyboard
update to clarify the question above it s a machine with multiple users but who use it sequentially via the plugged in keyboard mouse

322264
pop-up	dialog
this needs to behave exactly the same way modal dialog behave in the win forms world meaning not just simulating a pop-up but halting code execution and returning to the code when the modal dialog is closed

322277
nlb	iis
we have set up a 2 cluster nlb on windows server 2003 with iis 6

322285
icmp	tcp
the icmp checksum doesn t include the tcp headers only the icmp type code checksum and data fields

322315
profiler	aqtime
i ve been testing out the performance and memory profiler aqtime to see if it s worthwhile spending those big for it for my delphi application

322330
prepare	execute
the scenario in which you would get benefit from a prepare query is when you prepare it and execute it many times during the same php request

322354
mouse	keyboard
i just recently wrote a delphi class to calculate the difference rectangles of two images and was quite suprised by how fast it ran - fast enough to run in a short timer and after mouse keyboard messages for recording screen activity

322368
google-chrome	firefox
at that with resent developments in javascript implemented in google-chrome and in the yet to be fully released firefox 3.1 one may want do do some benchmarking of their own

322397
folder	directory
support for renaming a file or moving it to a new folder directory is terrible and painful if using the visual studio p4 plug-in integration

322446
firefox	safari
my company makes its money off of a great user experience using ie6 7 firefox and safari

322516
postgresql	mysql
if you have many reads over writes you may want to try mysql assuming that the problem is with postgresql but your problem is a write problem

322614
int	chars
one is a single chars typically s or b and the other is an int actually a cross-database foreign key if you like

322630
mouseup	mousedown
i d advise using some method for cross-browser event attachment - setting the mousedown and mouseup properties explicitly was done to simplify the example

322645
hide	show
there are so many options for chart type and then even more on subtype i wouldn t want to have to render them all and then show or hide the right one

322694
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
a lighttpd configuration would be likeso though apache nginx etc

322735
post	get
the httpservlet.service method gets called for all request types and what you are seeing is a head request and then a get or post request

322773
folder	directory
while you may perceive the file system as a hierarchy of folder containing folder it is actually a doubly linked tree 1 with directory being nodes and files being leafs

322797
g++	gcc
according to the article an introduction to gcc - for the gnu compilers gcc and g++ the problem is that gcc in x86_64 assumes fpmath sse while x86 assumes fpmath 387

322797
cos	sin	cos	atan2	atan2	sin
i can force -mfpmath 387 when compiling my own code and all my operations work correctly but whenever i call some library function sin cos atan2 etc. the results are wrong again

322827
onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onmouseup	onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
incidentally ie has a feature useful in your case when other browsers send button only for mouse button events onclick onmousedown and onmouseup ie sends it with onmousemove too

322835
maven	cargo	ant	maven
i would like to call another maven plug-in in particular the cargo maven2 plug-in immediately after the custom ant plug-in successfully completes

322853
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	addition	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
or as others have said if your values are like money in the sense that they re all a multiple of 0.01 or 0.001 or something then multiplying everything by a fixed power of 10 and use int or long addition and subtraction are trivial watch out for multiplication

322875
int	chars
the byte chars int long types are fixed-point numbers which are exact representions of numbers

322885
freemarker	velocity
for advanced features like loops you may want to use apache velocity or freemarker

322896
getter	setter
as we know data members should not directly be accessed but rather with a getter setter

322896
getter	setter
this if you find yourself in a situation that you have added lots of getter and setter you are probably doing something wrong anyway and shouldn t be using an anonymous class

322929
opera	firefox
another problem is that zooming in firefox and opera can easily break this

322929
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
word-wrap break-word - it s now part of css3 working draft but it s not supported by either firefox opera or safari yet

322991
firefox	safari
word-wrap browser support isn t terrible all things considered safari internet explorer and firefox 3.1 alpha build all support it src so we may not be all that far off

322996
inherited	properties
the inherited path is different for menuitem and button there is no shared inherited tag properties

322996
inherited	properties
menuitem inherited from menu which declares a tag properties button inherited from control which also implements a tag properties

323000
lisp	scheme
learning lisp scheme may not give you any increased application space but it will help you get a better sense of functional programming its rules and its exceptions

323054
subclass	abstract-class
in this subclass checkingaccount we implemented the two abstract-class -- nothing too interesting here

323150
int	chars
as a base case a primitive to extract a single 8-bit int could look like this assuming an 8-bit chars on the host machine you could add a layer of custom types to ensure that too if needed

323206
ssl	https
the entire text of an https session is secured by ssl

323206
post	get
in that respect a post and a get would be exactly the same

323208
vbscript	jscript
clearscript - makes v8 vbscript and jscript available to .net apps

323210
post	get
the query string get as the post is sent over ssl

323243
post	get
members post articles that get rated by the community

323249
base	fractions
for an intuitive example of issues between different base consider the fractions 1 3

323311
swt	styledtext
example i wanted to observe the position of the cursor caret in an swt styledtext

323388
udp	tcp
it would probably be another protocol over tcp but i see no reason why you cannot stream over udp

323389
mouse	keyboard
i know how to change the xaml to set the startpoint and endpoint of a lineargradient brush but i don t know how you do it using the ide in expression blend - does anyone know the keyboard mouse actions that you use to do this

323411
mantis	bugzilla
so bugzilla or mantis

323429
trac	bugzilla
i have used both and didn t like them at all i prefer trac thou if you really need to choose between those two i d go for bugzilla

323471
post	get
you may get some benefit from using the technique described in this blog post to hash large string values such as url s for faster lookup

323480
hide	show
looking from the point of the user a typical user will do just fine with a standard menu whereas a more advanced user won t mind more advanced features like keyboard navigation or possibility to hide show the menu or dock it to the other side of the window

323527
debian	linux	vmware	esx
i ve an linux image debian running on vmware esx 3.1

323538
glm	gam
it s very easy to take a number of say csv or excel files and merge them create new columns based on others and then throw that into a glm gam or some other model

323542
redmine	trac	redmine	mantis	redmine	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla	mantis	bugzilla
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis

323542
redmine	trac
the authors of redmine are trying to create a better trac than trac

323559
pull	push
a more actively maintained branch is available at brotherbard gitx - it adds sidebar fetch pull push add remote merge cherry-pick rebase clone clone to

the egit project is implementing eclipse tooling on top of the jgit

323580
put	get
put that same url in firefox 3 and i get the welcome screen of iis7 a big image with iis7 in the middle and welcome in several different languages

323675
doxygen	tex
doxygen has a number of features that javadoc does not offer the class diagrams for the hierarchies and the cooperation context more summary pages optional source-code browsing cross-linked with the documentation additional tag support such as todo on a separate page and it can generate output in tex and pdf format.it also allows a lot of visual customization

323736
vb.net	vb6
it can analyze c++ c c# vb.net java delphi visual basic vb6 or html

323747
put	get
note that i tend not to put the factory method on the concrete exception because they showup on derived classes which can get

323748
pull	push
push and pull changes

323748
pull	push
in an simplified way just do git push and git pull

323764
ubuntu	debian
for example on debian or ubuntu

323764
redhat	fedora
on redhat based distributions such as fedora

323764
ubuntu	debian
for example in debian and ubuntu you need to install the build-essential package via apt

323764
sudo	passwd
it will prompt you to enter your passwd for sudo this is so it can write to the usr local directory which can only be accessed by the root user so sudo is required

323781
int	boolean
i often use a int rather than boolean so that the same flag can be set multiple times in one processing

323809
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari both have a built-in developer console which has an almost identical interface to firebug s console so your code should be portable across those browsers

323824
vbscript	vba
did you mean from a access macro or from vbscript or from vba

323851
subclass	abstract-class
from a highly obscure security perspective you can t get a pre-existing class to implement the methods by creating a subclass of the pre-existing class and the abstract-class

323857
cos	sin
and theres already an index for cos and sin

323874
hide	show
does anyone know how could i show hide sip keyboard programatically or better what could be done to solve the described problem

323874
switching	screens
once the user minimizes the keyboard it should not appear on the screens on dialog switching

323882
cos	sin
put a composite index on cos and sin on each of the tables

323893
mantis	bugzilla
i ve used bugzilla and mantis but i prefer mantis simplicity

323933
hide	show
you can show hide the sip programmatically using the enabled property

323939
post	get
the webservice receives arguments from post or get and retreives xml in a future maybe i ll use json

323946
hide	show
and use javascript to show or hide the contents

323946
hide	show
that will show a hidden div and hide a show div

323963
ws-trust	ws-federation
there are various standards like ws-trust ws-security ws-federation etc

324009
sudoers	visudo
you should make your edits to a temporary file then use visudo -c -f sudoers.temp to confirm that the changes are valid and then copy it over the top of etc sudoers

324012
sudoers	visudo
visudo is supposed to be the human interface for editing etc sudoers

324021
sudoers	visudo
when you are done exit the script and visudo will take care of modifying the actual sudoers file for you

324025
children	parent
in any case the adjacency lists can be built in time o number of nodes by simply adding each node to the children list of its parent

324030
profiling	debugging
writing a leaky application to test debugging a profiling application with

ubuntu	linux
desktop linux users are also likely to be running the 64-bit versions of their favorite distro most likely ubuntu suse or fedora

324080
superclass	subclassing
i m extending the functionality of a class with a subclassing and i m doing some dirty stuff that make superclass methods dangerous app will hang in a loop in the context of the subclassing

324088
post	put
i didnt want to put the sql generated in the first post otherwise it would be too much thing -

324129
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera the solution is very easy they have builtin xpath support

324131
post	get
furthermore i found an interesting post that explains how to create get a name value pair which is pretty much what you are expecting as far as i understood

324137
superclass	subclassing
just re-implement the unsafe method in your subclassing and have it do nothing or throw an exception or re-implement it as safe just as long as the new implementation doesn t call the unsafe superclass method

324166
width	height
what can i put in the middle of the two to change the width of the font so that some text is expanded or compressed horizontally but the height remains the same

324170
client-side	server-side
only option i can think of is to catch server-side exceptions in client-side code

324210
put	get
get rid of the stackpanel and put a grid with one row and 4 column that will do the trick

324217
nswindow	nspanel
you need to use an nspanel instead of an nswindow to get this choice

324287
udp	tcp
rtsp can use udp and tcp

324287
udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp
the advantage of using multicast and udp as well as library support may make rtsp rtp very worthwhile for internal applications

324306
rss	feed
i want to take a description of a rss feed located in the_content and cut it off after 2 full sentences or 200 words and then the next full sentence using preg_split

324315
width	height
i want to link both width and height

324336
spweb	spsite
the object model is also better for performance as long as you dispose your spsite and spweb objects properly

324344
opera	google-chrome
ie opera and google-chrome are all fine with the page

324351
postgresql	mysql
we also store the query results from our database postgresql in memcache and we are using triggers on the tables to invalidate the cache - there are several apis out there pgmemcache i think mysql has something like that too but i don t know for sure

324355
lxml	libxml2
i recommend you to use lxml it s a python binding for the libxml2 library which is really fast

324355
lxml	libxml2
but i prefer libxml2 and lxml for python because it seems to be more actively developed and tested

324362
hash	salt
if your users are able to find the salt you are adding to your hash then they can likely find a public key in your code change it to a public key they generated themselves and calculate the signature on the modified file with their private key

324372
unix	bsd
further they work on unix linux macos x bsd

324420
versioning	upgrade
the trouble is that if it ceases to be profitable for example because the code is so stable that people buy it and continue using it without needing upgrade then the users of that software can be stranded with their nice stable product running on increasingly ancient machines until one day the machines crash or must be upgrade to a new versioning of the operating system so that they can run some other system but because the proprietary software is no longer maintained you have to give up on the application

324472
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr to stdout so any error messages will be printed

324491
octal	binary	octal	decimal
i am working on a calculator that allows you to perform calculations past the decimal point in octal hexadecimal binary and of course decimal

324491
octal	binary	octal	decimal
i am having trouble though finding a way to convert floating point decimal numbers to floating point hexadecimal octal binary and vice versa

324542
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
as a hint convert octal and hex to binary perform the operations convert back to binary

324542
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	decimal	octal	hex
or you can perform decimal operations and perform the conversions to octal hex binary afterward

324567
addition	multiplication
it also handles multiplication by 0 and 1 and addition of 0

324597
multiplying	division
if you multiplying a unsigned binary number by 2 ti is the same as a bit shift left 1 in c a division by 2 is the same as a bit shit right in c

324597
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction is the same as you would do in elementary school

324608
gmail	hotmail
the html version of the email works great in gmail hotmail etc

324689
getter	setter
and 2 the getter and setter of the member variables were easy to make thread-safe because changing or accessing their values was always done through 2 methods in the base class of all objects

324759
nunit	mstest
nunit is probably the best one some people even prefer it to mstest

324769
opera	firefox
that works in firefox 3 and opera 9 at least

324780
pull	push
the former offers nearly everything mercurial offers including rebase push pull graphical history workspace synchronization etc

324811
folder	directory
whenever i need something from that folder eg jquery.js a css reset i just symlink that directory into my working folder and hey presto

324819
disk	ram
at least throw in all the ram the boards will take and throw out old disk

324831
for-loop	loops
if i have a for-loop which is nested within another how can i efficiently come out of both loops inner and outer in the quickest possible way

324867
put	get
so what i think i want to do is have 3 string var s and 1 int and get all those things put into their respective variables

324923
webkit	gecko
i can think of some terminal emulators that can. if anyone has worked inside of webkit or possibly gecko

324928
post	put
actually if you want to put some hair on your chest take what i ve given you above implement it test it and post it back here

324935
innodb	myisam
i ve tried it with the myisam and innodb engine

325193
int	chars
this would work as long as the 0 -string always looks the same and you re not really after the int value 0 only the chars pattern

325273
margin	height
update notes excuse me for not describing the question well i tried css margin padding attribute on div to occupy the whole remining height of a web page successfully but the trick didn t work on iframe

325334
width	height
but width 100 and height 100 works just fine

325336
profiling	instrumentation
you may not be able to use a profiling very well for example if it impacts the behaviour too much in which case instrumentation should be used instead

325419
move	drag
i am a newbie for visual project i have downloaded some of the totorial to testing however i found the object in those project are not able to drag to move or editing anybody know is it have a object lock function in vb if got how can i unlock it

325422
versioning	upgrade
some versioning bumps between eclipse versioning cause a certain amount of upgrade pain for the plugin writers 3.0 to 3.1 was a big jump

325436
configure	libtool
depending on the scope of your project you may want to add configure check for these gnulib recently acquired new macros to tests for warnings flags and libtool can be used to build shared libraries

325469
put	get
for a short project i might put everything in main just to get things up-and-running quickly

325515
post	get
is there any way to get the updated list into my post controller without having to give it 52 parameters with the id s of the textboxes

325515
post	get
edit maybe there is a way i can post the forum to the controller and iterate through the textbox controls and get out id value any idea how

325524
put	get
where do i need to put this external jar file in order not to get a java.lang.noclassdeffounderror when using this class from another project not in eclipse

325573
jar	war	ant	maven
then when you build ant maven manually for distribution ensure the jar file is included with or within your application jar or war or ear or whatever file and that any startup scripts include it on the classpath using the -classpath command line option for java as vonc has written

325585
pop-up	dialog
but here s another approach instead of using the built-in functionality that pop-up a dialog box asking you to download open or cancel the download you can use your own c# code in your application not the html page to directly open the file or maybe do something else

325591
hash	md5
it provides methods for generate random numbers hash with md2 md4 md5 and sha and some kind of encryption decryption

325614
implements	extends
extends stringbuffer to avoid switching back and forth between string and stringbuffer implements append string offset length parseint int indexof string index replace offset stringbuffer offset length .

325615
outputstream	inputstream
filling and emptying the buffer is done with standard java inputstream and outputstream

325649
hash	md5
this matters because some hash algorithms such as md5 are suitable for some purposes but not others

325769
imperative	declarative
however some systems also implement a petri-net or state change based markup system for workflow which might reasonably be described as declarative but they still have an imperative mode of interaction with the underlying system

325784
kde	gnome
my guess is that the desktop kde or gnome is configured to use a font which doesn t contain umlauts kind of strange today but it happens

325787
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
so you basically use nszonefree instead of free when cleaing up malloc d and calloc d memory

325904
getdate	dateadd
you could put the dateadd d datediff d 0 getdate 0 and dateadd d datediff d 0 getdate 1 into variables and use those instead but i don t think that this will improve performance

325956
post	get
here is a good article that show you how to manipulate the get to change it to post via php

325964
min	max
but to implement min and max you have to code using c ternary for terseness

325975
equals	gethashcode
of course for .contains to work as expected you need to override the equals method as well as gethashcode

326070
gridview	rowdatabound
in case if you just want to redirect to another url then simple use hyperlink web control and push it in the desired cell of gridview row at rowdatabound event

326070
gridview	rowdatabound
1 add linkbutton object at rowdatabound event of gridview

326073
post	get
as you ve already discovered there are exactly two ways to transmit data over the http protocol get or post

326073
post	get
obviously both get and post are easily accessible through the use of a tag

326073
post	get
also keep in mind that an http server doesn t intrinsically know whether a request get or post came from a main browser window or an ajax call

326073
post	get
regardless the web server will read the request will decipher if it s a get or post request look for name-value pairs as appropriate and generate a response

326091
post	get
you can of course always do a get to a page which contains server-side or ajax logic which will create a post request get pagewhichcreatesapost.py

326126
lua	scheme
i d advice lua scheme and python

326138
gmail	hotmail
you can import contacts from gmail hotmail outlook and you can designate subgroups that won t be matched with one another bill and lisa never want to get each other s names

326197
public	protected
in classes you can set some functions as private protected or public

326223
inherited	properties
i have an abstract base class and i want to declare a field or a properties that will have a different value in each class that inherited from this parent class

326223
inherited	properties
use an abstract properties and override it on the inherited classes

326223
public	protected
i can declare a public field or a protected field and explicitly override it in the inherited class

326231
public	protected
of course you then still have the option of making the field private and then depending on the need exposing a protected or public property getter

326233
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview populated from an objectdatasource with two items in its datakeynames field

326233
gridview	objectdatasource
can i configure the objectdatasource and gridview objects to have two values for datakeynames but specific which would should be passed to which methods

326274
gridview	objectdatasource
when using the default declarative delete method gridview will pass both values to the objectdatasource

326337
accessor	properties
krosenvald is correct the lock on the objects accessor is released as soon as the properties returns the pointer to the container object.

326374
listview	gridview
i added this column to a gridview along with other columns set the gridview to the view property of a listview and then databound the listview to a collection of custom dataobjects

326379
gmail	hotmail
i m trying to locate and or build an api capable of speaking to hotmail yahoo and gmail in order to retrieve contact lists with the user s consent of course

326394
width	height
coming back to your original question now you can see that width and height are specified simply as styles no special attributes nothing fancy just some intuitive css

326429
cvs	svn
i think central version control cvs or svn is ruled out because our students don t have the administrative privileges needed to make a repository that they can share with one other student

326429
cvs	svn
we are stuck with unix file permissions. also setup on cvs or svn is too hard

326449
cvs	svn
i would say your best bet will be to try to work with your it department to set up a system method for your students to easily create new svn cvs repositories

326480
free	malloc
it is fairly common for heap-based memory managers your basic malloc free to use a single mutex there are fairly good reasons for it a heap memory area is a single coherent data structure

326509
ubuntu	linux
across most platforms windows mac os linux ubuntu in particular

326515
width	height
i believe the problem is that span elements display inline by default - meaning they have no height and width

326529
extjs	qooxdoo
you might also be interested in the unit testing framework that is part of qooxdoo an open source ria framework similar to dojo extjs etc

326582
floating-point	integer
for a strict visual basic approach you can convert the floating-point value to an integer to round to said integer

326602
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter
depending on how much stuff is in there you may get better results using mouseenter and mouseleave to avoid triggering mouseover when you cross element boundaries

326612
for-loop	loops
there is a variation on the same theme that uses a for-loop instead of a while loops to limit the scope of the line variable

326624
int	double
i worry less about how it handles nan +-infinity double int than whether one of colleagues decided to change the argument order and goofed

326631
pull	push
understanding the distinction between push pull vs update commit

326661
factors	matrix
this proved to be a bottleneck in our application and we then used pinning+p invoke to call into a c++ version of the matrix multiplication routine and got a factors of 2 improvement

326668
bazaar	git
some version control systems bazaar hg git make this easier than others but it s possible on most

326700
datamapper	activerecord
as for the orm activerecord or datamapper should be the way to go

326702
superclass	subclassing
if you has a person superclass a employee subclassing it would make no sense for the employee class to have no breathe method

326706
hash	salt
you can attack a secure hash by the use of a rainbow table which you can counteract by applying a salt to the hash before storing it

326707
hash	salt
using a unique random salt for each hash password stored makes it much more difficult for an attacker to use this method

326734
min	max
find the max and min of your data series

326832
rss	feed
but dont just subscribe to alot of rss feed and expect to get better

326849
unix	solaris
when i ve written cross-platform product installers coding a unix shell script for linux mac solaris etc

326920
width	height
however it should be mentioned that the overflow hidden method of clearing floats does not work with ie6 unless you have a specified width or height

326920
width	height
or if you don t want to specify a width or height you can use zoom 1

326953
postgresql	mysql
this is trivial in postgresql and impossible in mysql

326987
post	get
for example if i have a user control that displays the most recent post on several but not all the pages in the site how do i write the controllers so that i get data for that usercontrol and pass it to the user control from only one place in the web site instead of getting and passing data in each of the different controllers that the user control is used in

327004
gmail	hotmail
plaxo has an api widget to import contacts from gmail yahoo aol and hotmail

327016
kde	gnome
i m developing an application to run with either a single-click interface nothing requires a double-click just like the kde interface mode or a double-click interface the default windows interface mode or the regular gnome interface mode

327055
post	get
get and post have two different purposes

327055
post	get
basically you should use get to well get information and post for any actions which alter the state of the server such as adding new records

327094
inherited	properties
paintspecialize will inherited from paint giving this class all of paint s properties and methods

327114
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
nszonefree balances out a call to nszonemalloc just like -release balances a call to -alloc or -copy and cfrelease balances a call to cfretain or or for that matter free balances a call to malloc or calloc

327118
folder	directory
another option is to change the current working directory to the folder containing the dlls with setcurrentdirectory

327132
mouse	keyboard
for example i m currently using an apple keyboard and a logitech mx revolution mouse and i ve been very impressed with both

327133
bazaar	git
bazaar mercurial and git sound appropriate for your case - trivial to create repositories and all the students need to share is read access on the filesystem to each other s repositories

327134
division	modulo
division and a table lookup versus a square root on your machine using this modulo might be faster

327140
sudoers	passwd
set up your etc sudoers file so that managerd can execute the various commands you want it to be able to run as root without a passwd

327152
onclick	onsubmit
do not disable the button in its onclick but save it and do it in form s onsubmit

327182
mouse	keyboard
good battery life two aa s for the mouse and 3 aaa s for the keyboard - at least 6 weeks for a set of nimh s

327206
addition	modulo
it takes a key and does modulo addition to characters to create the encrypted string

327280
postgresql	mysql
postgresql mysql filemaker insert name of database that is not access here excel custom parsers natural language importers perl just because it is a swiss army knife grep awk sed m4 the old versions of access before the demise of access .

327357
multiplying	add
to get a range for the number of crashes just multiplying the upper and lower limits by population size - sample size and add back the number of crashes in the sample

327376
atomic	interlocked
the interlocked class has all the static methods needed to do simple atomic operations like increment decrement compare swap etc

327393
union	distinct
as other users said union is used to select distinct values from two tables

327415
vim	emacs
using windows key as meta is very useful in emacs is there the way to do it in vim

327418
put	get
this article will get you 90 there all you have to do at the end is to put some simple javascript in place to fire the updates every x seconds

327446
kerberos	ntlm
well negotiate can also be kerberos because it is a wrapper over kerberos and ntlm

327464
min	max
the interface is more or less dict-like with the added bonus for you that .keys .items .iterkeys and .iteritems have two min max optional arguments

327476
keydown	keyup
here is the problem i have written an event loop to detect keydown and keyup events

327476
keydown	keyup
the problem i am running into is that a keydown event is generating a keydown and a keyup event when the key is pressed and held down

327476
post	get
i would post the code but i can t get it to look right

327479
dictionary	map
if your chains map 2 words to the probabilities of the third i d use a dictionary mapping k-tuples to the 3rd-word histogram

327484
vim	textmate
then i read a post by jamis buck on how he switched from textmate back to vim and learned some great tricks

327531
min	max
to that i added some min max position checking

327551
floating-point	fractions	decimal	ieee
the most common storage for floating-point values in programming languages - ieee singles and doubles - does not have exact representations for most decimal fractions

327552
for-loop	loops
using the common for-loop form here will allow the optimizer to unroll these loops if it wants

327555
vim	emacs
there are important features of emacs which are missing in vim such as the comint mode and there are no scripts plugins which can replace them

327555
vim	emacs
there are also benefits of vim over emacs such as modal editing and generally better default shortcuts

327555
vim	emacs
unfortunately no mode can make emacs work as fast as vim

327568
agile	greenhopper
update you can use greenhopper plugin to jira which is a little better to support agile projects

327570
children	parent
that is to say one node can have multiple children and multiple parent

327586
profiling	benchmarking
you have to constantly profiling and benchmarking every change you make to ensure you re actually improving performance

327595
metaphone	soundex
commons codec has an implementation of soundex and metaphone

327608
postgresql	mysql
any free database mysql postgresql

327620
opera	safari
in opera 9.62 mozilla 3.0.4 safari 3.2 for windows it helps if you put some text or at least a whitespace within the same line as the input field

327676
bash	tcsh
under terminal preferences profiles keyboard you can check use option key as meta key. many applications including bash and tcsh treat meta-delete as backward delete word.

327694
fadein	hide
if you hide the content before you append it and chain the fadein method to that you should get the effect that you re looking for

327697
dictionary	map
you ll need to use numbers rather than strings to index into the array but that can be solved by using a single dictionary to map words to numbers

327717
post	get
it is a kind of data i would push through post anyway so i m not losing get parameters that would be good for something

327798
many-to-many	many-to-one
edit - the above was assuming a many-to-one relationship between users and rates - where there are many-to-many relationships you need a table for each sort of data and then another table with rows for each user - rate pair

327810
glassfish	geronimo
for example by using the geronimo server which uses tomcat as its container or by taking the jar files from glassfish

327885
implements	extends
after all if this was an interface instead of that abstract class there would be no need to extends a base class in order to create a new actionresult - one would just have to implements iactionresult properly

327923
post	get
you ll have to post that to get a correct answer to your question

327934
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	shellsort	heapsort	shellsort
those are just two algorithms for sorting a list but there are a lot of other interesting techniques each with its own advantages and disadvantages quicksort radix sort selection sort heapsort shellsort and bucket sort

327955
curry	first-class
the main features of functional programming include functions as first-class curry immutable values etc

327972
innodb	myisam
another thing is that i think you use myisam table engine which locks the entire table on update.i suggest you use innodb instead

327995
symfony	kohana	cakephp	kohana
php has many to choose from zend s solar cakephp symfony kohana

327995
profiling	debugging
profiling and debugging tools

327995
profiling	debugging
those two needs are solved by same tool - xdebug which offers improved debugging capabilities and can also generate kcachegrind reports for profiling your application

327995
wordpress	joomla
i ve used wordpress and joomla as blogging platforms html purifier for sanitizing and validating html minify for minifying and concatenating css and javascript among others

327996
post	put
in this sample i m using the default config for a rest singleton service from the wcf rest starter kit with the exception of some changes to the onadditem method to accept updates via a post since silverlight put isn t supported

328041
solaris	aix
the solution needs to run on windows linux solaris aix and hp-ux

328064
dictionary	map
i would expect that the map dictionary hashtable of the non-zero values should be a fast and economical solution

328096
mouseup	mousedown
you need to handle the mousedown and mouseup and set some flag or something to track it later down the road .

328135
put	get
if i put the other control before in the z-order i can not get the mouse message in my control

328146
curry	first-class
first-class curry

328163
rss	feed
additionally its not very scalable if you add comments for rss feed favorite links user status etc then you have intermediate tables for all of those types

328225
superclass	subclassing
in the code above it looks like you re mixing annotations on fields superclass and methods subclassing

328225
getter	setter
in my experience with hibernate it s safer and more flexible to annotate getter setter methods instead of fields anyway so i suggest sticking to that design if you can

328228
int	chars
the value of an int chars

328228
int	chars
for example if int is only 16 bits wide in a particular implementation then jan can t be represented anymore like you intend it chars must be at least 8 bits while a chars literal is always of type int

328236
int	chars
the fact that a four chars constant is equivalent to an particular 32-bit int is a non-standard feature often seen on compilers for ms windows and mac computers and palmos afaicr

328237
int	chars
machine word size issues aside your compiler may promote input i to a negative int which will just set the upper bits of inputint with or operation so i suggest you to be explicit about signedness of chars variables

328354
put	get
jasper includes an imageservlet class that fetches these from the session where the jrhtmlexporter has put them but you have to get the config of both the html exporter and image servlet just right and its hard to tell where you re going wrong

328438
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
i ve always been baffled about the strange coupling in the iphone api -- in particular with the uiviewcontroller which has hard-coded references to a uitabbaritem uitabbarcontroller etc

328438
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so you end up adding a uiviewcontroller to a uitabbarcontroller which in turn queries the uiviewcontroller as to what should be displayed on the uitabbar through the uiviewcontroller s tabbaritem property

328468
width	height
the problem is that i have a set width and height the thumbnails need to be and often times the images are stretched

328473
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the structure.css file would contain rules that only used properties like height width margin padding float position etc

328484
width	height
you ll need to calculate the new width height to keep the image proportionat

328500
width	height
i am able to resize surfaces without any problem by modifying the surfaces width and height but the resulting surface is clipped

328539
perl	tcl
you can embed perl python tcl and ruby

328604
vsts	tfs
so when you re using the full microsoft stack vsts and tfs i d suggest just sticking with msbuild scripts

328797
ienumerable	icollection
icollection n a use ienumerable t or anything that extends it

328797
ienumerable	icollection
this makes the interfaces similar in name only while icollection and ienumerable t differ by very little

328812
identifier	ambiguous
also file could mean i am a file point which is ambiguous filename doesn t state whether or not it has context ie directories fileuri is contextwise unambiguous as it says this is a resource identifier that when observed points to a resource a file

328813
folder	directory
so i would use folder or path to identify the directory that the file is in

328841
valgrind	callgrind
if you are using linux i suggest using callgrind part of valgrind to find out what parts of the execution takes the most time

328909
free	malloc
what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

328936
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
if it is possible i want to get the same id from linux or freebsd or solaris etc.

328936
hash	md5
if there is no other option available i can use mac in combination with something else for example the id can be the md5 hash of the combination of the mac address and something else

328942
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
instead it sends a message to the uitabbarcontroller to switch to the uiviewcontroller as indicated by the selected tab bar item

329009
subtraction	addition
just like in math where you move from addition and subtraction to integration and differentiation these are advanced techniques that will help you solve problems that are out there

329041
translation	localization
this is primarily regarding the ui localization translation part of your app

329045
ienumerable	ienumerator
i m not saying that ienumerable or ienumerator are bad interfaces

329058
ienumerable	ienumerator
why do you think microsoft wants us to go through ienumerable to get to ienumerator

329066
serializable	deserialization
xmlserializer works by generating code to do the serializable deserialization and storing this in a temporary assembly

329066
serializable	deserialization
this approach gives good performance for repeated serializable deserialization but traditionally shockingly awful performance for the first run

329073
ienumerable	ienumerator
it is a matter of seperating responsibilities ienumerable is a class that can be iterated over ienumerator is a class that does the iteration

329094
free	malloc
for example if you had used malloc to allocate memory then you should free and if you had used new to allocate then you should use delete

329120
int	chars
edit all that said you could still implement your own key combinations to allow unicode chars to be entered via the keyboard -- such as type ctrl+alt+u and then four hex digits -- your readkey routine could detect the ctrl+alt+u and then grab the next four keystrokes and make an int out of them and convert it into a chars -- but of course this wouldn t allow for pasting

329131
free	malloc
some performance notes about new delete and malloc free

329131
free	malloc
malloc and free do not call the constructor and deconstructor respectively

329131
realloc	malloc
i suggest staying consistent with new malloc usage unless you have a reason realloc

329131
free	malloc
also you won t mess up by free ing something allocated with new or deleting something allocated with malloc

329174
addition	multiplication
one of the most popular answers i got was 1 flop an addition and a multiplication operation

329183
multiplying	subtract
as an example if you take exactly one second for an operation such as adding subtract multiplying or dividing two values and returning the result your performance is simply 1 flops

329185
addition	multiplication
some cpu s can perform addition and multiplication as one operation others can t for example

329195
g++	gcc
if you are using them you have to as other answers already noted link with g++ instead of gcc which will add -lstdc++ for you

329217
vim	emacs
unfortunately no mode can make emacs work as fast as vim

329223
prepare	execute
using a prepare and execute style means that only one place execute needs to know about escaping if escaping is even necessary

329240
georss	kml
no like you have mentioned html in the description is the only way i know that you can control the style of balloons through kml georss feed

329243
addition	multiplication
since most processors can do an addition comparison or multiplication in a single cycle those are all counted as one flop

329243
addition	multiplication
if a processor has a fused multiply-add instruction that does a multiplication and an addition in a single instruction -- generally a + b c -- that counts as 2 operations

329303
jboss	glassfish
the reference implementation is the one included with the glassfish i believe the one used in jboss is the hibernate implementation so you should be able to find the source code there

329390
superclass	subclassing
any idea how i can make the superclass create an instance of the subclassing

329455

then you only need to define the rules in one place and you don t have to worry about your client-side validation server-side validation and test cases getting out of sync with each other

329481
ubuntu	debian
you would install debian or ubuntu then take a snapshot how-to for vmware and parallels

329487
websphere	ibm
if you plan to develop enterprise-grade java applications the only acceptable choice today is the ibm everyplace websphere micro envinronment previously known as j9 jvm which is not free though the license is pretty inexpensive

in a unix environment you almost certainly have access to the bsd regular expression tools regcomp regerror regexec regfree which are c-like rather than c++-like but do work

329587
getter	setter
the attributes on a property have little or nothing to do with archiving behavior they only describe how getter and setter work

329665

329862
filtering	grouping
a bit of a hacky solution is to use in with a grouping by and having filtering

329883
versioning	upgrade
you can then write scripts to check for updated versioning etc to avoid having to mess around with manual upgrade

329906
datamodel	relational-model
in most cases iâ ve designed my datamodel first in a way that takes the existing data and organizes it into relational-model

329915
ienumerator	idisposable
one item that may trip you up is that ienumerator t additionally implements idisposable so curvepointenumerator and rtratepointenumerator will need to have a dispose method added

329995
crypt	salt
it says that since the length of the salt may vary depending on the underlying crypt implementation you should provide the entire crypted password as the salt value when checking passwords

330000
hash	salt
you could randomly generate n characters of per-user salt to be combined with the user s password in a sha-1 hash

330016
hash	salt
so you should add a little randomized salt to all your password hash and just store it in plaintext next to the hash password value

330022
pull	push
i believe you can continue to pull remote changes into your local repository but have changes you never push back

330035

md5 does not create a unique hash value

330267
hash	md5
opens source code for crypto hash implementations md5 and sha can be found at mozilla code

330280
prepare	execute
calling a prepare statement is a lot safer no sql injection possible and doing so in a loop is more efficient as well because only parameter values are sent to the server on execute instead of whole statements

330358
hash	md5
if hash functions such as md5 were reversible then it would have been a watershed event in the history of data compression algorithms

330374

pop-up	dialog
we have implemented a pop-up window as a modal dialog using the ie method

330646
put	get
i ve used the rexx one a bit as there s no choice but when i ve coded for notes databases i ve preferred the get put way of doing things

330657
post	get
security wise i prefer using post than get as it gives at least some opaqueness as to what is being passed as a parameter and not anyone can just edit the url and play around

330806
invokerequired	begininvoke
what you need to do is check invokerequired and begininvoke before setting the controls on your ui so you don t get the error like so

330860
google-chrome	firefox
depending on the browser there may be separations between tabs ie8 and google-chrome uses separate processes whereas firefox and ie7 do not

330883
bazaar	git
in my examples i will be assuming you use subversion for your version control but it works virtually the same with other version control packages such as git or bazaar

330901
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
i haven t looked at this in a while but if i recall correctly both ant and maven still rely on junit 3 for unit tests as of maven 2.09 the default pom.xml file still has junit 3.81

330918
min	max
does hibernate hql queries support using select min max count and other sql functions

330930
min	max
yes min max and count are supported in hql

richtextbox	linklabel
if that is in windows forms and you really can t use the richtextbox you can create a control with a linklabel inside of textbox

330999
cvs	svn
svn was designed explicitly to be a better cvs

330999
cvs	svn
it makes sense that many of the cvs users would migrate to svn because it fixes nearly all of cvs s faults is easier to use and maintain adds new features and has a really easy migration path

331044
ssl	https
in my case the problem was that https was unable to start correctly because listen 443 was in ifdefine ssl derective but my apache didnt start with -dssl option

331052

i have a canvas element defined statically in the html with a width and height

331052
width	height
if i attempt to use javascript to resize it dynamically setting a new width and height - either on the attributes of the canvas or via the style properties i get the following error in firefox

331074
implements	extends
i m not sure if c# is implements differently than java but it usually has some default size and if you add more than that it extends the set

331111
client-side	server-side
because it s client-side there is no server-side impact

331118
lisp	smalltalk
do you know any preferably opensource lisp smalltalk apps

331159
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
attributes are set by field controls within your window text boxes checkbox and dropdownlistfor rather than menu items toolbar controls or ribbon controls

331233
post	get
for example items 0 may not be the same between the get and the post

331277
post	get
the web way to deal with this situation is to redirect after a post to get a clean version of the page that can be refreshed without reposting an action to the webserver

331283
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	salt	md5
for some added strength you can get the crypt module to use md5 by using a salt in the format

331283
hash	md5
md5 and now even sha1 may be broken but they are still relatively good for password hash and md5 is still the standard for linux local passwords

331300
solaris	aix
i ve had good success with io interface on linux and solaris and i think it even worked on aix but i can t recall for sure

331324

in linux ubuntu i have my panel set to be somewhat transparent and when i add a gif with a transparent background the background of the icon shows up all grey and ugly see image green diamond

331423
dictionary	map
a simple-ish bandage for the problem though might be to map the text representations that you place into the combobox or listview to the original objects using a dictionary field member on your form class

331423
ienumerable	icollection
the official defense is likely to be that they wanted to support the standard ienumerable and icollection interfaces

331462
width	height
it is possible to change the size by assigning width and height attributes using numbers

331462
width	height
as you can see it defines 2 attributes width and height and both of them are unsigned long

331511
getter	setter
one option is to just type the value property as a string write a getter and a setter for it and do the parsing there

331511
getter	setter
the below example is the width property getter and setter from mx.core.uicomponent

331527
stateless	stateful
there is a corollary here to server activated objects in .net remoting one of the technologies that is replaced by wcf which have two modes single call stateless and singleton stateful

331564
put	get
the question is should be how get a full name of type in design time i want to put it in web.config

gridview and datalist are better then the older versions

331652
16-bit	64bit	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
long ago i wrote 64bit multiplication and division routines for a computer the z80 that could manage 16-bit addition and subtraction with no hardware multiplication at all

331695
hash	md5
my first thought was to simply use a cryptographic hash function like md5 or sha1 but this seems like overkill security isn t important - doesn t need to be one-way and i d prefer to find something that would produce a shorter id

331716
google-chrome	safari
the quicktime player opens and plays the file correctly in firefox3 safari and google-chrome

331821
stateless	stateful
postbacks are an abstraction on top of web protocols which emulate stateful behavior over a stateless protocol

331872
mouse	keyboard
the opengl utility toolkit glut provides precisely this - you set up a bunch of event handlers for things like keyboard input mouse input redrawing the display and window resizing call the glutmainloop function and you re good to go

331887
versioning	upgrade
heck many businesses are unwilling to even upgrade to new versioning of their existing database

331890
urllib	httplib
i believe the urllib and urllib2 libraries do not support head requests so you ll have to use the lower-level httplib library

331893
public	protected
your finalize methods should be protected rather than public

331956
division	multiplication
1 multiplication and division come

331956

331992
for-loop	loops
i want to either test during the for-loop or after loops completes for where this empty element is and then replace it with the word other

332023
disk	ram
the only alternative i see is to use the hard disk as the memory ram rom as in the old days i guess that is what you re pointing in your else slower less demanding approach

332023
disk	ram
after getting the problem with the second approach if there are some times when you don t know how much ram is going to be consumed but you do know how much you have left you could use a mixed approach ram when you have enough rom disk when you don t

332025
put	get
another good place to put them is when you click on a picture to get a larger version in an internet store or something

332055

332078
jboss	glassfish
full application servers are jboss from redhat and glassfish from oracle

332079
hash	md5
i m working with some example java code for making md5 hash

332086
public	protected
it also can only go through public inheritance - it will always fail to travel through protected or private inheritance

332090
cvs	svn
svn looked promising but after trying a few projects with it i reverted to cvs

332090
cvs	svn
i wrote a blogpost on this which ends with the sentence the more i think about it svn seems to be a nerdâ s implementation to a theoretical problem whereas cvs is a pragmatic solution to a real life situation.

332093
hash	md5
this what i am using for md5 hash

332103
mouse	keyboard
capturing the screen and controlling the mouse keyboard require hooking into the os in ways that java doesn t do

332125
regasm	gacutil
on my machine i have both the sdk and visual studio running so currently i am utilizing .net sdk tools like gacutil and regasm

332146
versioning	upgrade
try to upgrade to the most current supported versioning of repository and or dotnetnuke

332146
post	get
you might also post over on dotnetnuke.com as i am not sure how many dotnetnuke people really frequent this site i haven t gotten much response in my attempts to get dnn discussions going here

332162
getter	setter
i have tried this in a few projects on the theory that getter and setter clutter up the code with semantically meaningless cruft and that other languages seem to do just fine with convention-based data-hiding or partitioning of responsibilities python

332162
getter	setter
just about any automated tool in the java world relies on the getter setter convention

332165
versioning	upgrade
if you plan on trying to upgrade from 2.1.1 go from it to the most current versioning of 2 then go to 3 then go to 3.3.7 then go to 4.4.1 then to 4.6.2 then to 4.9.0

such libraries exist for haskell standard ml ocaml f# and scheme

332211
postgresql	mysql
for large and complicated systems yes there are enough bugs quirks that can rear their ugly heads - i am convinced that the reason that people tend to always go with mysql over postgresql is that the name mysql is much more attractive

332213
postgresql	mysql
i think mysql get that much popular because it s available on many hosting provider and not postgresql

332230
put	get
for beginning i do not want to put excessive effort but rather would love to able to get some basic results

332254
min	max
i can change the field settings on the time data to return grouped values such as count or max but am struggling to see how this can be setup to show max time - min time for each id hence why i m thinking about heading to sql

332254
min	max
after setting the field settings on the time to max on the first and min on the second a formula can be added just outside the pivot table to calculate the differences

332254
min	max
a follow-on problem was that the formula i add is of the form getpivotdata max of time a 4 id 1 -getpivotdata min of time a 4 id 1 whici doesn t then increment when copying and pasting

332270
postgresql	mysql
you should read this interesting comparison between postgresql and mysql that really expands on the important differences

332284
onmouseover	onclick
is searching for javascript within the href and onclick onmouseover etc

332306
postgresql	mysql
postgresql was long considered the primary competitor to mysql since both are open-source

332311
width	height
this makes the figure s width 5 inches and its height 10 inches

332326
int	chars
performance checks between int varchar and chars

332383
int	chars
if the varchar will be 20 chars and the int is 4 then if you use an int your index will have five times as many nodes per page of index space on disk.

332410
postgresql	mysql
i work for a web based company that uses mysql as it s primary db but close to a year ago we started working with gis data and decided to use postgresql for that information

332410
postgresql	mysql
i learned postgresql grudgingly and have since come to like it but at the same time it has helped me appreciate mysql even more

332424
swt	swing
this is related to swt vs swing performance issues though the differences are no so big as on java 1.4 days

332429
post	get
it turns out as this post details you can use object.prototype.tostring - the low level and generic implementation of tostring - to get the type for all built-in types

332459
postgresql	mysql
i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysql which i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested

332519
strdup	malloc
you are missing error handling for the malloc strdup failing case btw

332602
superclass	subclassing
a in true object-oriented fashion it s possible that the superclass can exist by itself and need not be modeled in any subclassing

332607
getter	setter
i honestly don t know much about reflection but the getter setter should be straight forward

332615
int	chars
of course student_type could just as easily be an int i m just showing it as a chars for illustration purposes

332615
superclass	subclassing
i read your followup about making sure a row exists in some subclassing table for every row in the superclass table

332667
for-loop	loops
while loops instead of a for-loop

332674
postgresql	mysql
another list of reasons why mysql is bad can be found at this excellent comparison versus postgresql

i ve also tried overridding equals and gethashcode to use the id

332703
set	bag
the xml needs to be changed from bag to set for all collections and the entitities themselves were changed to implement icomparable which is a requirement of a set for uniqueness to be established

332731
config	ini
then i load an ini format file with parse_ini_file and use array_merge to map the keys into your class config array

332742
yacc	bison
for many years the de facto tool for generating code to parse a grammar was yacc or its gnu cousin bison

332742
yacc	bison
lately i ve heard there are a couple of new kids on the block but the principle is the same you write a declarative grammar in a format that is more or less in backus-naur form bnf and yacc bison whatever generates some code for you that would be extremely tedious to write by hand

332742
yacc	bison
edit given your followup question about other tools yacc bison of course are best for c c++ projects since they generate c code

332749
yacc	bison
not new code - but were they new they d still use yacc or a close relative bison byacc ...

332823
yacc	bison	yacc	cup	bison	cup
i don t know about yacc bison specifically but i have used antlr cup jlex and javacc

332840
superclass	subclassing
the superclass table has a subclassing code column

332840
superclass	subclassing
each of the subclassing tables has a foreign key constraint as well as one that dictates that the id exist with a subset of the superclass table where code athlete

332840
superclass	subclassing
the only missing part here is that it s possible to model a superclass without a subclassing

332840
superclass	subclassing
that can be fixed by adding a constraint that the superclass s ids exist in a union of the ids in the subclassing tables

332842
bazaar	git
subversion and git did not have issues with this neither did bazaar iirc

knowing this will help my decision re profiler and memory analysis tools for delphi and it also is another answer to my question how does aqtime do it

332960
postgresql	mysql
this is much less prevalent now mysql postgresql sqlite etc

332975
profiler	aqtime
aqtime is an instrumenting profiler

332975
profiling	instrumentation
instrumenting profiling often aren t suitable for measuring code time particularly in microbenchmarks like yours because the cost of the instrumentation often outweighs the cost of the thing being measured

332988
post	get
however when you then add a new mapping get post and try to browse to the file you get a 404

trie	tree
in this case it we used a trie data structure as a dictionary a tree of characters where the leaf node contains the value for the string used as key if the key is bounded then its lookup time can be considered o 1 if i define a character field as having at most k characters in length which can be a reasonable assumption for many cases

333128
innodb	myisam
myisam files are okay to take a copy whilst running but innodb files are not really safe to do that and windows mysql defaults to innodb files

so in essence they are putting two pieces of information in that single unsigned integer - which square was tapped the low bits and were the touches beginning or ending the high bit

333144
inherited	properties
inherited objects cannot have navigation properties - if you have a person class and then a customer and supplier those customer and suppliers cannont have navigation properties

333144
inherited	properties
these are generally not show-stopper items for navigation properties we just don t use inherited on entity framework for now but might be something of interest to yourself

apache activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine

333473
getter	setter
the problem with this solution is that it violates dry - for each class creator i would have to write setter getter in thecreator

333498
put	get
any ideas how i can either get the form to stay put - or can i put a check on launching my application to check if the app is already running and the form hidden and make the form come back to the top

333499
getter	setter
i know getter and setter are now available in the latest release of all major browsers except ie

333556
post	get
furthermore the secondary workaround - involving the aquisition of data through script tags - is only going to support get requests which you might be able to hack with a soap service but not so much with the post request to a restful service you describe

333571
width	height
the application then resizes changes the width and height of the image

333604
width	height
try graphics.drawimage bmp 0 0 width height

333631
webkit	gecko
gecko opera and webkit also support the canvas element which although being a new html element is used via javascript so i m not sure if that fits your criteria

333657
post	get
easy just use the head method instead of get or post

333657
onreadystatechange	onload
production code may need more fine-grained callbacks for different result states success failure timeout and may use different event handlers onload onerror and ontimeout rather than onreadystatechange

333723
opera	safari
lets starts with javascript ecmascript today you have to make one version for mozilla opera safari and another version for ie

333723
opera	firefox
both opera and firefox support some css3

333734
min	max
display table and focus would be nice but the real biggie would be min and max dimensions which just worked

333850
subclass	abstract-class
one of the main issues i have is that there is no ihttpcontext the .net http context is a subclass of an abstract-class which can t be mocked easily

333881
g++	gcc
gcc g++ make gdb ddd valgrind g vim scite .

333984
coalesce	isnull
you could use coalesce or isnull like so

334052
hash	md5
as the number of possible input files is larger than the number of 128-bit outputs it s impossible to uniquely assign an md5 hash to each possible

334052
hash	md5
how to break md5 and other hash functions

334079
stdout	stderr
the method runprocessandreturnoutput runs the process collects the stdout and stderr of the process and returns it to the caller

334099
pascal	delphi
the newer languages either bypass the linker altogether the interpreted and vm languages or use custom linkers turbo pascal i assume delphi too

334135
superclass	subclassing
also some suggestions on how to move the data that is stored in the database for the future abstract superclass into one of the concrete subclassing

334136
bmp	png
with bmp and png as well

334146
hide	show
one solution could be to wrap the inner text in a span and hide the span when you want the background image of the div to show

334172
temp	tmp
enviroment variablies temp and tmp are

334199
multiplying	add
add your 20 - 25 mb to outlook s 30+ ie s 20+ word s 25+ and excel s 25+ multiplying by the number of terminal users and hopefully you can see where they might be coming from

334201
filtering	grouping
for an extremely simple query like this there s not a big difference in readability but for large queries i find that having my join criteria grouping in with listing out the table makes it much easier to see where i might have issues in my join and let s me keep all my filtering in my where clause

334279
nant	xmlpoke
i m trying to get it for nant xmlpoke task without success

334332
scalapack	mpi
they are usually treated as separate nodes and programmed with stuff like mpi and scalapack to distribute the elements of matrices onto multiple nodes

334335
try-catch	exception-handling
if try-catch blocks are catching very generic exception-handling then i would say it is defensive programming in the same way that never driving out of your neighborhood is defensive driving

334335
try-catch	exception-handling
a try-catch imo should be tailored to specific exception-handling

334338
try-catch	exception-handling
putting code into try-catch blocks when you know the types of exception-handling that can be thrown is one thing

334352
putty	winscp
there are plugins that exist that allow you up open winscp or putty from within eclipse

334357
superclass	subclassing
remember these will only have the columns that are unique to the subclassing columns that are shared will remain in the superclass

334357
superclass	subclassing
then select the rows from the superclass table that belong in each subclassing and move the data

334437
onmouseover	onclick
also the contents of the event attributes onclick onmouseover on.

334498
yacc	bison
objective-c grammar for lex yacc flex bison

334519
postgresql	mysql
i ll be synchronizing data about users between ad and a database currently mysql but may turn into sql server or postgresql

334606
opera	safari
safari and opera showed the ugly url

334623
yacc	bison
iirc bnf grammars are just different enough from what yacc bison want as input to be really annoying if you intend to feed these files into a parser generator you may want to look for files in the appropriate format

334626
button	checkbox
in fact if you hold down the mouse click never releasing it after you clicked on the checkbox area the selection remains highlighted until you release the mouse button

334708
post	get
but by having everything done in post don t you get annoyed by the re-send data requests if ever you press back after a form submission

334716
post	get
get parameters are cached by the web browser post is not

334717
ready	each
the selected-key set is the set of keys such that each key s channel was detected to be ready for at least one of the operations identified in the key s interest set during a prior selection operation

334723
implements	extends
so...i had this clever idea that i d create my own repeater control that implements paging and sorting by inheriting from repeater and extends it s capabilities

334756
filesystems	ntfs
on a filesystems which allows it like ntfs then rename the currently running .exe write in its replacement and then chain to the new one

334787
put	get
which will put the variables back into the get array

334793
gridview	repeater
the gridview and repeater controls do this with their row itemcommand events

334829
valgrind	callgrind
extending another answer i use the callgrind option of valgrind

335076
mxmlc	compc
you can also use this file as an argument to compc or mxmlc if you d like

335104
pascal	delphi
it can do a lot of things but it doesn t even try to produce object pascal code as its output and it hasn t been updated since delphi 6

335244
firefox	safari
the following code will successfully set a cookie in firefox 3 ie 7 and safari pc

335263
octal	hex
it doesn t recognize ip addresses with octal or hex formatting but that s acceptable for my application

335274
isapi	httpmodule
i know i m definitely not interested in writing an isapi filter and i m not really running in the asp.net environment so httpmodule is probably useless to me as well

335308
post	get
ok i m going to try the ajax suggestion but i m not sure how the code is formatted with get and post

335333
submit	submission
a true return value will allow the page to continue submission and a false will stop the postback submit

335366
tostring	icomparable
it would need to implement icomparable and have a tostring that displays the desired text

335379
filesystems	ntfs
in sql server 2008 you can apply the filestream attribute to a varbinary column and sql server then stores the data for that column on the local ntfs filesystems

335394
apache	lighttpd
the images on a filesystem are more easily cached by the web server apache mod_mmap or could be served by leaner web server like lighttpd

335404
cvs	svn
we ve also added a special keyword nocheckin we ve added a commit-hook to our source control system very easy to do with at least cvs or svn where it scans all files and refuses to check in the file if it finds the text nocheckin anywhere

335478
unsigned	short
in visual c++ 6.0 wchar_t is normally a typedef for unsigned short whereas in later versions it is a distinct built-in type

335571
hex	binary
it also discusses sending binary as well as hex data to the serial port

335632
width	height
use a rectangle to surround each player and enemy the height and width of the rectangles should correspond to the object you re surrounding imagine it being in a box only big enough to fit it

335632
width	height
otherwise you can get the x and y co-ordinates of the boxes and using the height width of them detect whether they ve intersected yourself

335655
versioning	upgrade
i m not sure how applicable this is to your particular example but i ve personally run into problems where symbols from the stl library i used conflicted with the ones in the third party library when i upgrade to a new versioning

335660
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
take a corner as an anchor point subtract this corner from each point scale it then add it to the point again and multiplying each points x and y by the factor with which the box has gotten bigger

335692
multiplying	add
to get the final coordinate you just multiplying the the now scaled components with their respective vector and add them together

335736
put	get
however i thought to myself the method property etc which will cause an exception will be at the top of the stacktrace do property calls get put on the stacktrace

335758
width	height
you can do collision detection by simply comparying the x and y width and height values of the bounding boxes rectangle for each of the objects that could potentially collide

335758
width	height
i don t have the rectangle class infront of me but its most likely something like x y width and finally height

335758
width	height
the width and height are self explanatory i think

335758
width	height
they ll most likely come out from the right of the players location though so if the x and y were bothe at 0 and your width and height were both at 256 you wouldn t see anything because the character would be at the top left outside of the screen

335770
perforce	accurev
what are the equivalents to this in other modern systems clearcase accurev perforce

335781
ant	maven
we are in the process of converting our main build process from ant to maven

335781
maven	pom.xml
the problem with this method is that the maven install plugin only uses the version in the pom.xml file not the version passed in on the command line

335791
perforce	accurev
accurev perforce

335796
perforce	svn	perforce	accurev	accurev	svn
but from my experience it just can t beat the commercial alternatives especially accurev but also clearcase perforce etc. which will give you much more than what svn is capabale

335807
for-loop	loops
so i decided to make a single for-loop to replace the first two foreach loops and convert the values in one fell swoop the third loops is quasi-necessary although i m sure with some working i could also put it into the single loops

335830
width	height
your player should have x y width and height variables

335833
width	height
i have an object lets call it mobject that has a number of properties say x and y coordinates height and width

335833
width	height
unfortunately the xml elements are named differently -- x and y height and width note the capitalization

335866
addition	multiplication
and the three new points can be found using scalar multiplication and vector addition

335885
uitableview	uipickerview
i am looking for a way to slide a uipickerview and uidatepickerview up over a view uitableview in particular when a particular button press takes place

335885
uitableview	uipickerview
i understand how to get the events for clicks into the uitableview but there doesn t seem to be a good way to have the uipickerview slide up on top of it.

335888
hash	md5
currently i use the md5 algorithm to hash the users password for storage in the database

335897
g++	gcc
under gcc g++ use setenv malloc_check_ 0 to revisit the old ways. resulting under dec unix in the same memory being allocated to two different objects

335911
hash	md5
it s not necessarily that you shouldn t use md5 as much it s that you shouldn t use just md5 as this leaves you vulnerable to rainbow-table attacks a rainbow table is a table of precomputed hash values - if your password is even remotely common or simple the attacker needs merely to look up the hash and he knows your plaintext password.

335913
hash	md5
it would still take some work to crack a hash made with md5 but it s several times easier than guessing the password by brute-force

335975
integer	unsigned
it darn well should be for numbers as small as 64 million and the cube of that fits in a 64bit unsigned integer barely

336043
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
all the filtering sorting grouping and custom layout stuff you re probably used to plus card layouts amd more

336048
int	chars
int or chars

336080
maven	pom.xml
then in the distributionmanagement section of your pom.xml enable unique versions for the snapshotrepository via see maven s pom.xml reference on this

336089
width	height
main_window window width 500px height 350px

336089
width	height
main_window window width 500px height 350px

336089
width	height
bold true align center x 10px y 10px width 300px height 100px

336089
width	height
my_edit editbox placeholder x 10px y 110px width 300px height 100px

336089
width	height
on_click handler module.file.btn_clicked x 10px y 210px width 300px height 100px

336138
versioning	upgrade
are all the additions to c# for versioning 4 dynamic code contracts etc expected to run on the current .net clr or is there a planned .net upgrade as well

336142
free	malloc
allocating on the heap using new delete or malloc free is very slow

336148
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
if this is the case how does one do an inorder preorder and postorder tree-walk on a treemap

336153
treemap	treeset
afaik the treeset treemap classes don t actually expose any of their internals and merely conform to the set map interface

336301
width	height
sometimes to make it play nice with ie you may have to specify a width or a height

336368
postgresql	mysql
i can take my activerecord model and move it from mysql to postgresql to sqlite thank you very much

336506
bluetooth	usb
this enumeration will contain ethernet cards usb networking devices etc and i need to retrieve the bluetooth network interface in particular

336535
google-chrome	firefox
my main browsers firefox and google-chrome are both configured for a 12 pixel font

336535
google-chrome	firefox
when i view the site in ie 7 firefox 3 and google-chrome 0.4 the font displays as expected and matches the font pickers except in ie where it s a little larger

336672
mouse	keyboard
i need a javascript which monitors keyboard and mouse events to track how much time a user spends on the page

336690
int	boolean
it appears that strings int units boolean are passed by value

336704
disk	ram
if there s any chance you can throw 2 or better 4 more gigabyte of ram into your server you would be very better with leaving that disk reading thing to the os if it has enough ram to load files in some disk cache it will and from them any read on them won t even hit the disk

336704
disk	ram
if you have enough ram to let the os do disk caching and you really want the files to get loaded you could always do a little script program that will go through your hierarchy and read all the files

336747
put	get
do you mean to put data in a dll and use loadlibrary and getprocaddres to get a pointer to the data

336750
onmouseover	onclick
theoretically all dom elements can react on events like onclick onmouseover onkeypress etc

336758
disk	ram
that will also keep the directory of all files in ram so you don t have to access the disk to find a file that happens before you can start loading it

336779
hash	md5
as most have already said md5 was designed for variable length data streams to be hash to a fixed length chunk of data so a single hash is shared by many input data streams

336791
ada	pascal
the and or operators in languages like ada visual basic and pascal do not short-circuit

336805
pull	push
basically where requires the interested party to pull data from a source push linq lets you push data through a source and interested parties can subscribe to events corresponding to another element has just gone past and the data has finished

336823
disk	ram
if you are on linux i would give the good old ram disk a try

336823
disk	ram
as you were talking about vfs that also has a ram disk provider but i would still try the native ram disk approach first

336881
jboss	glassfish
has anyone come across any adverse effects pitfulls when using the entitymanager from within a listener on jboss glassfish or any other application server for that matter

336898
versioning	upgrade
it seems to me that after i have upgrade my acrobat reader from versioning 8 to versioning 9 the loadfile method returns true when the file is opened correctly where versioning 8 returned false

336925
firefox	safari
edit it works in safari but not in firefox

336937
voip	sip
i looking for a way to programmatically start a voip call using the sip stack on a s60 symbian mobile phone

336939
width	height
i would suggest giving the div fixed width and height -- either always or when one of the classes that displays an image is used

336939
width	height
use the width and height of your background image if you want the whole thing displayed

337083
squeak	visualworks
the server is connected to the scm of choice like monticello for squeak smalltalk or store for visualworks

337139
opera	safari
edit works fine on opera 9.50 and safari 3.1

337183
post	get
i d like to output html controls using xslt but i need to be able to name the controls so that i can get at them when the form post back

337241
getter	setter
after all there are mainly just generated getter setter

337252
getter	setter
which would create a readonly backing variable a property with only a getter and translate all calls to the setter into direct access to the variable

337253
accessor	properties
when auto-implementing the properties you have to have a set accessor to at least give it a value during construction

337257
getter	setter
so the conclusion is you should not test getter and setter without code those which just assign or read a field without any additional code

337257
getter	setter
the exception is when you manually write those getter setter because you could have made a typo

337257
getter	setter
but even then some code will use these and there should be a test for that code which in turn tests whether the getter setter behave correctly

337362
ienumerable	iqueryable
while still on the server however i would recommend that you leave it as it s default which is not ienumerable but rather iqueryable

337408
javassist	cglib
i don t think you can make hibernate or any external framework call a private constructor on your objects unless it s through some javassist or cglib runtime created subclass

337410
comparator	comparable
apart from the sortedmap you could have a where you supply the comparator to sort the pairs or make your pair class implement comparable and do it there

337411
put	get
well i didn t get a response and figured out how to modify my command so that it put the name in all the fields in the column so i can pull it now via command.personname

337503
int	chars
a short chars x or int or other relatively small numeric type column that can serve as a row identifier column

337519
wordpress	joomla
i moved an ex-site based on joomla to wordpress

337519
post	put
because there is only 50 or so articles i thought will be a good idea to put a rule for each post in .htaccess

337578
ready	each
once your data is ready you can invalidate the control - this will call retrievevirtualitem again for each of the visible items

337636
put	get
if you don t specify override keyword you will get method that hides base type and warning from compiler to put new keyword for the method to explicitly state so

337731
verilog	vhdl
it covers both vhdl and verilog

337750
int	double
in other words how would a function taking int returning a pointer to a function taking bool returning a pointer to a function taking double and returning void would look like

337756
opends	apacheds
so far i ve briefly looked at apacheds and opends which seem to be embeddable

337764
int	chars
for lookup tables with a low volume of rows you can use a 3 chars code as the primary key as this takes less room than an int but the performance difference is negligible

337820
hide	show
disable this enable that hide this show that

337860
post	get
i just read you last post theres one thing i don t get you are quering the table while you insert data

337990
stdout	stderr
deamon programs close stdin stdout stderr purposedly and use logging instead so that you have to manage this yourself i would suggest to use subprocess.pipe

338006
folder	directory
- should then be added using a virtual directory pointing to their folder

338035
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
for instance if you are using the wcf service to perform mathematics on 2 values you might have 4 members on the service side add x y subtract x y multiplying x y divide x y

338035
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
example peformcalculation obj where obj has x y and action add subtract multiplying divide properties

338037
ubuntu	linux
i tried this in the terminal of both mac os x 10.5 and linux ubuntu gutsy gibbon and it s the same result

338092
wordpress	joomla
since the conversion of your site over to wordpress is relatively new is there anything preventing you from using the old joomla

338153
button	checkbox
if you go on to the validation website and download the whole package that included the demo files you can find the one with example of validating checkbox and radio button

338183
postgresql	mysql
if you can use a wee bit of vendor-specific sql features you can use microsoft sybase top n or mysql postgresql limit

338190
vb.net	vb6
this feature exists because vb.net emulates the vb6 method of being able to refer to a default instance of a form through it s name

338199
httphandler	httpmodule
i don t know for sure - but i d bet that code is buried in one of the sharepoint httpmodule or httphandler that run for every request

338213
postgresql	mysql
but if you re not locked into oracle go with postgresql or mysql

338217
wxpython	textctrl
i have a textctrl in my wxpython program and i d like to set its width to exactly 3 characters

338275
multiplying	add
if you still want to try this the key is to get the width of a character in pixels multiplying it by the number of characters then add some padding for the borders around the characters

338290
stdout	stdio
your problem is that printf and anything else that uses the stdio library to write to stdout standard output is buffered - line buffered if it goes to the console and size buffered if it goes to a file

338290
stdout	fflush
if you do a fflush stdout

338290
stdout	stderr
i m not 100 sure but i think stderr isn t buffered which can cause confusion because you might see output you made to stderr before output you previously made to stdout

338327
post	get
wonderful day i get to post about wicket again

338350
post	get
if you re doing anything else file your solution under ugly hack and use get and or post like you should

338365
switching	screens
i am thinking of writing some code to switching the active display back to the laptop screens when the computer resumes from hibernate

338383
vb.net	vb6
this feature exists because vb.net emulates the vb6 method of being able to refer to a default instance of a form through it s name

338397
hide	show
bcb tends to hide a lot of detailed error info when compiling from the ide - using the command line compiler tends to show the real error

338417
win64	windows
i have just installed the platform sdk for windows server 2008 and .net 3.5 on my new system and for the first time tried to compile a project for win64

338435
integer	unsigned
int or unsigned long int for integer

338476
int	boolean
however objects that belong to the primitive data types which includes boolean number int uint and string have special operators that make them behave as if they were passed by value

338484
dokuwiki	pmwiki
i like dokuwiki but pmwiki might be better for you

338502
onclick	onchange
what is probably happening in your javascript is that the onclick event is called by the javascript engine before the onchange event is called

338523
versioning	upgrade
the best things that i like about the upgrade versioning of vs are

338537
config	ini
i am using zend_config_ini config adapter i prefer ini for base config

338624
chunked	transfer-encoding
i am making an http connection to an iis web server and sending a post request with the data encoded using transfer-encoding chunked

338624
chunked	transfer-encoding
when i try the same thing against apache i get a 411 length required status and a message saying chunked transfer-encoding forbidden

338671
int	double	int	chars	int	boolean
the jsp expression language operator or its alias eq performs comparison with the equals method although some coercions are performed if one of the objects is a special type bigdecimal biginteger double float long int short byte chars boolean or string

338694
cpu	processors
even one when a single thread running that thread is yielding cpu time with other threads of other applications assuming a single processors machine to keep the discussion simple

338694
min	max
while setting max for 1 and min for 2 3 it could be like this

338703
post	get
i can tag on-line web links blog post questions on stackoverflow.com and all kinds of web-centric miscellany but this very basic concept still seems to be missing or hideously crippled in the few operating systems i get to use

338762
phong	shading
i am trying to add the fresnel effect to the outer edges of an object combining that effect with phong shading and i think that the angle is the only thing i am missing

338772
int	chars
in java simple data types such as int and chars operate just as in c.

338795
ssl	https
it turns out that the https site was created using a physical copy of the actual site under the ssl port this means there were 2 versions of the site being served under the same domain name one under port 80 and one under port 443

338815
preorder	postorder
however the other posters are right java doesn t expose any of the tree mechanics so a preorder or postorder isn t possible at this view

338821
wordpress	joomla
wordpress isn t as good as joomla when it comes to user management though

338821
wordpress	joomla
opensourcecms contains demos for both joomla and wordpress

338821
wordpress	joomla
in my past web development experience i ve used both joomla and wordpress for my clients

338821
wordpress	joomla
joomla typically requires having a sit-down with the client to go over the basic features of how to use the software while wordpress is easy enough for the client to figure out without any assistance

338821
wordpress	joomla
however the wordpress sites i ve worked with that require more than the standard blogging features e-commerce image galleries forums usually involve integrating wordpress with a separate software application while joomla more often than not has those plugins available for it

338821
wordpress	phpbb
the end result is a website with several applications on it installed wordpress coppermine phpbb each with separate logins and admin screens

338861
sorting	filtering
for example what if controller a calls a method in the business layer to fetch a list of object a and this method applies the business rules - maybe some filtering or sorting but then controller b comes along needs the same piece of data but forgets about the business layer and calls the data layer directly

put	get	filesystems	fat
if you have hundreds of thousands of files to store on a filesystems and you put them all in a single directory you ll get to a point where the directory inode will grow so fat that it will takes minutes to add remove a file from that directory and you might even get to the point where the inode won t fit in memory and you won t be able to add remove or even touch the directory

i seem to agree with him as most new programmers who start with asp.net do not understand web get post and state management

339682
post	get
with mvc you learn both about web get post and state management while at the same time getting the advantage of using your favorite oo language

339715
post	get
the best you ll be able to do is get javascript to read and edit the xml then post that data to a server-side script to write to file

339726
versioning	upgrade
has the server been upgrade to svn versioning 1.5.x

339734
vsts	tfs
if that is the case and you are using vsts 2008 and tfs 2008 then using the get latest version on checkout setting of both is probably your answer if you aren t then the checkout and get latest version is what you investigate

339734
vsts	tfs
note if you are using vsts 2008 and tfs 2005 you ll need to do the compile yourself see the notes at the bottom of the home page

subclass	abstract-class
one way is to write an abstract test case that corresponds to your abstract-class then write concrete test cases that subclass your abstract test case

339810
subclass	abstract-class
do this for each concrete subclass of your original abstract-class your test case hierarchy mirrors your class hierarchy

339956
mouse	keyboard
user can use keyboard or mouse

339967
getter	setter
agree with moritzstefaner that you don t need the subtraction stage however for your setter i actually think you should use globaltolocal and use localtoglobal for your getter

339988
folder	directory
add the base folder to the project project properties - configuration properties - c c++ - additional include directory additional include directory

339996
children	parent
in a nutshell you attach your event handler to a parent object instead of the children

freemarker	velocity
if it helps at all - something like java s freemarker or velocity libraries

340107
min	max
in addition to not using decimal as has already been suggested you could santise your max min values somewhere else so that you didn t need all those abs calls all over the place

340107
multiplying	add
i suspect that only part of this you need to do repeatedly is a floating point multiplying followed or proceeded by a floating point add

340109
min	max
for example are you using the same min and max repeatedly

340131
hide	show
i would not reccomend using style to hide something it will show up in browsers without or with disabled css suppor and look strange

340141
min	max
ok it assumes that intervaltop intervalbottom and min max

340141
min	max
if intervaltop intervalbottom min and max are constant for a set of values then you can precompute intervalbottom - intervaltop and max - min and use those results for all calls to the function

340158
pop-up	dialog
would it be a pop-up dialog that shows history data

340185
gdal	ogr

gmail	hotmail
i should have mentioned that this is for an internal application and i expect 99 of users to be using outlook or other client but never hotmail or gmail etc

another possible solution i can think of is using shared-memory share the parent s list of children and let the children .add and .remove themselves

340297
put	get
if i try to put any string with more than 60 characters into the field i get an exception

340383
inherited	properties
is there some way for d to be a function and yet still inherited properties from a

so you simply multiplying count by average to get the sum add your new value and divide by count+1 then increase count

340400
linefeed	delimiter
if i could tell excel to use a row delimiter other than cr or linefeed well i d be a happy camper but excel seems to allow the change of the field delimiter only not the row delimiter

340449
linefeed	delimiter
if you absolutely must script this excel actually uses only one of those two chars cr linefeed as the row delimiter but i m not sure which

340533
getter	setter
the compiler needs to know if you want it to generate a getter and or a setter or perhaps are declaring a field

340537
accessor	properties
if the properties didn t have accessor how would the compiler separate it from a field

340577
getter	setter
or by getter and setter

340649
versioning	upgrade
this has the advantage that when you deploy a new versioning of your application it will automatically upgrade old databases and you never have to worry about the database being out of sync with the software

340658
width	height
height --- used the relative distance between the 2 gradient points here y axis but got incorrect results --- also tried using the distance between the 2 gradient points here but i didn t know what to fill into width

340759
awt	swing
using the font is lots easier in swing unlike in awt

340782

however if for some reason you really desire to get explicit casing you can enclose the identifier in double-quotes which are quite different in oracle sql from the single-quotes used to enclose string data

340805
superclass	subclassing
the type of a single superclass instance can be derived by the presence or absence of foreign keys in the various subclassing tables

340811
int	double
using native types like int double etc

340811
int	double
and void-pointers for a container is nearly always an icky affair because you have either the choice to cast the int for a double this doesn t work to a pointer or you need to allocate extra memory for the data type

340811
int	double
i never needed a hash-table or a map for int or double

340820
des	aes
i know with 3-des you can specify a padding type as part of the algorithm and it s handled with no extra work des cbc pkcs5padding but is there a way to specify this with aes

341026
mouse	keyboard
if constantly jump between mouse and keyboard you lose this advantage

341049
put	get
believe it or not the validity of a rabbinic divorce document get depends on it being perfectly accurate which means that over the past few hundred years rabbis have standardized which sounds get mapped to which letters but it s often influenced by yiddish and has extra letters put in alephs mostly which modern israelis would find puzzling

341130
vim	emacs
i work in a unix environment with the typical unix tools emacs vim gvim sunstudio etc

i have been using blockui but other people seem to like jqmodal

341250
opera	firefox
ie7 firefox 3 can t show this image but in opera 9.5 it works fine

341294
realloc	malloc
if you wanted to use realloc on this later you would create the array on the heap using malloc like this

341294
realloc	malloc
so that the malloc library and thus realloc etc. knows about your array

341313
minimum	max
this would ensure that there is at least one element and max would return it only if it is actually the minimum

341317
getter	setter
write getter setter functions that operate on pointers to that struct

341327
width	height
i assume that it uploads the original picture to a server and then stores the x y of the top left corner and the width and height

341330
int	double	int	chars
casting from chars to int short to int float to double are all promotions

341330
integer	unsigned
if the integer were negative the value would basically wrap around the maximal value of an unsigned int see 4.7 2

341357
post	get
maybe i ll get flamed to death for this post but i think this is an extraordinarily dangerous anti-pattern in security and design terms

341364
getter	setter
also wires up a method for the setter and getter

341364
getter	setter
the setter and getter method say the same

341468
setinterval	settimeout
first of all this right now i have a function that is recursive calls itself through settimeout screams setinterval to me if you re not varying the period

341481
unicode	ucs
to support them all it might be best to support the ucs unicode from the start

341494
int	double
they can just be renamings of a data type with no change in the bits represented most casts between integral types and pointers are like this or conversions that don t even preserve length such as between double and int on most compilers

341594
disk	ram
i m trying to get information like os version hard disk space disk space available and installed ram on a linux system in c++

341704
cvs	svn
i have found svn a lot easier to explain than say cvs as everything appears to be folders although it will use shallow copies

341758
valgrind	gprof
the two classical answers assuming you are in nix world are valgrind and gprof

341803
floating-point	integer
easiest would be to just use floating-point coordinates and then just round to nearest integer to get the square

341831
webkit	gecko
i ve looked at the html layout engines like gecko and webkit but frankly i m overwhelmed by the number of options they have--i don t need a complete web browser

otoh if you gripe about symbian s little keyboard quirk take a gander at mouse events in android s mini-chrome.

341950
button	checkbox
each record in the gv had 2 button and one checkbox

341992
cvs	svn
i have done this with our svn setup and have seen it done with cvs as well...it s effective to a certain degree because it forces the developer to submit correct code and keeps your repository tidy

342007
ftp	telnet	nntp	telnet
from codeproject - only links starting with one of the recognized protocols http file mailto ftp https gopher nntp prospero telnet news wais outlook are recognized and reformatted

342008
gtk	vte
do you know of any other terminal-like gtk components that can be built under windows or some way to build vte

342056
realloc	malloc
setting a to null works because realloc treats this as if the user called malloc size

342057
filesystems	hfs+
let s say i want to target the hfs+ filesystems in mac os x

342089
put	get
simple well written and well-indexed auditing triggers are generally not too evil - they only get bad when you try to put too much logic in the trigger

342137
cassini	iis
i ve had problems with security thread.currentprincipal etc on cassini that just disappeared when i started debugging against iis

342163
ssl	https
this certificate must then be imported into the web server to enable https over ssl

342170
put	get
the natural application for c++ cli is to write skinny little interop pieces and the default behaviour of vs on these projects is to put all the code into the headers which is about as anti-pimpl as you can get

342212
width	height
use getobject passing in a bitmap and the hbitmap to get the width and height and if the input bitmap is a dib the pixel data of the input hbitmap

i work with an application which uses rather big numbers and i need to store data as an unsigned 64-bit integer

342450
stdout	stderr
have a look at processbuilder class it gives you the option to capture the stdout and stderr of the process that it launches

342473
profiling	benchmarking
for keeping track and know everything about what your code does and how much resources it consumes i recommend you to use a profiling for php i the xdebug profiling there are also other options like apd and benchmarking profiling

342491
integer	radix
you can use big integer s tostring radix method like

342521
hex	binary
then open the compiled binary with a hex editior and look for it

342526
versioning	upgrade
will the next versioning of d3d only run on an os that requires new hardware is expensive and lots of people don t want to upgrade to

342543
pop-up	dialog
seeing how the .net s page progress window that pop-up isn t a dialog the back ground can be selected which then comes to the front in a half drawn locked up manner

342544
children	parent
especially avoiding the dreaded n+1 situation where you do one query for a parent record then an extra query for each of its children

342575
profiling	debugging
2 ways to debugging this either get a real heap profiling that can show you where your runaway class data is referenced or patch the api classes as described here

342696
pascal	delphi
i know delphi pascal supports them and as the inno scripting engine is based on it i m hoping it is supported

342705
ubuntu	debian
as used on debian and ubuntu

342734
trie	tree
a ternary tree trie would be more efficient

342764
getchar	fgetc
it is the value that getchar or fgetc getc returns if the stream is at end-of-file or a read error occurs

342764
int	chars
it is defined by the c standard as being negative whereas getchar returns chars as an unsigned chars converted to int

342775
trie	tree
both of the above are subject to steven a lowe s point that for strings a trie beats a normal tree

342785
put	get
i m assuming that since they are on a private network you re not running your own dns and thus to get at them via protocols that use ip names you need to put entries in hosts manually

342850
openbsd	freebsd
ifstated can be used as a front-end with pf on openbsd and freebsd to redirect traffic to online servers

342945
post	get
in your server-side code you would look into the post or get data for the name of the checkbox

342978
textile	bbcode
markdown bbcode textile mediawiki markup are all basically the same general concept so i would really just lump this into two categories html and plain text markup

343076
int	double
first as mentioned previously you need lf instead of d to display the double otherwise it will just display zero all the time d is for a signed int

343160
lisp	scheme
good sources include lisp in small pieces and marc feeley s scheme in 90 minutes presentation

343161
hide	show
for a solution if you only need to show or hide a div the best way is to do it from javascript client side by changing the style visibility of that div and not by cloning it

343191
superclass	subclassing
superclass receive this message before their subclassing

343196
bazaar	git
here is a comparison table between git hg and bazaar

343210
concave	convex
i found the computational geometry algorithms library in my search for an algorithm to decompose a concave polygon into the minimum number of convex components

343218
onfocus	onblur
i ve encountered this annoying feature before and my solution at the time was to use the onfocus event to record the current value of the text box and then use the onblur event to check whether the current value now matches the value saved during onfocus

343240
wav	aiff
i already know how to record but only to lossless formats such as wav and aiff

343288
post	get
i envision enabling all interaction with the site via post and get which would look something like this

343288
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest requires get post put and delete

343299
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
edit i m currently using system.data.oracleclient but willing to accept solutions using another provider odp.net devart etc..

343306
post	put
there s post and put or delete why have action add and action delete

343309
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
do you use odp.net or the devart provider aka as corelab provider or do you use the microsoft provider for oracle system.data.oracleclient

343356
google-chrome	firefox
i can run firefox or google-chrome and get another session but the app isn t supported in these browsers

343439
pull	push
consider using some ipc that involves only a push or a pull and not both as does the filesystem such as an http post a jms or msmq queue etc

343441
hash	md5
the client uses the md5 hash algorithm to create a fingerprint of the data and password combined and then sends the fingerprint as a response

343466
ilist	icollection
i know about interfaces such as ilist and icollection which do offer a count property but it seems like these interfaces were designed for mutable data structures first and use as a read only interface seems like an afterthought - the presence of an isreadonly field and mutators throwing exceptions when this property is true is imo ample evidence for this

343474
inherited	properties
since it s an interface you would have to implement the count properties yourself why don t you create a new interface that inherited ienumerator and add a count properties

343478
ienumerable	icollection
the key difference between the icollection family and the ienumerable family is the absence of certainty as to the count of items present quite often the items will be generated loaded hydrated as needed - in some cases an enumerable may not ever finish generating results which is why the count is missing

343486
ilist	icollection
ilist or icollection would be the way to go if you want to use the standard interfaces

343551
vmware	virtualbox
between hyperv vmware and virtualbox there are much better alternatives available

343721
bazaar	svn
is there any equivalent of svn id in bazaar

343794
post	get
if the method attribute is post case insensitive get the action attribute to get the url of the request can be relative

343794
post	get
these names and values must be url encoded in get requests but not in post ones

343797
bazaar	git
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools

343951
sum	datepart

crypt	hash
i d like to maintain the same user base but the passwords are hash using the php crypt function

343995
crypt	hash
crypt in this case is using the crypt_md5 implementation - the hash all start with 1

343995
crypt	md5
i ve tried phalanger but it doesn t have an md5 implementation of the crypt function

343995
crypt	md5
the c# example of crypt on codeproject uses des not md5

344020
width	height
one rule of thumb i ve found is to never set the actual height or width properties of a control

344080
post	get
for web apps on the other hand the only communication with the server is get and post requests so the user interface is much clunkier

344132
vbscript	jscript
but i prefer using cscript vbscript or even jscript

344263
sorting	filtering
i want to pass the params collection from the controller to the model to parse filtering and sorting conditions

344281
folder	directory
the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for

344281
folder	directory
it would then move the selected folder to a specific centralized backup directory - where it would also generate a readme.txt file outlining the backup details

344310
bazaar	git
i quite like bazaar but git is very popular too although i don t know how good its windows support is since it is primarily a nix tool developed for the linux kernel

344419
folder	directory
bonus what if i want to place that folder outside the public directory

344425
googletest	cppunit
i ve had success with both cppunit and googletest

when displaying modal dialog just invoke show and hide wait screen methods

344547
onenote	ms-office
make sure onenote got installed with ms-office

344591
teamcity	nant
the problem is that nant is invoked from teamcity which runs under the system account on the build server and there is no way that i can find to give the build server system account access to the dmz webserver directories

344670
public	protected
you want propertyofbase to act as public in the context of mytype.mymethod but to be protected in all other situations

344673
children	parent
using a list array will mean doing some index book-keeping to traverse the tree so it might be easiest to use just keep references to the children in the parent

344698
google-chrome	firefox
the usual suspects visual studio sql management studio firefox google-chrome etc..

344761
width	height
a desktop app tends to be built for a minimum height width resolution often 800 600 and tries as hard as it can to fit all the relevant information into a size smaller than that because scroll bars are generally very bad practice for non-tabular list data

344763
nofollow	noindex
chances are the search spiders are already especially google yahoo and msn searching the nofollow pages because they still have to hit those pages to see if they have a noindex

344781
cpu	irq
seriously even if you would have all the specs for all the components usb dma irq your cpu... you will find that a some things are not specified what happens if you send a certain sequence to your usb device and b some things are just bugged and you need to work around them the dozens of bugs in the cpu that are detailed in the cpu errata that both intel and amd publish

344949
folder	directory
i also randomly open a lot of putty sessions to various machines so i like to create a bin directory in my home folder add it to the path and then create a shortcut to putty in it named p among other shortcuts

344964
getter	setter
it s important to make sure the new property has both getter and setter or you ll wind up with really odd behavior

344997
cvs	svn
doesn t always follow cvs svn semantics and isn t organized around files

345001
versioning	upgrade
we have a xcopy versioning and click once deployment of it that allows the user to click on a link in the browser to download and install.when we upgrade the app all we need to do is to publish it on to the server and send an email with a link

345027
kermit	zmodem
my task appears simple at first dial into a terminal over a modem login possibly send some other characters and then receive file s via zmodem or kermit

345027
kermit	zmodem
or send a file via zmodem or kermit

345027
kermit	zmodem
i m curious if anyone knows of a free library for serial communication for windows which supports the zmodem or kermit protocols

345085
cos	sine	cos	sin
if you need the sine or cosine of something you hit the sin or cos button on your calculator and you re set

345132
cos	sin
i m not much of a mathematician but my understanding of where sin cos and tan come from is that they are in a sense observed when you re working with right-angle triangles

345132
cos	sin
if you take measurements of the lengths of sides of a bunch of different right-angle triangles and plot the points on a graph you can get sin cos and tan out of that

345184
late-binding	early-binding
in the first sample code you have provided you are doing an early-binding and in the second one you are doing a late-binding

345203

345334
post	get
the test client acts as a simple web browser and lets you make get and post requests to your django views

345339
winpcap	libpcap
packet capture functionality requires kernel mode support hence you will at the very least need to have your application require or install libpcap winpcap as will dean pointed out

345339
winpcap	libpcap
if you re using windows you re more or less on your own although winpcap programming is extremely similar to libpcap programming unsurprisingly since it s a libpcap port to win32. the sdk can be found here

345403
many-to-many	one-to-many
yes you ll need to understand what a foreign key is and the difference between many-to-many and one-to-many etc. but you should think about your models in terms of django classes

345404
ant	maven
i have used microsoft visual studio projects solutions to organize .net-based systems ant or maven 2 for java-based systems and i have begun using distutils and setuptools easyinstall for python-based systems

345414
iprincipal	iidentity
the web site using forms authentication internally which invokes an authenticatecustomer method on the service that returns a boolean result can add an additional claim to the list of credentials something like joe example.com is logged in as a customer. then somehow a custom iidentity object and iprincipal could be constructed on the service with that claim the wcf service being confident that the web site has properly authenticated the customer it will know that the claim hasn t been tampered with at least because it ll know the web site s certificate ahead of time

345428
folder	directory
file libgadu.h which appeard in include folder i copied to another folder which is marked in vs as including files directory

345432
post	get
it seems with a regular cocoa webview there a delegate methods that get called for each resource request and post load -didfinishloadingfromdatasource which you could use to roll your own caching

345529
inherited	properties
once you set the site on a gallery all its photos will inherited this properties

345536
bash	subshell
in bash you can use subshell to execute the command pipelines individually by enclosing the pipeline within parenthesis

345592
strsplit	substr
also i would suggest using the instance method strsplit rather than the combination of indexof and substr

345632
cat	tee
cat etc passwd | head -101 | tail -3 nl etc passwd | head -15 | cut -d -f1 cat etc passwd | cut -d -f1 5 | tee users.txt nl etc passwd | tail -1 | cut -f1 ls home | nl | tail -1 | cut -f1 ls -lr 2 dev null | sort -n -r +4 | head -1

345688
gentoo	linux
an active linux machine or use a livecd option on your poweredge such as knoppix or gentoo livecd

345688
vmware	esx
usr lib vmware installer vmware-vmvisor-big-3.5.0_update_2-110271.i386.dd.bz2 is the name of the dd file in your iso run tar ztf mnt esx install.tgz to see what your exact file name is it should be similar and relatively obvious

345691

345827
hash	md5
in that case why not get the md5 hash and compare those

345881
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
a lisp scheme ml or haskell closure does not create a new function dynamically

346080
pascal	delphi
later on i moved to pascal then to delphi java and c++ c#

346088
hash	md5
md5 hash or checksums as suggested above a simple diff ignoring whitespace and filtering out comment changes or changlist information from your version control system can signal which files have changed

346117

sub maintainer s repository git push git pull mail

346117
pull	push
upstream repository git push git pull mail

346175
x86	64bit
in 64bit versions of windows 32 bit software is installed in c program files x86

346176
x86	64bit
my solution is to look whether c program files x86 exists if it exists asume this is a 64bit os

346183
getter	setter
rather than marking all instance data public you create getter setter for those that need to be accessed to the outside world

346186
windows	wow64
it will be empty on a 32 bit version of windows and i believe on a wow64 process

346241
subnet	packets
if your udp socket is listening on a particular port and bound to inaddr_any aka 0.0.0.0 then it ll receive all packets sent to that port regardless of whether they were sent to the local machine s specific ip addresses unicast or to the local subnet s broadcast address

346291
put	get
we then get all the metadata associated with this method and serialize the whole mess via xml compress it and put it in our database

346304
cvs	rcs
both rcs and cvs produce strings that look exactly like that

346308
jboss	weblogic
some application servers web services stacks will handle wss usernametoken profile jboss websphere and weblogic

346403
ninject	spring.net
having recently spiked the use of 6 of these windsor unity spring.net autofac ninject structuremap i can offer a quick summary of each our selection criteria and our final choice

346471
inherited	subclassing
overly-complicated inherited trees where the subclassing do very different things and are only tangentially related to one another

346523
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
i only have add subtract divide multiplying parameters and and or in my expression tree

346531
wordpress	phpbb
i m migrating my wordpress blog and phpbb forum into a new hosting server

346541
int	chars
on most modern machines a chars is 1 byte and an int is 4 bytes so giving x.b the value c also gives the first byte of x.a that same value

346566
int	double
that union will actually be able to point to an int and a double

346579
int	double
allocates at least sizeof int +sizeof long +sizeof double +sizeof long double bytes in memory for each instance

346579
int	double
so sizeof union foobarbazquux_u â max sizeof int sizeof long sizeof double sizeof long double again with the possibility of some addition for alignments

346666
webkit	blink
mozilla webkit blink v8 rhino and actionscript provide a non-standard __proto__ property which allow changing the prototype of an object after it has been created

346666
inherited	properties
however note that only the properties of an object can be inherited

346671
put	get
once a refrigerator is opened your character can look-in it to get a list of visible contents can remove an object from it put an object in it etc

346692
migrate	staging
i have written a very simple bash script to help me migrate from dev to staging

346711
solaris	aix
be aware if you need to move to a platform such as solaris aix hp-ux

346785
phpunit	simpletest
unit test frameworks for php comprise phpunit and simpletest that have been compared on stackoverflow

346826
hash	hmac
obviously i can t use a one-way hash because i need the original data to create a hmac to send to aws

346863
innodb	myisam
are you using innodb or myisam

346863
innodb	myisam
in myisam count is basically free but in innodb it has to physically count the rows

346899
subtract	add
to subtract y from x negate y and add

346926
firefox	safari
problem doesn t occur when i use safari nor when i use firefox with the same site running from localhost

346953
width	margin
by default divs are block elements and take up the entire width of their parent - in this case the entire document propagating through the #outer div so the automatic margin style has no effect

346953
width	margin
for this technique to work you simply have to set the width of the div that has margin auto to anything but auto or inherit either a fixed pixel value or a percentage

346973
mouse	keyboard
it s quite annoying to follow such buttons with mouse if you need to scroll through several pictures so i want to keep mouse position constant relative to clicked button but only if it was clicked by mouse not keyboard

346995

i m doing some coding in jsp java without any framework or other strange things and i get stuck trying to find a way to check if a remote image by url meets some specifications like some defined height and width

347059
lisp	scheme
here s what i wrote about a year ago in common lisp but it s easily convertible to scheme

347061
boost	stl
also do not forget unlike c c++ has some very capable libraries backing it up stl boost etc

347088
post	get
in a php project i m developing i have a couple of requests that can be either post or get

347100
packets	multicast
if you re using raw udp multicast you re probably doing some sort of protocol sequencing in userspace in order to deal with lost or duplicated packets

347110
post	get
request_method isn t limited to post and get though - you also need to handle head iirc php will terminate the script at the first sign of output when it sees that header and on unlikely setups you might get a few webdav ones

347130
post	get
cookies do override values coming from post and get but all three values are directly controlled by the client making the request

347130
post	get
if you want get and post to have priority over cookies you can set the variable request_order in your php.ini

347130
post	get
which gives post priority over get over cookies

347167
postgresql	mysql
this will work for mysql postgresql oracle and probably any other db

347173
cvs	svn
the project files for each of these ides are perfectly manageable with cvs and svn

347194
migrate	upgrade
i ve upgrade a tfs server from 2005 to 2008 but never migrate projects from one to the other

347202
rss	feed
if you know a certain model won t be generating new data frequently like a model that parses an rss feed you can just have it stuffed somewhere with all the parsed data and have it refreshed every once in a while

347219
pop-up	dialog
i have a modal dialog box that pop-up and requests user input

347292
put	get
any paths defined in files in those directories get appended automatically to path variable -- i mostly use those two directories to put third-party installed applications in the path

347383
eurekalog	madexcept
but if you want a stack trace you could use one of the 3rdparty tools madexcept eurekalog or the open source jcldebug part of the jcl

347388
getter	setter
testing getter and setter

347395
getter	setter
the single exception for this is properties which can make one part the getter or the setter more private than the overall property by specifying an access modifier

347402
int	chars
if you are using regular main int argc chars argv then make sure your app is a console app

347428
rss	feed
additionally put your feed through an rss validator just to see if it checks out

347436
filesystems	fat
if you delete a file on a fat or udf filesystems its directory entry simply gets marked as deleted with most of the dir entry still intact

347439
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have a mouseenter and mouseleave event for a panel control that changes the backcolor when the mouseenter and goes back to white when it leaves

347439
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have label control within this panel as well but when the mouseenter the label control the mouseleave event for the panel fires

347459
getter	setter
it is also questionable if it is worthwhile testing truly trivial functionality such as getter and setter although you never know how long they will be trivial

347504
rss	feed
i want to provide some rss feed s for my site

347505
ussd	smpp
ussd works using a connection oriented smpp

347585
union	distinct
if you don t create any aliased pointers of distinct types in the first place then you don t have to worry what the compiler might do with aliases and neither does the maintenance programmer who sees your multiple static_casts through a union

347630
versioning	upgrade
you don t have to upgrade your sql anywhere versioning 10 database

347644
integer	unsigned
to get a better feel for this you could try creating a signed integer out of your unsigned integer

347644
integer	unsigned
if the msb of your unsigned integer is already 0 then you can read it as signed and get the same result

347644
subtract	add
now you have two signed numbers that you can add or subtract the way you already know

347774
versioning	upgrade
since all teams will based their work on those frameworks they need to upgrade their versioning of framework as soon as possible in order to build their own deliveries

347798
hide	show
also in case there isn t what other method can i use instead of show hide or other effects

347798
hide	show
obviously i don t want to show hide or affect the element every time just to change its id

347813
boost	stl
i know there is the stl and boost and all kinds of libraries out there but they are not all of a piece they all feel different

347850
mouse	keyboard
further creating a different experience for a mouse user versus a keyboard user also goes against most current wisdom on good ui design

347867
versioning	upgrade
the .net runtime itself has been upgrade with what amounts to a service pack in the 3.5 versioning

347884
children	parent
or if you ve three windows running - parent and two children which i think you might be implying then read write to a hidden field in the parent from the children

347964
hash	salt
add an authentication string to the query that is a salt hash of the access time

348000
hash	md5
he figured that no one would ever think to create a dictionary where they hash inputs with md5 and sha1

348005
min	max
they say that because of the property stated in the above paragraph we can calculate min and max in o 1 amortized time instead of o n time using an envelope algorithm

348109
hash	md5
does it make any difference if you mix md5 and sha1 for example instead of repeating the same hash function

348114
hash	salt
as you have already mentioned salt hash are much better

348114
hash	md5
i m still sticking with my answer that there are smaller number of md5 md5 text type hash than md5 text hash increasing the chance of collision even if still to an unlikely probability and reducing the search space

348124
hash	md5
however there exist large databases of md5 hash which are more likely to contain the password text than the md5 of it

348129
hash	md5
double hashing doesn t really help protect against this since the same collisions will still result in the same first hash which you can then md5 again to get the second hash

348132
post	get
there are different ways to get around this which i ve listed in this blog post of mine where i mainly talk about fcshctl which is my own solution for this but at the bottom of the post i ve also listed other similar solutions to get fcsh integrated into nonstandard build workflows

348140
pbkdf2	hash
a good key derivation algorithm like pbkdf2 injects the password into each round of hashing mitigating concerns about collisions in hash output

348155
jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	tapestry	wicket	tapestry	struts	struts	wicket
usually java is used on server side stuff so try to look into some spring wicket tapestry struts jsp jsf ibatis hibernate or other interesting stuff

348202
opera	firefox
ideally i want to have a message appear not a new window but a message box if possible that warns ie6 users of the issues and reccommends they update to either ie7 firefox 3 or opera 9.5

348236
filtering	grouping
there are several places where the user should be able to sort grouping and filtering results

348236
client-side	server-side
and question part two is there a way to generate the client-side views in javascript and the server-side views in erb from the same template

348236
sorting	filtering
perhaps send json from the server but also include the html snippet as an attribute so the javascript can do the filtering sorting etc

348246
singleton	facade
specifically factory abstract factory singleton facade

348250
mouseleave	mouseenter
a little bit down on this blog scroll down there is an implementation of how to implement mouseenter mouseleave cross browser

348250
hide	show
also your menu hiding showing will mostly work with the above check however if all you want to do is show and hide there exists perfectly valid pure css solutions for that

348293
ubuntu	linux
it receives support from the ubuntu people who make linux for human beings

348294
bazaar	git
for example try bazaar mercurial or git

348298

wordpress	phpbb
a typical lamp application like wordpress or phpbb runs more than 10 queries per pageview without problems

348310
width	height
measureit - draw out a ruler to get the pixel width and height of any elements on a webpage

348347
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
what you really want is to hash the password with pbkdf2 - a proven method of using a secure hash with salt and iterations

348355
cas	siteminder
popular systems are cas oracle access manager ca siteminder sun sso and ibm tivoli access manager

348358
rss	feed
this service reads given rss feed combines new items into a pdf and e-mails the pdf to given address on schedule

348408
getter	setter
this annotation would generate a simple getter and setter for you

348414
bazaar	git
mercurial git or bazaar is the way to go for a dead simple setup

348436
hash	salt
better is to salt your hash and mix hash together

348449
hash	salt	int	double
instead of doubling the number of times you calculate the hash double the size of your salt or double the number of bits used int the hash or do both

348502
folder	directory
i have created an application that writes some data to the root folder of the directory in which it was installed in program files

348508
versioning	upgrade
you care about your data the plone community cares about their data â and we d like you to be able to upgrade to the new and better versioning even when we re transitioning to a new architecture

348548
post	get
on a side note i found ci to be way too restrictive for one it doesnt allow for get requests and wants all interactions to happen via post

348548
codeigniter	kohana
apparently i am not the only one who thinks that codeigniter is overly restrictive the kohana project is a fork of codeigniter + optimizations namely pure php5 support all oo codeigniter is still php4 compatible at the expense of not being able to take advantage of php5 oo capabilities

348548
codeigniter	kohana
i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv

348555
put	get
but i would say to put as little as is necessary to get a birds eye view of how your program works

348608
client-side	server-side
there s redundant data now but all the rendering is done server-side and all the interaction is done client-side

348608
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
storing the all_available_data lets you do sorting filtering grouping etc

348704
hash	salt
i want to salt a hash username and password submitted via http post in js on the client-side with a higher-order time value 1 minute resolution to avoid sending the username and password hash as a constant value that could be used for a log-in attempt via post fabrication by an unauthorized user a sniffer

348704
salt	md5
if they inspect the js and see that it uses this time salt how much easier will it make the job of breaking the md5 if they know what the salt is

348722
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
their job will become infeasible since you can t use a rainbow table at all if the hash is salt correctly and you can t break md5 in less than a minute by which time the hash is invalidated anyway

348724
gridview	rowdatabound
i can quite easily calculate these values by aggregating information taken from the rowdatabound event but don t know how to go about manually adding the additional two rows to the gridview

348794
autocomplete	multi-select
in my case i want to implement a multi-select autocomplete combobox using html javascript and jsp

348825
ant	maven
the ant builder is kind of a swiss army knife for anything you want to automate in the project build without having to use the big tools like maven

348830
for-loop	loops
i++ loops are nooby but only because the code becomes much clearer if you use a for-loop

348934
factories	presenter
presenter and views that belong together are created by a factories on a separate thread and should get a separate dispatcher

348941
post	get
this should be a post via a form not a href link get

348977
ienumerable	ienumerator
the foreach statement usually uses ienumerable and ienumerator or their generic cousins

348995
margin	font-size
even if you hard-code the font-size in pixel you can still use em for unit to specify margin length etc

349027
urllib	httplib
not having to search though the docs of urllib urllib2 and httplib to find where that functions i need to to encode a file and upload it via a post request

349087
button	checkbox
on click of a button it should be checked that if any checkbox is checked or not

349104
getter	setter
edit project lombok solves exactly the problem of getter and setter generation

349129
folder	directory
if you place your build files in a different directory from your source as i do you don t have the folder in the tree to worry about

349139
jar	manifest.mf
i think you have to set it in the manifest.mf file in the ejb jar

349167
doc	rtf
aspose.words for java supports doc ooxml rtf html and opendocument formats

349172
queue	fifo
we have written once a thread-safe fifo queue class which is very helpful in a multithreaded environment

349207
subtraction	multiplication
the last one could be even faster once it got compiled both have one if and one subtraction but the first one has a multiplication in some cases the last one has not

349248
folder	directory
my csv repo has an empty directory obj in every folder

349259
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems have improved at this in general but i don t know what the current state is with ntfs and fat32

349289
draggable	droppable
jquery has draggable droppable classes to do what you need haven t used them tho

349313
windows	wow64
wow64 is a compatibility environment provided by the operating system that allows a 32-bit application to run on a windows 64-bit operating system

349313
disk	ram
better ram and disk performance will certainly help

349326
folder	directory
since they are closely aligned with the jsps is it a good idea to create a new top-level directory resources and mirror the jsp structure under this folder

349377
versioning	upgrade
do the tests from versioning to versioning for some useful set of upgrade

349421
java.util.date	simpledateformat
allows the formatting of java.util.date instances using the same patterns defined by the simpledateformat class

349440
installation	upgrade
we have one sql script that does both a clean installation and an upgrade

349440
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
this way we re guaranteed that the upgrade script will bring even the oldest installation up to the latest versioning

349472
lxml	elementtree
usually i would suggest using elementtree s iterparse or for extra-speed its counterpart from lxml

wmv	asf
using asf view i can see that the source wmv file appears to have incorrect data in its bitmapinfoheader structure it reports that is has 4 3 dimensions but is actually 16 9 but is there an equivalent tool for mp4 files so i can check whether this problem has been carried through to the transcoded file

349492
gtk	motif
wx was designed to do this from the beginning - gtk and motif versions on x11 win32 on windows and iirc an osx version

349501
int	boolean
this can also be extended to weighted edges by using int or another numeric type instead of boolean as the elements of the array

349564
apache	lighttpd
i am using django as web framework and then apache and lighttpd as web server and static media server respectively

349564
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd is running on a different machine from the apache django one

349601
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
somebody always throws in joda-time any time a java.util.date or java.util.calendar question is raised but including yet another library is not always an option

349605
redmine	trac
the major ones i ve looked at so far are activecollab redmine fogbugz and trac right now redmine feels to be the most fitting

349646
int	boolean
the easiest way to do this would be to use a square matrix 2d array either of boolean to show the presence or absence of a connection or int to represent the cost of traversal

349719
width	margin
what you need to do is get the padding margin and border width-values of that particular div and add them to the result of the width method

349725
width	margin
the every word as a textblock isn t really that bad of a hack and you can get around the issue of linebreaks by separating the linebreaks out into their own textblock and assigning those textblocks a width or margin equal to the width of the wrap panel which would force them to sit on their own line

349805
salt	md5
the time-based salt will not make md5 any easier to break

349805
hash	md5
you re still relying on 1 the user having a good password to defeat brute force calculations and 2 md5 being a decent hash

349805
hash	salt
because of the problems above a better idea is to use a one-time server-assigned salt with the hash since it sounds like you don t want to use ssl

349854
put	get
you can put these things in the classpath if your build tool doesn t get confused

349863
junit	testng
junit can t do that sort of thing -- though testng does have beforesuite and aftersuite annotations

349891
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and obviously google-chrome as well

349900
width	height
i find that trying to set a width height of a number without the units can cause issues

349910
post	put
thanks to this post that hanselman put up the day after i asked the question i downloaded wlw and am now using it

349924
unix	solaris
linux is seen as not as well supported as unix solaris or windows servers

349924
postgresql	mysql
mysql is a not ready for prime time db for hobbyists and not a competitor for sql server or oracle although postgresql seems to have a reputation for being more robust

349955
unix	solaris
linux is seen as not as well supported as unix solaris or windows servers

349989
postgresql	mysql
i d prefer to see postgresql or even sqlite take chunks out of the mysql market and i d like to see mono or jsp or cocoon based apps more

350050
postgresql	mysql
but many enterprises tend to use databases like oracle or ibm db2 instead of open source offerings - although there are many enterprises that don t really need the kind of power those systems provide and could get away with mysql or postgresql

350098
post	get
if you get this working please post - i could use it myself

350148
set	bag
the benefits you do get from the gridview include command events and arguments that can be easily consumed or created a datakey property bag that allows you to track critical fields in a large result set as well as many other things

350167
gridview	repeater
if you don t need any of the features of a gridview why not use a repeater

350199
google-chrome	firefox
firefox or google-chrome

350227
int	double
the only thing i can think of is that it s some odd casting thing but i get the same behaviour taking if the variable to which i m assigning is an int a double or even a string

350251
post	get
if you can bear the self-praising and claims to godness wolfram s book is a good way to get a feel for cellular automata but don t take the book itself too seriously that s a separate issue that can fill several blog post

350272
sorting	filtering
perhaps send json from the server but also include the html snippet as an attribute so the javascript can do the filtering sorting etc

350275
client-side	server-side
if performance is not a big concern i d go with an html parser like beautifulsoup in python if you are doing this server-side or jquery or just plain javascript if you are doing it client-side

350310

350381
sudo	nohup
sudo nohup nice foo.bash

350381
sudo	nohup
nohup nice sudo foo.bash

350395
mouse	keyboard
in that case you have to assume after a period of inactivity no mouse or keyboard events that the users attention has left the page

350403
sudo	nohup
the sudo should go last so that nohup and nice aren t running with root privileges

350405
sudo	nohup
sudo first will make it owned by root nohup before sudo will make it owned by your user

350621
children	parent
i also have used an adjacency table with fields ancestor and descendant and distance direct children parent have a distance of 1 grandchildren grandparents have a distance of 2 etc

350621
children	parent
this needs to be maintained but is fairly easy to do for inserts you use a transaction then put the direct link parent child distance 1 into the table then insert ignore a selection of existing parent children by adding distances i can pull up the sql when i have a chance which wants an index on each of the 3 fields for performance

353224
division	modulo
how do you do modulo get the remainder of a division

353224
division	modulo
but i m revisiting this because now i need to use negative numbers and rem gives you the remainder of a division which is not the same as modulo for negative numbers

353248
sequence	permutation
the good thing is that the algorithm works even when you have a sequence with repeated elements with say 232254421 it would find the tail as 54421 swap the 2 and 4 so 232454221 reverse the rest giving 232412245 which is the next permutation

353298
folder	directory
my answer is to move to point to a folder that is underneath the .sln file and adjacent to the class library directory then it can all go in the repo

353485
put	get
the query parameter takes an xmlnode and when i put this as the value i get an error

furthermore some things that are very difficult end up being solved with very little code and some things that are very easy boilerplate code like getter and setter for example can add a lot of lines in very little time

353573
versioning	upgrade
i think the web developers of the world should start a class action lawsuit to force microsoft ether to offer the equivilant of firebug for ie6 and ie7 make sure all ie6 and ie7 instances are upgrade to standards or remove all versioning of ie6 and ie7 from all computers on the internet or bail-out all web developers with a payment of 1m each for their pain and suffering

cos	sin	cos	atan2	atan2	sin
if you are averaging angles and have to deal with them crossing the 0 360 then it is safer to sum the sin and cos of each value and then average atan2 sum of sines sum of cosines

353831
sorting	filtering
edit one other caveat is that if necessary you can easily drop a dataview on top of this is you need to do some quick sorting filtering of the user list

353832
yacc	bison
for the most part folks use bison yacc which is a tool that you create a description for your high level language and the tool can parse the user input based on your description and turn it into this middle language if you will

354019
base-class	subclassing
it seems to me that the having a book base-class and then two subclassing for publisher and publisher name is the correct choice

354060
svg	vml
for vector drawing libraries like raphael provide a consistent api over svg and vml

354060
svg	vml
for html-only solutions no svg vml canvas you use css and custom border-widths

354089
put	get
however you will get different results in an outer join depending on if you put the join condition in the where vs the on clause

354098
base-class	subclassing
it seems to me that the having a book base-class and then two subclassing for publisher and publisher name is the correct choice

disk	ram
they are very close to the originally requested ram disk in a sku that you can purchase from newegg or amazon

354302
disk	ram
if you put the macro library and support libraries and your code on a ram disk compiling an application on an 80286 would go from 20 minutes to 30 seconds

354312
pull	push
edit i was under the impression that dedicated remote repos like github where no one will ssh in and work on that code but only pull or push etc didn t and shouldn t have a head because there was basically no working copy

354315
disk	ram
a ram disk might seem faster but that s because you aren t factoring in the copy to ramdisk and copy from ramdisk times

354317
int	chars
according to the documentation it s the number of chars for string and text columns and the number of bytes for binary and int columns

354327

354420
listview	gridview	gridview	detailsview
personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html

354442
allocator	stl
some kind of stl allocator class would work also but i am trying to avoid any kind of heap even static allocated per-thread heaps although one of those is my second choice

354442
allocator	stl
the reason i hadn t thought of doing it this way myself is that i have always overlooked the allocator object parameter to the stl collection constructors

354471
alloca	malloc
if you have an implementation of alloca you could buld a class allocator using that instead of malloc but your idea of using a statically allocated array is even better it s just as fast on most architectures and you don t risk stack corruption of you mess up

354481
allocator	stl
you can stick with your stl containers but change the second parameter of for example std vector to give it your custom allocator which allocates from a stack-buffer

354485
mvp	presenter
this makes having several views use the same presenter logic easy and shields users of my view from my particular architectural decision to use mvp

354515
nswindow	nscell
view layer nsview nswindow nscell their subclasses and calayer

354553
disk	ram
here is how to create a ram disk in linux

354564
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
nsurlconnection can be used synchronously via its asynchronous delegate methods in a background thread nsthread or nsoperation

354619
disk	ram
whether you end up with a ram disk or just letting the os do its thing this will help

354619
disk	ram
keep your source code on the real physical disk but direct .obj .dll and .exe files to be created on the ram drive

354622
pow	math.h
this functions calls pow from c stdlib s math.h

354635
ivar	subclassing
create an nsview subclassing that holds an nscolor as an ivar

354690
disk	ram
i wonder if you could build something like a software raid 1 where you have a physical disk partition as a member and a chunk of ram as a member

354703
folder	directory
the problem i have is just listing the directory in a folder

354733
gentoo	linux
see speeding up emerge with tmpfs gentoo linux wiki

354733
disk	ram
the gist is that all source and build intermediate file are redirected to a ram disk for compile while final binaries are directed to the hard drive for install

354733
disk	ram
also i recommend exploring maintaining your source on hard drive but git push your latest source changes to a clone respository that resides on the ram disk

354761
margin	text-align
so the layout can be centered by applying text-align center to the body and then margin auto to the left and right of the container div

354794
sqldatasource	detailsview
when you have parent-child tables and you wish to use a detailsview to edit the data how do you do it using a sqldatasource

354799
width	height
when text size increase the height and width change but the image doesn t increase in size

354800
put	get
therefore the perfectly valid phone number 0731602412 would get put into your database as the decimal number 124192010

354805
svg	vml
it uses native graphics svg vml silverlight or canvas mdash

354805
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
whatever is available on the client covering all major browsers ie firefox safari webkit opera

354808
width	height
if your header.png file was included as an img tag then you could set its height and width to be a number of ems and the browser would resize it usually making it look like crap though

354854
swt	swing
i was hoping to use of of the native toolkits not just swing swt

354881
client-side	server-side
if the request takes significant time it is possible that the client-side ajax request is timing out before your server-side code completes

354888
firefox	safari
this image displays perfectly well in safari but not at all in firefox

354936
post	get
i get a 2032 stream error from flash in response to post requests that return 201 created in ie firefox works fine

354949
std	ostream
rather than simply using std cout to print output have the libraries function take an ostream reference that defaults to std cout

354987
equals	compareto
however java does not offer parameter variance so there are situations where you will be overriding pre-generics functions such as equals compareto etc

355026
unix	solaris
as unix solaris or windows servers

355030
put	get
i d like to use posix semaphores to manage atomic get and put from a file representing a queue

355030
put	get
just in case anybody wants the larger context i am building get and put operations for an atomic queue that can be called from shell scripts

355093
serializable	deserialization
i coded around this for json serializable deserialization and found out the hard way

355135
hex	binary
if i compare the bytes of each file with a hex editor or kdiff3 they are binary identically the same

355189
for-loop	loops
the parameter for-loop needed to be set to false as the swf itself had a loops built into it

355220
int	double
in what way does it matter if the value is not a primitive datatype int double etc but a or a struct

355274
inherited	properties
to work around differences when classes don t share the same inherited tree using helpers makes it possible to have have generic count and items properties for example

355277
put	get
i ve seen too many junior programmers get confused when they put in a header file and then wonder why they get a link error for x being defined more than once

355295
post	get
if its a form post you can get the value with request.form control one of the properties will help you do it

355342
hide	show
in it show hide the elements that you want to be printed on paper

355405
folder	directory
for example you would create a new entry for myapplication.com and set its home directory to the proper folder on the server that contains your root files usually c inetpub wwwroot myapplication.com but it could be anywhere you like

355448
post	get
you can try to write a test in another language and see if it s faster or you can try to get the list of filenames through some other method such as described here in another post

355467
onclick	onmouseup
statement at the end of either the onclick or onmouseup event handlers

355469
listview	gridview
i found this when searching for the same question regarding the wpf listview s gridview

355469
post	get
there are a few nits to pick to get this to work really well which are all described in her blog post

355488
jrockit	hprof
jrockit might also not support the hprof format at all because it s not required by the java spec

355530
icmp	tcp	mtu	icmp
too many broken firewalls and middleboxes filter out icmp packet too big messages here is a good way to test a candidate network administrator during an interview ask him her to stop ping and he she will probably block completely icmp. see rfc 2923 tcp problems with path mtu discovery

355581
executable	upx
i m surprised this hasn t been mentioned yet but using upx-packed executable also increases the risk of producing false-positives from heuristic anti-virus software because statistically a lot of malware also uses upx

355628
put	get
i ve put indexes including covering indexes where applicable on all key tables run it through the query analyzer index tuning wizard etc but still cannot get it to perform fast enough

355675
min	max
if it s also got the method then it will also support sort min and max

355729
put	get
you could put the id information in the viewstate if you can t get it repeat without a long search process

355732
super	extends
so i extends file and use a delegate overriding all of file s constructors and methods calling super in all constructors

355755
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
do you reference system.data.oracleclient or do you use odp.net oracle s data provider for connecting .net apps with oracle or do you use devart s formerly known as corelab provider

355768
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
no you have spotted a problem with using inherited - that subclassing get tightly coupled to superclass and their internals so it can be fragile

355790
setinterval	settimeout
well the first thing to say is that if you re calling settimeout but not changing the interval you should be using setinterval

355790
setinterval	clearinterval
edit update from comment you can keep a reference from the closure if used as a class and setinterval clearinterval don t require re-referencing

355797
getter	setter
for me reason is quite simple if something bad happens with _name you can always put some output in getter setter and find out what is causing the trouble

355805
child-process	spawn
note that any child-process that your service spawn will also be in the service s session

355806
put	get
this means you still get the validation and you can easily put breakpoints on the property access

355806
min	max
this doesn t work where you re trying to make a change to two properties which validate against each other - for instance a min and max pair where each has a validation constraint such that at all times

355983
public	protected
guideline #4 a base class destructor should be either public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

356005
public	protected
personally we make sure that every public and protected method has xml comments

356008
public	protected
generally i try hard to add meaningful comments to all public protected members which is handy since if you turn on the xml comments during build you get automatic warnings for missing comments

356028
min	max
the use of min max value is very inelegant but i m not aware of a good way around it at the moment

356041
public	protected
i document public classes and the public protected members of those classes

356144
listview	gridview
i want to use the gridview mode of a listview to display a set of data that my program will be receiving from an external source

356239
gif	png
i can either draw a bitmap and save as gif jpg png put it up somewhere on the internet and link to it with an element

356239
mp3	wav
in the music world i can use wav or mp3 files

356245
post	get
when the ajax call is made from the browser you get it to post to the same action

356245
put	get
when you render the page the html for the form and all of the ajax stuff will get put in

356294
udp	tcp
i want to abstract this class to provide two versions one that connects through udp and the other through tcp

356294
udp	tcp
so the end benefit is that the genericness of t is still available but the very different code required to setup a udp or tcp connection has been specialized

356298
extjs	gxt
i am using gwt google web toolkit 1.5.3 et gxt extjs 1.2

356358
stdout	stderr
ideally i think that to avoid deadlock in java you need to spawn separate threads to read the stderr and the stdout

356385
udp	tcp
if you want to have a udp or a tcp connection based for example on a connection string provided the user then polimorphism best fits your needs

356394
debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
in my experience redhat centos is very good and apparently debian original not ubuntu

356396
vbscript	jscript
you can do something similar with vbscript but i m more comfortable in jscript

356403
int	boolean
the only time i can think where the more vebose code made sense was in pre-.net visual basic where true and false were actually int true -1 false 0 and boolean expressions were considered false if they evaluated to zero and true for any other nonzero values

356500
mockups	balsamiq
you should check out balsamiq mockups - excellent

356545
postgresql	mysql
you can check out the following link -- bob ippolito from mochimedia tells us why they ditched mysql for postgresql

356602
innodb	myisam
if your application generates a lot of updates you ll prefer innodb storage engine which allows to lock only one row when updating vs all the table on myisam

356667
hide	show
however you can get around this by creating an alert object setting the width manually or even dynamically and then using the popupmanager to show it place it where you want and hide it

356718
super	self
the call to the super cls self ._ _ new _ _ .... works but since i generate and return the same object as the one i call from as intended all the original args get passed to _ _ init _ _ working as intended so it bails

356774
inherited	properties
in your case because you inherited from observablecollection that would be the items properties

356795
affinity	processors
to specify processors affinity for a thread use the setthreadaffinitymask function

356796
hide	show
i have been using the asp.net ajax updatepanel control a lot lately for some intranet apps i ve been working on and for the most part i have been using it to dynamically refresh data or hide and show controls on a form based on the user s actions

356796
hide	show
now my problem is that there are times when i would like to wrap an updatepanel around a set of rows so that i can hide and show them dynamically but the updatepanel doesn t really let you do that

356828
min	max
the ref will have a min and max length too

356852
floating-point	fixed-point
is there a specific reason you re using floating-point for currency or would things be better off with an arbitrary-precision fixed-point number format

356873
width	margin
alternatively if the width of the first div is known you can add left margin to the second div

356882
portrait	landscape
most of the views are viewed in portrait but one should be viewed in landscape

356930
udp	tcp
both the udp and tcp objects must still support the same interface

356937
google-chrome	safari
jimmy has a very good point there google-chrome and safari are both based off webkit

356937
google-chrome	safari
if it fails on google-chrome chances are good it s likely breaking on safari nokia s60 browser and the rest as well

356941
width	margin
here you haven t given either div a new width or any additional instruction about where in the layout they should now go so it pins itself to the left margin and it s top margin finds the nearest block element to pin to still the body

356960
opera	firefox
opera ie firefox

357081
printf	strncpy
what you can do is use printf to write to a temporary string and then something like strncpy to copy only the bytes that you want

357111
factors	matrix
factors matrix m into xy where x and y are appropriate factorizations lu would be ok but for numerical stability i would think you would want to use qr or maybe svd

357144
post	get
try to use the post redirect get idiom after the postback is handled in page_load or a code-behind click handler redirect the page back to itself

357155
postgresql	mysql
however if and when a project gets to the point where you ll be deploying it i would suggest mysql or postgresql for better performance

357284
put	get
i do have to put a disclaimer on this the project is very early and i am an amateur at c++ at best so don t get your hopes up to much

357319
google-chrome	safari
this doesn t work on iphone because it won t show the image fullscreen safari google-chrome gets in the way

357353
curry	plai
for example if i do curry 0 the func x 1 line would be equivalent to curry 1 - does plai scheme do this

357384
superclass	subclassing
call super requiring subclassing to call a superclass s overridden method

357398
swt	swing
about 50 of the problems people have with jsf are because they try to treat it like a another taglib library rather than a ui framework like swing or swt

357428
int	chars
on a most basic level ascii chars string it is a sequential series of memory addresses each of which contain a short int corresponding to a ascii code and terminated by null chars 0

357441
ironruby	ironpython
microsoft are building a real javascript - not jscript - runtime along with ironpython ironruby and vb10 on the clr using the dlr but i can t find any downloads or content for it

357451
getter	setter
you are better off spending a few minutes exposing the property through getter setter than hours later tracking down a bug in some other code that modified the protected variable

357456
regasm	regsvr32
you should use the regasm utility to register an assembly just like you do regsvr32 with com servers

357483
nemerle	boo
boo or nemerle has something like this

357510
g++	gcc
outside of calling the wrong compiler using gcc instead of g++ see answer by dan it is possible but unusual to have gcc correctly built but g++ incorrectly built

357510
g++	gcc
it is also possible that your system came with just gcc and somebody installed g++ later into a different directory

357510
g++	gcc
if gcc is in say usr bin but g++ is in usr local bin then you may have this problem

357551
istream	getline
the second parameter to std istream getline is the maximum number of char s to read and store in the array minus one

357578
post	get
the following code compiles and runs fine but two tags named tdd get created so if i try to rename the tag i have to do it for all of the post instead of just the one tag object

357616
bazaar	cvs
i am relatively new to bazaar primarily used cvs then subversion and at my current job we re using sourceunsafe

357628
versioning	upgrade
important #2 - when extending remember that telligent releases two major versioning every year usually including features you d want for your project remember to review your changes and develop outside of the product core for easier upgrade to future versioning

357630
cairngorm	flex
i m working with a number of wcf services imported into flex builder 3 via data manage web services and i m wondering how to expose those services to the servicelocator in cairngorm

357638
min	max
limits.h contains the min and max values for ints as well as other data types which should be exactly what you need

357766
versioning	upgrade
any ideas on how to normalize teh download so we are not downloading 5x the data and same the disk size without having to go to manually updating project references where i have to change reference in vs for every versioning upgrade

357772
post	get
of course the original post begs the question how did you get that array that might contain duplicated entries in the first place

357778
hash	md5
key md5 hash

357778
memcached	apc
tempfile.php then either queries a db memcached with additional prepended key or apc for the content

357817
button	checkbox
for example if you have a panel that is 100 pixels wide by 30 pixels tall with a radio button at 10 10 and a checkbox at 80 10

357839
accessor	properties
as a web application project properties accessor don t work within the formview even with the embedded tabcontrol

357863
antlr	parser-generator
ps as a bonus if you ever do want to learn about writing your own parsers with lex yacc antlr javacc or other similar tools learning regular expressions is a great preparation because parser-generator tools use many of the same principles

357896
int	double
some of the members contain strings some others are double and some are int

357939
google-chrome	firefox
to baffle things even further this works when using ie6 but not firefox or google-chrome

357947
put	get
in fact that s when i realized the original programmer on here used the put instead of get method

357990
getter	setter
so if you end up writing really good integration acceptance tests all of your constructors and simple methods such as setter and getter should be called

358049
union	distinct
union expensive because the complete result set is subject to a distinct operation

358063
filtering	grouping
you can have parameterized queries so the user is prompted to input the relevant filtering customer id product grouping date range whatever

358080
telerik	componentart
and they cost a fraction of price than others componentart telerik

358111
width	height
width and height

358111
children	parent
a window has possibly a parent window and possibly children

358120
client-side	server-side
in order to deal with bugs arising from this problem like this one i need to add some validation code on the server-side which is only possible if the request actually goes to the server of which i am not sure at this point or on the client-side which cannot be very straightforward as you cannot access the actual file from the javascript sandbox

358153
google-chrome	firefox
i just created a composite image of screenshots of the google image in ie firefox google-chrome and they re all in perfect register top 2 images at 30 opacity

358155
np-hard	subset-sum
some cryptosystems based on np-hard problems have been proposed such as the merkle-hellman cryptosystem based on the subset-sum problem and the naccache-stern knapsack cryptosystem based on the knapsack problem but they have all been broken

358171
quicksort	shellsort
if you sort the array you will still need another pass to remove duplicates so the complexity is o n n in the worst case assuming quicksort or o n sqrt n using shellsort

358200
pop-up	dialog
i m new to the sliverlight framework and am just starting to figure it out but i have a similar need for a pop-up modal dialog box

358200
mouse	keyboard
now when the shield is visible it will also in effect block all input to the controls below at least from the mouse haven t tried keyboard yet

358245
fastcgi	scgi
no support for mod_python fastcgi or scgi

358254
trie	tree
you still have to maintain the tree itself with trie

358281
trie	tree
this seems to be sort of a trie but without the pointers which would surely get space-expensive if every character in the tree had a 4-byte pointer associated with it

358286
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to latest versioning of ado mdac sql server service packs etc

358287
cvs	svn
if nobody there knows about version control buy a pragmatic programmer s book on cvs or svn and set it up yourself

358289
openmpi	mpich
i believe it was both openmpi and mpich packages

358319
children	parent
the reason is that the needed grouping requires to identify both the names of all children of an ele somestring element and their parent

358339
put	get
suppose you put a hyperlink on your page with a get request like and then some search engine innocently follows the link as it s indexing your site

358398
post	get
i have a class called myclass which defines post and get methods

358398
post	get
i want the get method to know the value of the variables i got in post

i m trying to get some wpf concepts down so i ve put together a simple example of what i m trying to do

358449
public	protected
when using asp.net protected configuration how can i encrypt the config with just the public key

358553
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
if someone using safari opera or google-chrome comes along it ll just let the browser deal with it

358579
public	protected
my assumption from the debugger statement is that it is either unmarked public or protected

358610
inherited	properties	getter	setter
first of all it s usually better practice to use getter setter methods than accessing properties directly especially if you re going to be doing a lot of complicated inherited

358610
abstract-class	superclass
as for the generics problem you could try defining the cardbox getter in the superclass or top-level interface abstract-class as

358613
post	get
you haven t supplied any code but i am assuming you get a post and then you redirect to results which is a get

358613
post	get
this view in case of a post casues the client to issue a get request to whatever url is aliased some_target

358613
post	get
and this get will include foo parameter from the post

358613
post	get
mixing get and post parameters

358613
post	get
moving a parameter from post to get should be avoided imho

358615
pull	push
it also might be easier to use vba from within excel and pull the data from access and format it rather than push from access

358636
svg	vml
it uses native graphics svg vml silverlight or canvas mdash

358636
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
whatever is available on the client covering all major browsers ie firefox safari webkit opera

358636
opera	firefox
you can explore it on your own the previous link is a publicly available subversion repository but be warned it works only on firefox and opera with special 3d graphics add-ons from respective vendors

358672
ienumerable	iqueryable
the difference between iqueryable and ienumerable

however i was using a php generated stylesheet with the headers and every other information client-side cache server-side cache compression finely tuned in php for optimal performance

358819
prng	random
a random value preferrably a crypto-grade prng

358835
inherited	properties
is there an easy way to find all the properties in the inherited hierarchy for interfaces as in the first example

358875
direct3d	directdraw
and if that doesn t give you enough you can also use directdraw or direct3d

358880
opera	firefox
firefox and opera do not

358893
vim	jedit	jedit	textpad
edit after trying each and every option suggested below i am still using textpad on windows and vim on linux jedit was a good contender as a macro-capable texteditor on linux but the excessive startup time due to java is a no-go for me

358900
hide	show
you could then add the tooltip javascript code to hide those paragraphs and show them as tooltips on hover

358909
debian	linux
on linux i use debian lenny on kde i use vim or gvim which have an excellent macro-recording functionality in command mode simply type qx x being any letter record anything then in command mode type q to stop recording and later type x to replay the macro

358918
post	get
restfaces is a solution to the get post problem that many people complain about

358918
jsf	seam
seam collects many of the jsf best practices but i haven t used it yet so i can t really recommend it just recommend you to take a look at it

358936
sharepoint	spsite	spweb	spsite
the only things you need to watch our for are populating the fields check they exist first as sharepoint is customisable and someone could delete or rename a field and when you ve created the spweb and spsite objects be sure to dispose of them afterwards

358939
sorting	filtering
it s a problem of manipulating the table rows move rows for sorting hide rows for filtering there is no need for re-rendering

358967
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	linux
for instance this is done on linux through the so_passcred and so_peercred options on freebsd by passing messages that include the cmsgcred structure and on netbsd by setting the local_creds option

358999
rss	feed
i am familiar with the rss feed within teamcity but that is of no use as it is more of a history view

udp	tcp
from the tcp or udp point of view the packet does not contain ip addresses

359096
equals	gethashcode
it ll take around 8 or 9 comparisons in the binary search case against a single call to gethashcode and some number of calls to equals depending on hash collisions in the dictionary case

cpu	processors
passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors

360494
cpu	processors
active loadbalancing if there are 3 tasks 2 on one physical cpu and 1 on the other when the second physical processors goes idle the scheduler will attempt to migrate one of the tasks to it

360494
affinity	processors
it does this while attempting to keep thread affinity because when a thread migrates to another physical processors it will have to refill all levels of cache from main memory causing a stall in the task

360506
cpu	hyperthreading
however although you can learn multithreaded programming on a single-core box a dual-core or even hyperthreading cpu would be a great help

360514
affinity	processors
people use processors affinity to control for this but on linux the semantics of sched_affinity can vary a lot between distros kernels vendors etc

360514
affinity	processors
if you re on linux you can portably control processors affinity with the portable linux processors affinity library plpa

360563
firefox	safari
i ve noticed that firefox and safari both fire load events on new images no matter what but ie 6 7 only fire load if they actually have to get the image from the server -- they don t if the image is already in local cache

360563
firefox	safari
instead of just appending the image then building a handler i use this code which is tested good in safari firefox and ie6 7

360569
organization	naming
though this naming convention may help one to quickly determine what s scripted within a given file it doesn t help with file organization i can t sort by object type. therefore i would like to change the file naming convention

is there a reason for not creating a data structure that stores the fields of the file a string a boolean for m f an int and 3 int which you could make into a list that stores the values and then loop over it to compute various sums averages whatever other aggregate functions you d like

361049
ws-addressing	soap
doing some research i found out that wshttpbinding uses ws-addressing standards and reading about this standard i learned that the soap header is enhanced to include tags like â messageidâ â replytoâ â actionâ and â toâ

361049

datatrigger	eventtrigger
this is what conceptually i want to do but can t because you can t put a setter in an eventtrigger like you can with a datatrigger

361298
put	get
i just wanted to put you at the devguru vbscript docs i find they tend to be the good place to get quick vbscript answers

361362
int	double
afterthought - if myarray in not an elementary type int double but instead represents an array of objects with virtual members or pointers you ll need a means of serializing

361367
notepad++	jedit
in terms of software a nice gui editor along the lines of notepad++ or jedit would be good

361372

so far i found that we can buy typemock to mock the sharepoint objects and then use any free mocking framework moq

361430
folder	directory
is there a way to hide my src directory from launch services so that finder won t register applications in that folder

361440
hide	show
updatepanels or ajax postbacks in general should not be used to just hide or show elements

361478
uiview	subviews
uiview also can be made subviews of your 3-d view therefore they can appear above your rendering

361489
inherited	subclassing
i often see questions asking how the developer can inherited from a class but hide a method because that method should not exist on the subclassing

xfce	kde	xfce	gnome	kde	gnome
i understand gnome and xfce and kde and such are all desktop environments for linux and the base installed typically is x xorg

361662
gtk	xlib
i guess you could write c code directly against xlib but you d end up recreating all the functionality that gtk or qt provide that x doesn t alone

361673
mouse	keyboard
if you don t use an existing toolkit you ll need to write things at a very low level - directly handling mouse and keyboard events

361681
range	min
grid min value should be either 0 or a nice value lower than the min value of the data in range

361681
range	max
grid max value should be a nice value above the max value in the range

361704

gtk qt others are all so far as i know implemented in terms of xlib at their core

361908
ssl	https
if you want to optimize your site there are plenty of ways if ssl is the only way left buy a hardware accelerator....hmmm if you load an image using http will it be cached if you load it with https

361943
udp	rtp	udp	tcp
i wanted to know why udp is used in rtp rather than tcp

361952
post	get
i assume that if a post back occurs you d want to get rid of the message so make sure it s always off

362077
quicksort	mergesort
so for resursive algorithms like quicksort and mergesort we would actually do insertion sort for segments that were very smal say 10 records or so

362118
cpu	processors
furthermore with multiple processors other instructions can be executing on a different cpu core at the very same time

362127
folder	directory
vs looks in the project folder as well as the installation directory that wheelie mentioned

362227
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have a problem only in google-chrome firefox ie netscape safari and opera are okay where a padding property which should be applied to text in a cell is being applied to all empty cells aswell

362284
put	get
you can instead put a timestamp into the sql and use the time to the nearest minute hour day the largest period you can get away with to allow mysql to get some caching benefit

362289
put	get
you can put the complete string in and get the dec value of the hex string back

362390
integer	unsigned
to convert from unsigned byte to a java integer

362429
rss	feed
i ve created a utf8 encoded rss feed which presents news data drawn from a database

362429
rss	feed
so everything should be encoded in utf8 when the rss feed is presented to the browser however i am still getting the weird question mark characters for pound signs

362429
rss	feed
here is my rss feed code cfml

362441
integer	fractions
i have a decimal variable and i need to split it into two separate variables one containing the integer part and one containing the fractions part

362457
subclass	abstract-class
they cannot be instantiated so if you have an abstract-class with concrete methods then it can be subclassed and the subclass can then be instantiated

362480
postgresql	mysql
don t know about mysql but in case of postgresql you can specify whether the sequence is a cycle no cycle

362575
wicket	stripes
in practice with a jboss portal v2.4.2 server there appears to be some class-loading issues so things such as the downloadable stripes example or a standard wicket quickstart app don t run but i m not sure if the problem there is a server-specific one or a generic one - anyone

362719
getter	setter
or is it more recommended to set the member variables to private and let the subclasses get or set the varible by getter and setter

362719
getter	setter
and if it is recommended to use the getter and setter method when are protected variables used

362741
getter	setter
setter and getter are somewhat slower than accessing fields directly so if you are doing heavy maths and read write these fields a lot in your subclasses you should go for accessing the fields directly

362741
getter	setter
normally you should mark them as private and go for getter setter

362741
getter	setter
so my answer is direct access for heavily used fields getter setter otherwise

362749
delphi	oxygene
i have found many posts and examples of using linq-syntax in delphi prism oxygene but i have never found anything on linq to sql or entity framework

362760
memcpy	realloc
do realloc and memcpy copy the entries in an array to another in a way faster than just iterating on each element o n

362765
keydown	keyup
on the project i worked on with that requirement a teller system for bank tellers we had a lot of javascript monitoring key keypress keydown keyup etc. events and such

362767
jboss	weblogic
i have mixed servlets and portlets in a single web application using jboss portal bea weblogic portal and apache jetspeed 2

362770
implements	extends
my question is if an interface that is implements implicitly by extends a class that already implements it should be explicitly implements by the class if the class wants to advertise the fact that it fulfills the contract of that interface

362770
implements	extends
you implements this extends the class java.util.abstractlist that already implements the interface list

362786
implements	extends
if you are extends abstractlist which already implements list you do not need to explicitly implements list

362795
implements	extends
when you extends abstractlist mylist is of type list already so there is no need to explicityly stat or implements the interface

362804
post	get
one of the reasons i m not going to post details is because i m pretty sure i d get it wrong in at least some respects

362837
opera	firefox
it s not a full debugger but my dp_debug extensions provides some i think usful functionality and they work in ie firefox and opera 9+

362869
notepad	scite
maybe that s where scite with its lua scripting ability or programmer s notepad which seems to be scriptable with python has an edge.

362902
width	height
so i tried to set the layout size in report properties as width 18in and height 8.5in

362911
ienumerable	ilist
why ilist instead of ienumerable

363022
profiler	yourkit
if that doesn t help us a profiler such as yourkit to find the differences

363081
websphere	ibm
we use websphere integrated with several other ibm products to provide secure access to our application which has been working well for us so far

363086

then i manage myself the wm_mousehover and wm_mouseleave events to show hide the tooltips

363093
wxpython	pyglet
you can draw simple shapes to a canvas in all of pyglet pygame qt tkinter wxpython and cairo

363155
post	get	post	put	put	get
other than that some nice use of rails routes with conditions to call a different action on get post put etc and a prefix of api v1 and format format.xml format.js etc provides a pretty nice way to build restful apis withought really needing a plugin

363199
width	height
check the width and height property of the report surface carefully and squeeze them as much as possible

363209
folder	directory
what i want to do is for each file in the directory username.com move it to the folder of the same name in mail

363223
stdout	stderr
i want both stdout and stderr redirected to the terminal so that the user can see that the script is working as well as see if there was a problem

363223
stdout	stderr
edit redirecting stderr to stdout and piping the result to tee works but it depends on the users remembering to redirect and pipe the output

363224
post	get	post	put	put	get
i ve checked out django-rest-interface but it is not obvious on how to do anything other than read get create post update put delete delete and couldn t find any related examples

363239
stdout	stderr
depending on the shell you use you first have to redirect stderr to stdout using

363243
stdout	stderr
use the tee program and dup stderr to stdout

363257
stdout	stderr
the to redirect stderr to stdout append this at your command

363268
submit	submission
i am submission form with javascript like jquery form#listing submit so i must remove the validation rules function with javascript

363297
post	get
you can get a list of the post office address for each zip code and geocode each address into a lat long pair

363374
getter	setter
i generally don t make interfaces for data holding beans that is i don t make interfaces for classes with primitive type values and getter setter for them

363386
ienumerator	idisposable
but this isn t particularly efficient if it s actually a generic collection because ienumerator implements idisposable so the compiler has to put in a try finally with a dispose call in the finally block

363395
single-quotes	double-quotes
note that i changed the double-quotes surrounding article_desc to single-quotes as well

363434
ienumerable	icollection
without generics and because icollection implements ienumerable you can do like in example 1

363436
min	max
having e1.date min e2.date or e1.date max e2.date

363443
post	put
i would put the post in a div that would have a fixed width setting overflow to scroll or to hide completely depending on the content

363519
jobs	cron
and since cron jobs don t run under a terminal the combination of expect ssh

363594
inherited	subclassing
say the control class contains basic drawing functions ie paint - well control would become a basiccontroldelegate or similar and the subclassing would be created with a reference to a basiccontroldelegate which would be used for all inherited functionality

363598
put	get
anyway if you are using asp.net then the names get mangled to something like ctl100_table and you need to put this into the jquery instead of table

363600
scatter	graphing
edit charts is the component that allows statistical type graphing scatter plots and other charting stuff

363609
subtract	add
then put a filter search box with the option to select deselect all matching add to subtract from selection

363609
children	parent
still with the checkboxes but you can arrange listboxes next to each other populating children in the next box to the right as users select a parent node to view

363683
sdlc	methodology
does your company employ any methodology standards sdlc processes or are you a maverick it department

363732
range	max	range	min	min	max
in order to get the max value included you need to add 1 to your range parameter max - min and then truncate the decimal part by casting to an int

363740
folder	directory
in the partcover.browser i ve selected the mstest executable i ve pointed the working arguments to my tests.dll and i ve tried pointing my working directory to the testresults folder but i get an error

363833
implements	extends
i have implements a session timeout warning using javascript that simply asks the user if they want to extends their session or logout

363907
wxpython	listctrl
i assume that there s a way to do this with the wxpython toolkit but i can t figure out how to get a listbox or listctrl or any other class to do this short of doing an enormous amount of event-driven programming myself

363936
g++	gcc
how can you get a recent release 4.2+ of g++ gcc for windows

364022
getter	setter
this is because you re fooling the dependencyproperty system by doing this - remember getter setter of dp properties work differently than regular properties

364093
treeviewitem	menuitem
i think you need to realize that menus and treeviews are itemscontrols but then again so are menuitem and treeviewitem

364098
accessor	properties
if obj1 and obj2 are properties using synthesize-d accessor then method 1 and method 2 are equivalent

364114
maven	pom.xml
however sometimes i want to link to a 3rd party library that doesn t already have a pom.xml file defined so rather than create the pom.xml file for the 3rd party lib by hand and install it and add the dependency to my pom.xml i would just like to tell maven in addition to my defined dependencies include any jars that are in lib too.

364114
maven	pom.xml
short of that if there is a simple way to point maven to a lib directory and easily create a pom.xml with all the enclosed jars mapped to a single dependency which i could then name install and link to in one fell swoop would also suffice

364125
width	height
you should be making the view as big as the superview s -bounds if i get correctly what you want to do usually a rect from 0 0 to width height

364178
serializable	deserialization
i know how serializable and deserialization works but the example i followed when using binary serializable with java.io.serializable did not work in the same fashion as when i did it with say a simple object

364188
jar	war
note system dependencies are not copied into resulted jar war

364287
put	get
as long as the code wasn t obfuscated then you should be able to use reflector to get viable code if you then put it into vs you should immidiately find errors in the reflected code

364301
punctuation	words
i am trying to get fragments that start on a words character and end on punctuation but for some reason the fragments being returned to me seem to be very inflexible despite that i ve provided a large slop

364327
swt	swing
i want to get myself into programming some serious gui based applications but when i look at things like swing swt from java i can t help but hate programming a gui interface by creating widget objects and populating them and calling methods on them

364353
put	get
put them together and you get this

364361
innodb	myisam
you can use the mysql replication functionality or simply copy and paste the data files if your using myisam tables it s just a straight copy innodb tables are a little more tricky

364389
pop-up	dialog
the dialog are no longer pop-up windows so they work in more browsers

364433
entity-relationship	diagram
1. get an entity-relationship diagram that closely matches your target

364433
entity-relationship	diagram
2. create an sql script from the entity-relationship diagram and create the database

364433
postgresql	mysql
i suggest postgresql as some mysql

364488
int	double
it is possible for two objects of different types to be equal -- for example int and double if first class objects can validily be cast as each other and are comparable mathematically

364539
vim	sublimetext
my ideal editor would be netbeans feature set and easy of use sublimetext s performance and slick looks and a toggle to full vim mode

364584
int	double
4 as user cbo mentioned above double int being equal despite their types being different 4.0 4 and this applies to other types as well

364623
actionscript	haxe
the haxe compiler can produce swf files javascripts and other with a language that resembles actionscript or javascript more or less depending on what language details you care about

364687
put	get
i could change this to put on a background thread but then every component that needs access to this data would continuously have to get notified when this data was ready

364775
nexus	artifactory
we are considering nexus and artifactory

364816
next	except
it is just like a list comprehension except that it returns an iterator instead of the list ie an object with a next method that will yield the next element

364931
haskell	ocaml
bruce s basic idea is to use an explicit knot-tying operator called wrap instead of the implicit knot-tying that is done automatically in haskell ocaml and some other languages

364936
outputstream	inputstream
does anyone have any good suggestions for creating a pipe object in java which is both an inputstream and and outputstream since java does not have multiple inheritance and both of the streams are abstract classes instead of interfaces

364936
outputstream	inputstream
the underlying need is to have a single object that can be passed to things which need either an inputstream or an outputstream to pipe output from one thread to input for another

364939
outputstream	inputstream
easy way to write contents of a java inputstream to an outputstream

solaris	aix
i used the test program that follows on solaris aix hp-ux macos x linux and cygwin windows xp results below

364960
centos	linux
65536 - suse linux 10 and centos fcntl f_setfl failed

365000
stdout	stderr
that s why you re not able to just redirect its output to see what your app is sending to stdout or stderr

365000
stdout	stderr
you can use console.app to see the output of applications launched in the normal manner because the launch infrastructure specifically sends their stdout and stderr there

365034
outputstream	inputstream
you can t create a class which derives both from inputstream and outputstream because these aren t interfaces and they have common methods and java doesn t allow multiple inheritance the compiler doesn t know whether to call inputstream.close or outputstream.close if you call close on your new object

365056
bazaar	git
as source control why not a distributed system like git if you are not using windows mercurial or bazaar

365059
put	get
of course you need to put in the where clause what categories you want to get

365078
min	max
can t you just use the min and max aggregations on purchase date

365079
put	get
if you re using master pages put it in the your child page and not the master page because the code in the child pages will execute before the master page and if this is in the codebehind of master page you will still get the error if you re using ajax on the child pages

365110
mouse	keyboard
i m looking for ways to watch mouse and keyboard events on windows linux and mac from python

365149
hash	md5
calculate a hash value using an algorithm with a low probability of a birthday attach md5 sha-1

365180
punctuation	words
this regex will match between 402 and 602 characters where the first is a words character and the last is one of three punctuation characters

365183
updatepanel	contentplaceholder
do i just put an updatepanel around the contentplaceholder in the master page

365207
children	parent
for instance at a child care business at a mall you can require parent to check children in and the same parent to check them out

365207
children	parent
this type of thinking will sometimes lead to realization that part of security has to be in the parent hands you can t confine children in an online system so protecting them from going to the rest of the internet has to be their parent job

365424
dlopen	backtrace
gdb gives me a backtrace into the dlopen system call that appears meaningless

365424
dlsym	dlopen
i had taken a look at apache s guide and am fairly familiar with dlopen and dlsym and dlclose

365517
debian	linux
assuming you are on linux debian based systems have separate configurations for mod_php php cgi and php-cli

365525
rss	feed
the number of entries in the rss feed and the html page is not assumed to be the same

365525
post	get
we can only expect to get only those post that appear in both

365525
rss	feed
there may be a new entry in the html page that does not appear in the rss feed yet

365540
ienumerable	ienumerator
if they can explain deferred execution streaming the ienumerable ienumerator interfaces foreach iterator blocks expression trees for bonus points anyway then they can probably cope with the rest

365571
trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla	mantis	bugzilla
bug tracking trac not bugzilla mantis fogbuz

365571
ant	maven
if you need build scripts try ant or maven

365586
arp	bgp	arp	udp
everything from arp dns udp icmg bgp and on and on

365615
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
ever since i read that a for-loop works faster than a foreach loops a long time ago i assumed it stood true for all collections generic collections all arrays etc

365630
for-loop	loops
i did test it a while ago with the result that a for-loop is much faster than a foreach loops

365637
yacc	bison
and bison a hairy yacc yet another compiler compiler

365692
for-loop	arrays
the above is the same no matter what type your collection is whereas in your for-loop the following will not build if you changed mycollection from an arrays to a list

365694
notepad++	scite
finally concerning ides a good text editor such as notepad++ or scite will suffice

365782
boost	stl
there is a number of choices with c++ if you really like boost or stl then the answers below might be preferable but the simplest and probably fastest choice is to use a single dimensional array as in c

365783
sdlc	methodology
our sdlc methodology dictates what documents we need to write

365783
filtering	grouping
rather than create folders in sharepoint we create views to filtering and grouping documents

365802
put	get
or as an old professor of mine put it as you get older you learn to ask who knows something not what book it s in

365804
dlsym	dlopen
given that i know little about apache modules i would try to remove apache from the equation try writing a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits

365817
rss	feed
...and it should be able to produce an rss feed as well

365829
width	height
it is a bit cleaner to have a separate structure where you store the width the height and a pointer to the elements

365834
innodb	myisam
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

365834
innodb	myisam
having only one column that column being a primary key has an important consideration in the different ways that myisam and innodb handle primary key indexes

365834
int	double	innodb	myisam
this being the case i would expect that innodb might have an advantage in that myisam would essentially have to do double work -- write the int once in the data pages and then write it again in the index pages

365834
min	max
for either storage engine doing something like min or max should be trivial on an indexed column or just checking the existence of a number in the index

365873
scheme	rebol
i currently have installed on my device pythonce etcl dsforth pocketlogo the documents which comes with it is in german though rebol and pocket scheme

365887
free	malloc
see what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

365891
free	malloc
i m just going to direct you to this answer what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

365914
free	malloc
although malloc free and new delete have different behaviors they both do the same thing at a low level manage dynamically allocated memory

365914
free	malloc
the actual implementation of malloc and free can vary a lot since there are many ways to implement memory allocation

365916
pull	push
for this type of scenario and others jon skeet and myself wrote an alternative linq implementation that works as a push rather than a pull allowing you to feed data through multiple parallel processes at once

365926
outputstream	inputstream
if i understand you correctly you want an object that functions like an inputstream in one thread and an outputstream in another to create a means of communicating between the two threads

365938
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop or a while loops with a temporary result and a counter

365945
firefox	safari
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery

365945
post	get
i ll post more if i get any wiser

365997
pull	push
the exchanges are performed by both push and pull methods

366003
firefox	safari
make sure that you have the latest version there have been great progress for the javascript engines in the safari and firefox releases in recent time

366029
inherited	properties
array object inherited caller constructor length and name properties from function.prototype

366033
int	chars
each enumerated type shall be compatible with chars a signed int type or an

366033
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer type

366043
boost	stl
a lot of stl and boost

366050
post	get
if you want to write a program to fetch this information you will probably have to do something a little more complicated and fetch the page with the signature on it first so you can post that value back to the site to get a proper response

366086
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	getter	setter
in firefox opera 9.5+ and safari 3+ google-chrome and ie tested with v11 you can define getter and setter properties

366088
actionscript	mxml
the built-in flex builder will refuse to build the mxml file containing the testrunnerbase component as it is a pure actionscript project no flex allowed

366088
actionscript	mxml
it is impossible to add the mxml file to the actionscript applications list in the project settings

366129
interpreted-language	lolcode
if you want to build an interpreted-language on .net the dlr is the way to go - check out martin maly s lolcode sample at

366133
getter	setter
here s a link to douglas crockford s page on private members in javascript ....it would seem to me these would be read only if only getter methods are supplied and no setter

366134
g++	gcc
gcc g++ complains expected initializer before â â token

366209
trie	tree
you can by discipline use a tree of tuples as a trie but it s only by convention not enforcement

366215
swt	swing
the other advantage for using u++ over something like mfc wpf swing java swt python etc is that your executable do not have any baggage or dependencies

366215
jsf	stripes	struts	stripes
java might says struts jsf stripes but i don t think java has anything that can compete against frameworks from python ruby c# or even php these days

366240
int	double
that s because 1 and 3 are treated as int when you don t specify otherwise so 1 3 evaluates to the int 0 which is then cast to the double 0

366253
int	double
if you have int s that you want to divide using floating-point division you ll have to cast the int to a double

366257
udp	tcp
so i am doing a lot of high performance network programming using boost asio or just asio if you will and have a pretty solid grasp of the essentials of both tcp and udp protocols

366266
apache	lighttpd	opera	firefox
apache iis lighttpd firefox opera webkit etc.

366377
late-binding	early-binding
conceptually what is the difference between early-binding and late-binding

366407
pull	push
i allready finished allmost all git commands i ever use push pull fetch stash branch commit merge format-patch am apply etc so it should be usable pretty soon

366408
post	get
you can use jquery framework its javascript library you can use default image or span or div or anything else even anchor tags to do submit button its easy to use and can post form data by post method or get method through ajax just visit jquery website jquery

366421
turbogears	cherrypy
i am wondering how do i redirect my browser to the external website say www.yahoo.com from my cherrypy turbogears app

366452
klocwork	coverity
there are more expensive commercial tools such as klocwork and coverity

366477
sqldatasource	objectdatasource	sqldatasource	linqdatasource	linqdatasource	objectdatasource
daniel i needed something similar so i derived from a label and bound it directly to the events raised by the various datasourcecontrol derivatives linqdatasource objectdatasource sqldatasource

366627
svg	vml
vml is vector markup language a kind of proprietary ancestor of svg

366627
svg	vml
i searched svg vml library in google and was surprised there are lot of libraries apparently

366658
jvisualvm	jprofiler
so i ran it up under my profiler jprofiler and using jvisualvm and both of them indicate the usual moderate heap and perm-gen usages of around 30m combined even when fully active doing my load-test cycle

366706
subtraction	addition
they both work for addition and the c program works for subtraction as well

366740
actionscript	mxml	folder	directory
i ended up putting the unit test mxml file in the original project creating a new flex project deleting the src directory and replacing it with an eclipse linked folder to the src directory of the actionscript project

366741
inherited	subclassing
some languages like java have a fairly limited set of language features available meaning that subclassing is fairly often used because it s a convenient method for re-use technical inherited

366846
ironruby	ironpython
if you re not beholden to javascript for now i d check out ironpython - the hosting api is identical to what microsoft will release for js and about as easy as it could possibly be and switching between the 3 dlr languages ipy ironruby and managed js is trivial

366854
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that when i close the dialog box and then i click on the link that triggers it it does not pop-up again unless i refresh the page

366927
drwatson	minidump
if you just want to capture crashes then ignore all errors and let drwatson generate a minidump for you

366940
fast-forward	merge
a series of recursive merge would look like this note that the first merge was a fast-forward as i didn t force recursion

366955
std	ostream	cout	ofstream
how do i bind a std ostream to either std cout or to an std ofstream object depending on a certain program condition

366983
kde	gnome
it s simply a lot of little user interface differences making life hard for the newcomer similar to moving from windows to gnome or from gnome to kde

367014
perl	tcl
perl is one of the earliest of the next generation of scripting languages tcl tk can probably claim primacy

367049
i2c	spi
as for sensors all of these support i2c and spi interfaces so the number of peripherals available is well into the thousands

367091
verilog	vhdl
if you decide you want to explore hardware design the nexys 2 board from digilent is an excellent way to learn about hardware design using vhdl or verilog

367096
crossover	mutation
breed new generation through crossover and or mutation genetic

367096
crossover	mutation
the key is the reproduction part which could happen sexually or asexually using genetic operators crossover and mutation

367099
reportlab	pyx
get pyx or reportlab and create a pdf that prints properly

367116
rss	feed
with rss feed how do you set up google analytics or any other statistical tracker to track people who are subscribed to the feed

367118
put	get
if you have a breakpoint in a hot spot that gets hit too often before you get to the problem deactivate it and put another one in a place you know will be hit shortly before the problem manifests then activte the one in the hot spot

367155
punctuation	words
i m trying to split a string up into words and punctuation adding the punctuation to the list produced by the split

367155
punctuation	words
so i want the string split at whitespace with the punctuation split from the words

367159
super	implements
to me the best approach was to first implements this super simple example and play with it

367192
getter	setter
i know java and would normally put in getter setter methods

367302
bazaar	git
i believe the commands are exactly the same for mercurial with hg instead of git and very similar for bazaar darcs monotone codeville arch and most other dvcss

367303
inline	inlining
the compiler inlining is sophisticated enough to only inline if this will help in the optimization stratergy being used

367335
versioning	upgrade
versioning number is also needed for the users to know if they can upgrade

367387
versioning	upgrade
this code is more for an example and in this example below it is checking to see if the versioning of notepad.exe needs to be upgrade that means the versioning stored in the property table value notepad_verson is greater than the versioning of notepad.exe on the system

367396
inherited	subclassing
in a language like java or c++ which conflate subtyping with inherited your use of polymorphism may be restricted to subclassing of a particular class

367409
folder	directory
that way you only have one folder on the main directory and it stays unclutered

367461
superclass	subclassing
the problem would still exist if i had answer_b be the superclass - and have answer_a subclassing or compose it

367500
integer	unsigned
most often an rgb color is stored in a structure or unsigned integer with blue occupying the least significant area a byte in 32-bit and 24-bit formats green the second least and red the third least

367503
vb6	vba
any book on excel vba should help as you can copy and paste code from vba to vb6

367503
vb6	vba
also trying to do what you want to do in excel with vba then putting it into your vb6 project will also help

367538
int	double
by the way in this example the amount is an abstraction of a real life concept that could also be represented as a double or an int but maybe we have interestion methods inside that would be better if set in its own class

367563
ienumerable	ilist
linfu.ioc supports ienumerable t and ilist t injection for constructors properties methods and even fields all right out of the box

367607
implements	extends
hey i m extends some wpf controls and need to implements some custom events

367782
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you might also want to look at the viewdidload viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods that are triggered well it s fairly obvious when

367790
width	text-align
the second suggestion is to remove the float and width from the div and instead rely on the text-align right

367828
inherited	properties
i ve used table-per-hierarchy inherited so i added a new entity for the premium user and map it to the user entity with conditions to ispremiumuser properties

367899
cassini	iis
incidentally this is one of the reasons i habitually run my vs webapp projects through iis not cassini anymore

367959
floating-point	integer	integer	unsigned
states that unsigned integer color components when specified are linearly mapped to floating-point values such that the largest representable value maps to 1.0 full intensity and 0 maps to 0.0 zero intensity .

368176
min	max
i know the max and min values

368201
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch in the main function hides the exception-handling from debugger

368224
pyopengl	pyglet
edit i wasn t aware that the pyglet opengl api is different from the pyopengl one

368291
fadein	fadeout
because chrome can t display well png24 with opacity change i tried to do a fadein fadeout with jquery on a png image and i get an annoying white flash before image animation

368337
post	get
also consider the order gpc get post cookie on which the _request will get filled

368367
vb.net	vb6
if you maintaining a vb6 or vb.net application over the long term i strongly recommend that you minimize the use of 3rd party controls

368415
directx	gdi
wpf uses directx for rendering which is much faster instead of the native windows gdi

368457
equals	gethashcode
if you have a different but similar-for-the-purposes-of-equality object to compare to then you ll need to implement your own gethashcode equals and ideally

368461
post	get
there is or should be a semantic difference between a get request and a post request

368466
directx	gdi
to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics

368636
debian	linux
i m mainly concerned with debian linux but deb packages are not an option for the reasons ian bicking outlines here

368653
opera	firefox
copy this code in a jsp page testpage.jsp deploy this file in an existing context of a web application on the server i use apache tomcat then open a browser firefox ie7 or opera using the correct url localhost context1 testpage.jsp type your name in the input and submit the form

368655
client-side	server-side
you should create an api using objects and then create a web service interface around that api for java you would use java2wsdl on your interface and then wsdl2java to create a skeleton server-side implementation or client-side implementation i m sure that an equivalent methodology exists in wcf that all the other systems can query

368700
profiling	debugging
i found that it was much easier for me to develop code in eclipse compile it with ant using etaras rapc ant tasks but they seem to be gone -- blackberry ant tools seem to be a suitable replacement and use the jde for debugging profiling etc

368729
versioning	upgrade
if your shared components are tagged often enough then your colleagues are probably right and it s easier to manage the incremental changes from the most recent tag to the trunk than it is to manage the change from arbitrary versioning x determined at the last build to arbitrary versioning y determined when you choose to upgrade

368738
filesystems	ntfs
it looks like the ntfs filesystems could be improved with a better path caching implementation but clearly the gem tool could implement the caching itself and have its performance not so dependent on the platform

368757
post	get
requests that produce side effects should be post for semantic reasons and also because of basic csrf stuff a false img tag can hit any get endpoint without a user even knowing

368759
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
i prefer the argumentnullexception over the nullreferenceexception that not checking the argument would provide

368768
apache-poi	jxls
if you code for java 1.5 you try jxls what extends apache-poi and use xml xslt technologies

368813
post	get
the only problem is that disabled html form inputs don t get included in the post get data

368813
post	get
what s the best way to emulate the readonly attribute for a select tag and still get the post data

368822
post	get
to re-enable it before submission so that get post data is included

368842
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested and working in ie 6 7 8b2 firefox 2 3 opera 9.62 safari 3.2.1 for windows and google-chrome

368882
stdout	stderr
the nul 2 1 redirects stdout and stderr to nul so nothing from pslist will be displayed

368888
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
the other potential exceptions that come to mind are argumentexception or argumentnullexception but these have a connotation of being related to parameters that are passed into the method and are not therefore appropriate to my mind

368902
inherited	properties
is there a class i can inherited from that gives me the application properties as in the view so i could to this

368956
post	get
i have forms in my page a get and a post and i want add pager on my get form

368976
free	malloc
i am under the impression that it s not good practice to mix new and delete with malloc and free

368998
post	put
edit you should probably also put the quoted part into the question as it isn t entirely clear from the original post

369003
pop-up	dialog
from the pop-up dialog you can decide what to clear

369009
inherited	properties
one of my favorite approaches is to take one of the built-in methods inherited from the object superclass replace it with a custom function passthrough and attach properties to that function object

369020
cvs	svn
they basically specialize in both cvs and now svn hosting

369026
mousemove	keydown
the context is the main window is a light-box-like system except instead of pictures it shows iframes and each iframe is an interactive page with keydown mousemove handlers

369036
put	get
in order to get something useful accomplished we need to put a real statement in so we get a slice of each pair which removes the single quotes and closing square bracket then further split on that conveniently-placed opening square bracket

369037
swt	swing
i use swt jface instead of swing for the native look and feel primarily.

369076
pull	push
git differentiates between commit and push pull so working offline works great

369101
bazaar	git
you re looking for a distributed revision control system such as git bazaar or mercurial

369102
post	get
i have a modelbinder setup that is able to build a messageobject from get and post parameters but i m not sure how i can reverse the process

369133
versioning	upgrade
keep in mind you need to use mysql 5.1.6 or newer to do this if not time to upgrade there s been some noteworthy speed improvements in the new versioning anyway

369150
rpm	yum
php 4 was built from a source rpm outside of yum s control

369221
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython ironruby

369254
fflush	gets
you should probably test that it gets fflush on exit to be sure

369266
entity-relationship	diagram
i tried using toad to create an entity-relationship diagram but after leaving it running for 48 hours straight it still hadn t produced anything visible and i needed my computer back

369350
postgresql	mysql
ea supports oracle mysql sql server multiple versions postgresql interbase db2 and access in one fell swoop

369354
erd	diagram
a single erd or set of erd s are not sufficient to document a system of this complexity any more than a class diagram would be adequate to document an oo system

369379
entity-relationship	diagram
in my experience entity-relationship or uml diagram aren t the most useful artifact - with a large number of tables diagram especially reverse engineered ones are often a big convoluted mess that nobody learns anything from

369391
yacc	bison
if you don t know any i ve done my google search... yacc bison is the only way

369413
min	max
if you really need to exclude null from the result and you can t prevent it from being in your array then maybe you should just iterate through the array with a simple loop and keep track of the min and max in separate variables

369413
min	max
you can still use the compare method on each object to compare it with your current min and max values

369443
yacc	bison
none of them are in python but i should think that starting from xblite might be more helpful than starting from yacc bison ply

369469
folder	directory
unfortunately in my application we do not have a finite or known set of upload target directory -- any share or folder in the network may be accessible

369605
inherited	properties
it doesn t matter where the properties comes from in the inherited chain

369605
inherited	properties
in short don t think of the states properties as mx states because the mx prefix of a properties is merely inherited from the component

369689
folder	directory
when i look at the directory in set working folder it seems to be ok

369741
public	protected
things like making sure that public and protected methods are documented prior to check-in to making sure that no work can be checked in without a corresponding work item

369766
put	get
can you at least get the users to put the company names into multiple text boxes

369779
entity-relationship	diagram
well a picture tells a thousand words so i would recommend creating entity-relationship diagram where you can view the relationship between tables at a glance something that is hard to do with a text-only description

369794
rss	feed
i ve seen a few examples of rss feed in asp.net mvc like this and some samples in projects like oxite but none of them are complete

369834
filtering	grouping
with soundex you can store a pre-calculated soundex in your table and compare sort grouping filtering on that

369837
tunnel	vpn
the problem arises only when i connect to the server through a vpn tunnel

369878
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
a quick test shows that ie 6 reveals 27 items from a 27 item list safari for windows 3.2.1 reveals 22 firefox 2 reveals 20 and opera 9.6.2 reveals 16

369955
integer	unsigned
but a deliberate implementation choice of most vanilla graphics libraries is that they treat colours as unsigned 32-bit integers internally with the three or four as alpha is typically included components packed into the integer

369955
cpu	processors
remember that bitmaps are usually accessed by more parts of the hardware than your processors and the endian that is specified by say conventional display adapters is not necessarily the same as the endian of your cpu

370007
post	get
further to jimmy s post you can also use a hex-ascii translator to get this

370010
fiddler	charles
sure there are many tools such as charles fiddler 2 and firebug that allow you to do this via an interface but i d like to be able to automatically generate reports and the like based on this tool

370014
rss	feed
i am currently using it for atom feed but it is supposed to work for rss as well

370046
rsa	aes
i m looking at using rsa and aes exactly the same way gpg and pgp work

in general i would name the button differently unless they are part of a radio checkbox set

370076
serializable	deserialization
are you trying to only prevent deserialization of the salesperson while still being able to serializable the xml representation of the salesperson represented by the stream

370143
uiview	subviews
when you want one particular view shown simply add it as a subviews to that previously pushed uiview

370163
g++	gcc
if by understanding memory management in mingw g++ you mean understand how the mingw g++ compiler handles memory internally while it is compiling files such as when it allocates and frees abstract syntax tree nodes etc. then your answer is that as a multi-pass compiler gcc may not know the optimal lifetime for any particular piece of data but it does know that large groups of objects won t be needed from one pass to the other so it uses memory pools when possible and garbage collection elsewhere

370184
disk	ram
depending on the size of the data and the amount of ram available one of the best performance gains will occur by setting sqlite to use an all-in-memory database rather than writing to disk

370195
free	malloc
do malloc new and free delete work in the same way with regard to this

370199
int	chars
the 4 bytes contain the number of the chars in the unicode tables as a 4-byte int

370283
int	double
however it will happily allow a variation where the double is changed to an int unsigned or any integral type

370283
int	double
why would the c++ designer s allow me to static const an int or unsigned but not a double

370293
int	double
i don t know why it would treat a double different from an int

370311
int	double
using g++ with no optimization -o0 it automatically inlines constant int variables but not constant double values

370314
freebsd	aix	freebsd	solaris	solaris	aix
btw i ve spent a considerable amount of time on aix solaris freebsd and linux.

370346
switching	screens
- dynamic pages one silverlight screens can switching between screens like a normal app

370378
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i get exception setting a property that only has a getter ie gives error google-chrome gives error but in opera it works if i assign it on the element not the prototype

370378
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
you can however add a new function will work in firefox google-chrome and opera but not in ie since ie don t have the constructor property

370392
post	get
the primary most important aspect of this is don t trust that the input to your post get handlers will come from the forms you design

370409
icomparer	comparable
this example does not use the icomparer version of the orderby extension but relies on the fact the doubles are comparable already and returns the calcvalue assumed as double as the key

370501
cpu	affinity
taking cpu affinity into account will such an environment be useful with threading

370515
folder	directory
i saw the biggest performance improvements when i copied the templates folder from the jar to the root web directory for the webapp

370572
mouse	keyboard
i expect it works like you described with a message loop that handles mouse and keyboard messages for the popup menu

370580
cpu	affinity
when you say taking cpu affinity into account - are you saying that all processes have cpu affinity in this hypothetical system

370598
sproutcore	cappuccino
i m about to build a web app and i would like to use either sproutcore or cappuccino

370710
post	get
apologies for the long post but i wonder if i could get some more eyeballs on this before i submit a bug report to sun

370722
move	drag
i have textarea and i have set only verticle scrollbar to that textarea.i m appending data for every 1 minute to textarea problem is when new data appends to the textarea scrollbar will move up.to see the new data every time i have to drag the scroll bar that is not the requirment.i want scrollbar should not move up it should move down how can i do this

370754
keydown	keyup
it only supplies the keyup and keydown events containing the keyeventargs structure

370778
vim	emacs
emacs with the psgml module can do it along with vim but both probably more low-lovel

370863
packets	multicast
packets on your multicast port

370863
packets	multicast
multicast packets on that port

370863
packets	multicast
inaddr_any to receive only multicast packets sent to

370881
uninstall	upgrade
the old upgrade was more an uninstall and a reinstall

370933
post	get
for wpf that works because you can t call the method by a get post request.

370933
hide	show
for the web you should make something more sophisticated not just hide show the button.

370937
datatrigger	eventtrigger
it s public because it s used as a base class for the triggers that ship with wpf trigger multitrigger eventtrigger datatrigger etc

370940
uninstall	upgrade
addendum thanks to divo s probing while the simplest hack that could possibly work is to say if install step is called its an upgrade call the uninstall step for the service first i d like a proper officially blessed answer

370948
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
using a simple version control software like svn git or bazaar is not exactly what i want

371069
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen the same issue with ie 8 the issues does not occur in firefox google-chrome or ie 6

371106
postgresql	mysql
you might want to migrate the data from access to a database backend - mssql if your institution already has a license or mysql or postgresql if you have a budget of zero

371189
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if you are writing custom collections anyway you can implement the inotifycollectionchanged or the inotifypropertychanged interfaces

371199
rss	feed
uc berkley has a couple of computer science courses online for free as mp3 and video files including rss feed for each course

371218
integer	unsigned
in this example i could use an unsigned integer but that is non cls compliant i beleive

371241
3des	aes	rsa	aes	rsa	3des
i have used openssl in past and found it a great library for crypto apis including aes rsa 3des

371243
csc	vbc
not without rewriting csc or vbc

371257
width	height
i am not sure if this is what you mean but an often seen blur-like effect is created by creating a full height full width div-element with a background-color and opacity property set

371264
folder	directory
for example this should set up a virtual directory called testdir that points to the folder c inetpub wwwroot test

371300
inherited	subclassing
i m using nhibernate 2.0.1 and a table per subclassing inherited mapping strategy.

371348
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method should reflect the equals logic

371348
equals	gethashcode
if two things are equals then they must return the same value for gethashcode

371348
equals	gethashcode
if the gethashcode is equals it is not necessary for them to be the same

371348
equals	gethashcode
oh - for convenience you might also consider providing and operators when overriding equals and gethashcode

371390
post	get
i ve marked this post as community wiki so i won t get any reputation from it

371420
jdom	dom4j
it s a java xpath implementation used for both jdom and dom4j

371462
pdfsharp	migradoc
we used a set of third party dlls from pdfsharp who in turn use dlls from migradoc

371465
octree	quadtree
how would i write a basic but complete quadtree class or octree in c++

371468
draggable	droppable
i m using jquery ui s draggable and droppable libraries in a simple asp.net proof of concept application

371468
draggable	droppable
when the page posts back partially updating the updatepanel s content i rebind the draggable and droppable

371470
bash	zsh
i d spend more effort learning posix sh as a start and then head towards bash or zsh

371490
put	get
get the first character after that comma and put it in front of the string

371547
post	get
in the same way as pre-increment it is probably best to implement post increment in terms of pre-increment so that you get the same behavior

371576
rss	feed
i highly recommend subscribing to his rss feed

371640
mouse	keyboard
my wrists only hurt when i m doing stuff that requires me to move my hand off the keyboard and onto the mouse or arrow keys and back constantly

371647
ironruby	ironpython
also no use to you but microsoft are going to be releasing ironruby studio and ironpython studio at some point in the future

371653
children	parent
i have the following class with a list of parent and children to be persisted in a hierarchy table

371653
children	parent
is there any solution to this other than persisting parent hierarchy and children hierarchy in separate tables

371668
doc	rtf
then i can determine if they need to be in pdf rtf doc or even converted to html

371703
nullreferenceexception	targetinvocationexception
when i call removeeventhandler with the same arguments as the installeventhandler call the last line throws a targetinvocationexception with an inner exception of nullreferenceexception

371713
folder	directory
this basically says if the url doesn t lead to a directory that exists or a file then go through my index.php also block out the logs library application and config folder because sometimes they are in the document root on some of my projects because of server limitations

371721
apache	lighttpd
a few have suggested using lighttpd over apache

371743
octree	quadtree
the reason to use a quadtree is because you can then split on x- and y-coordinates an octree on x y and z making collision detection trivial

371793
rss	feed
in rss feed for example you should have a guid for each item in the feed

371808
uicontrol	uibutton
interestingly corresponding classes like uibutton uicontrol don t use this idiom

371821
apache	lighttpd
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache

371855
put	get
easiest way round it is to put event unsubscriptions in the observer s dispose method and remember to call it when you get rid of the observer

371855
children	parent
the parent observer always knows about its children so can call properties and methods on them directly if it needs to

371855
children	parent
the children publishers should know nothing about their parent

371855
children	parent
communication between children is then routed via a common parent events on the way up method calls on the way down

371868
subnet	packets
in this case the scheme has worked pretty well and even if a manufacturer screws up and issues cards with duplicate mac addresses things will still work ok as long as those cards are not on the same subnet since beyond a subnet only the ip address is used to route packets

371921
post	get
this is a web interface so i already know that i need to check the incoming post get for permissions and handle errors there anyway

371944
cumsum	accumarray
use built-in functions like sum cumsum diff bsxfun and accumarray to operate directly over the image matrix

371947
filtering	grouping
given that i have a valid directoryentry object for both the grouping i want to test and the account i want to check for i need a directorysearcher filtering string that will allow me to confirm that the account is in that grouping even if the account is a foreignsecurityprincipal

371982
accessor	properties
i had 2 problems upgrading from 5.0.15 to 5.0.17 one is that any fields marked as properties must not have any accessor

371982
accessor	properties
if you have an accessor for a properties field you must remove the properties tag and implement both accessor if you need them

372005
cvs	svn
i use this to invoke tortoise cvs svn functions to open a command prompt in the corresponding directory etc

372017
indesign	framemaker
page layout software started with pagemaker and the other main players in this space were its competitor quark xpess and now indesign with which adobe is essentially trying to deprecate and replace it and framemaker

372017
indesign	framemaker
framemaker would be the obvious choice if adobe didn t keep giving off signals that they are trying to deprecate it and move its user base to indesign

372017
indesign	framemaker
framemaker indesign ventura quicksilver arbortext and presumably the madcap products all come with facilities to do pre-press preparation

372049
jax-ws	jax-rs
i think the best thing about it is it s integration with newer technologies like jax-ws and jax-rs jsr 311 restful spec

372068
installation	upgrade
ask yourself this will the developers be more effective and will their increased productivity actually increase benefit to the company or reduce corporate costs once you ve considered the upgrade transition installation on the servers additional testing etc

372121
superclass	subclassing
this uses a kind of abstract superclass with mixins to create concrete subclassing that are disjoint

372140
regasm	regsvr32
do i use regasm or regsvr32 to register it

372152
strcpy	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strcmp
although you link to the php manual the strspn function comes from c libraries along with strlen strcpy strcmp etc

372198
int	double
i have two processes one will query other for data.there will be huge amount of queries in a limited time 10000 per second and data 100 mb will be transferred per second.type of data will be an integral type double int

372207
boost	allocator
i previously used localhost network programming to do that and used manual shared memory allocator before i knew about boost

372227
rss	feed
a lot of the tools we use svn mantis have rss feed that i was thinking to render

372273
paradox	bde
- community site about paradox and bde

372277
content-length	content-type
writing a plain cgi app isn t difficult just output your headers especially content-type and preferably content-length if you know it and then just output the page

372279
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i did a little experiment and it turns out that yes javascript is handled specially by ie but definitely not so by firefox safari opera or google-chrome

372291
mbunit	nunit
ok so i keep seeing how vs2008 has this nice unit test display and i can see people running nunit tests within it on dimecasts.net and this article seems to imply that mbunit v3 should have support for using visual studio s test runner

372333
opera	google-chrome
2016 update accessing the filesystem directly is possible via the filesystem api which is only supported by google-chrome and opera and may end up not being implemented by other browsers with the exception of edge

372414
inherited	properties
it shows the equivalence of a function which inherited its prototype but uses this to fill in a new object s properties and a function object that uses a specific prototype

372418
rss	feed
if you know xslt and understand the contents of your rss feed that s about 2-3 hours of work tops

372423
stdout	stderr
useful because you can feed the command input and get back both stderr and stdout separately

372455
moq	typemock
you want to use the interface so as to make the class wrapper swappable during testing using rhino mocks moq or typemock

372537
portrait	landscape
for the life of me i can t figure out how i m supposed to set the uitextfield to display the text vertically landscape mode instead of horizontally portrait mode

372589
post	get
i hope somebody can give me some insight or maybe in the future somebody get inspired by this humble post

372647
int	chars
only local primitive variables int chars and references to objects reside in stack

372691
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i m trying to submit a form who is rendered in a simplemodal dialog but my submit is never called when i m using ff3 opera google-chrome safari and ie works

372700
boost	stl
i notice that get set is not the c++ way as far as i can tell by looking at boost stl and even reading the writings of some of the top c++ experts

372700
getter	setter
c++ killed the getter setter

372737
cvs	svn
popular revision control systems like cvs and svn use text-based diff tools behind the scenes

372740
getter	setter
i tend to have getter and setter i just don t tend to call them getx and setx usually i ll do something like this for example

372742
pop-up	dialog
i thought about putting this in a try catch loop but i d rather do a test and then pop-up a dialog saying can t access smtp or something like that

372747
emacs	textmate
does anybody know if there is a color theme like the textmate dawn theme for emacs

372757
boost	stl
the stl and boost which was influenced by the stl just chose one design -- it s perfectly fine to have a different design for your classes

372760
gridview	sqldatasource
for example in webforms you can embed a sqldatasource with selection logic directly in your mark up and tie it to a gridview

372760
post	get
in webforms one typically sees only get post methods being used

372787
getter	setter
for most objects you will want to have getter and setter but you should always consider how the object will actually be used when you write them

372787
boost	stl	getter	setter
boost and stl are full of getter and setter they just do not use the names get and set instead they use names like length end reserve capacity etc

372787
getter	setter
your getter and setter should do the same

372798
disk	ram
in mid-2007 these machines with 4 or 8gb of ram and 5x 10k or 15k scsi disk cost between â 1 500-â 2 000 to buy

372800
getter	setter
i only use getter setter when there is no alternative

372810
getter	setter
c did t even have the possibility of getter setter so there was a habit of using direct access to members as in a struct

372810
getter	setter
c c++ have always favored speed and if there was any possibility of an old compiler that wouldn t properly inline a getter setter would have a speed penalty

372821
x86	64bit
note that this behavior can t be observed with double values on common processor as most x86 instructions have a version working with 64bit chunks such as movl

372836
post	get
post goes to the service get goes to the documenter and that returns html documentation

372981
ant	maven
i did not find any instances of things i needed to do that i couldn t do with ant and needed maven for

372983
post	get
i d say that soap processing generating query sending it get it processed then getting answer back may be more resource intensive than just a post even multithreaded

372983
profiling	benchmarking
profiling or benchmarking is probably the only way to be sure anyway

372984
put	get
so you could put up a google map allow a click to set drag a marker and then use the webservice to get the timezone offset

373051
equals	gethashcode
if your list contains objects you ve created overriding gethashcode and equals will help you out

373054
implements	extends
for example do i make a person object that contains the persongateway object and then write wrapper functions that pass calls to the gateway object or do i write the person object to extends the persongateway object and then only implements the specific functions that i need

373058
post	get
http get is semantically meant to be used to fetch a page while post can be argued that when used you d expect that some kind of state is changed

373058
post	get
for example there s an expectation that using get with the same parameters multiple times yield the same results while using post they may not

373058
post	get
i think the ruby on rails ajax libraries used get instead of post and lead to a lot of data being lost when being touched upon by web spiders

373058
post	get
you should know the purposes of what the page does and decide on how to answer a get request and how to answer a post request

373075
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox would be my first two choices

373099
pem	pkcs#12
i m having trouble figuring out what pem and pkcs#12 and all these things do differently from each other

373099
pem	pkcs#12
in a pem file the certificates and keys are base64 encoded and placed within some text delimiters a pkcs#12 file uses a binary encoding named asn.1 to structure the file - you can think of asn.1 as a binary form of xml

373099
pem	pkcs#12
openssl works best with pem while most browsers and emailapplications will expect pkcs#12 but you can freely convert between the formats

373106
folder	directory
anyway the virtual directory en fr and es are inside their respective country physical folder

373261
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade to the latest 64bit drivers versioning 177.82 release date nov 12 2008 and the result is the exact same

373302
spaces	delimiter
then the following xpath expression in the test attribute of either or evaluates to true exactly when the value of domain is one of the delimiter values in the string we use a spaces for delimiter in this concrete example

373304
cassini	iis
cassini if you can use iis instead of vs s integrated web server aka cassini

373451
mouse	keyboard
if the menus are triggered through keyboard action the accelerators should be shown but if triggered by the mouse the accelerators are intentionally not shown

373615
button	checkbox
view a gmaps ui with markers and polylines plus checkbox and button and vertex details and edge details divs

373615
button	checkbox
js functions that update the model when events on the checkbox and button fire

373665
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested in google-chrome do i need to test in safari

373669
google-chrome	safari
i have noticed some of the default fonts are smaller on safari then google-chrome also google-chrome uses the v8 javascript engine which has caused some people problems especially if you have a lot of form logic

373672
google-chrome	safari
simply google-chrome and safari have a lot of different features in their implementations and safari is pretty widely used

373674
mouse	keyboard
assuming that the course s software runs on windows there may be some that need to cover the basics of a computer what is a hard drive keyboard mouse monitor cpu motherboard etc

373679
google-chrome	safari
i ve noticed safari handles asian characters better than google-chrome

373679
google-chrome	safari
also google-chrome and safari rely on the same webkit for rendering pages but their javascript engines are totally different so if you use javascript in your pages you need to check both

373682
google-chrome	safari
yes safari and google-chrome even though they are using webkit the two versions of webkit that are being used are significantly different

373684
google-chrome	safari
safari uses mac fonts but google-chrome would use windows fonts

373684
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve noticed that there can sometimes be problems where using a font like arial it shows up fine in firefox google-chrome ie but on safari it can cause a line to wrap because the font is slightly bigger

373708
disk	ram
my choice would be probably based on the low write volume and it s a web app to scale up and stuff as much ram as i could in the db server with separate disk paths for the data and log files of the database

373730
g++	gcc
under gcc g++ have you looked at ccache

373776
google-chrome	firefox
windows firefox or google-chrome all monitor usage statistics and analyze the crash reports are sent to them

373780
freebsd	linux
many versions of sed often provide an option like -r gnu linux and -e freebsd that allows you to use modern-style regular expressions

373805
hash	salt
append the salt to the password and compute its cryptographic hash

373830
getter	setter
in summary each approach has certain perks that may be useful depending on the scenario field access allows readonly getter no need for setter property access works when nothing special is required from your poco and seems to be the defacto approach

373856
onkeyup	onkeydown
i have tried onkeypress onkeydown and onkeyup in the datagridviewcell but they never get called

373923
ada	pascal
this language family includes pascal and its descendants in the modula ada and clu families

373923
haskell	scheme
in languages where lambda is common such as haskell ml caml and scheme a great deal of effort has been expended making allocation blindingly fast

373923
haskell	scheme
especially in ml caml scheme haskell even anonymous functions are dirt cheap ---use lots of them

373935
versioning	upgrade	jdom	xerces
forget about proprietary apis such as jdom or apache ones xerces xmlserializer because will tie you to a specific implementation that can evolve in time or lose backwards compatibility which will make you change your code in the future when you want to upgrade to a new versioning of jdom or whatever parser you use

373972
ssl	https
but you may also want to consider making a constant define if you know this value won t change i sometimes change these values later in a site wide configuration file for example if i have an https ssl certificate for the website

373975
mouse	keyboard
you have the basic building tools right there - you can intercept all mouse events and nearly all keyboard events

373979
bash	tcsh
but the shell tcsh bash will assign that filename including its spaces to a single argument of tar

373983
rtp	rtcp	rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp	rtcp	sdp
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.

373985
pop-up	dialog
i ve set up my server and my certificate successfully but due to me being cheap and not paying a certified ssl signer ie pop-up an annoying dialog about not being a valid certificate

373985
pop-up	dialog
so what i am wondering is how to make it so that ie does not pop-up a dialog saying that my certificate isn t signed by a reliable authority without visiting physically each computer

374010
client-side	server-side
server-side filtering validations is important for security while client-side validation and interactivity is important for usability

374028
versioning	upgrade
i modified the code and put it in the startup of my apps and have it check for versioning difference and upgrade automatically

374189
ssl	https
it s my first time working with smartcards digital certificates activex ssl and https

374189
ssl	https
i ve managed to work with de ssl and https smartcards ok digital certificates ok activex x also ok

374219
client-side	server-side
we are actually building two applications - server-side rails application to handle the data and expose them through json api and a client-side ext application that uses this api

374282
public	protected
i still can t figure out how to cleanly make some of these mixin methods private or protected though only the display and number_of_displays method should be included as public methods

374296
nexus	artifactory
i don t know about artifactory but here are my reasons for using nexus

374296
rss	feed
provides you with rss feed of recently installed broken artifacts and errors

374303
getter	setter
i am rewriting a project so that it uses getter and setter to reference the tixmlelement s

374303
getter	setter
or if you have succesfully implemented getter setter wrappers for tixmlelement s let me know how i can as well

374318
int	double	16-bit	64bit
i need to convert unicode strings in python to other types such as unsigned and signed int 8 bits unsigned and signed int 16-bit unsigned and signed int 32 bits unsigned and signed int 64bit double float string unsigned and signed 8 bit unsigned and signed 16 bit unsigned and signed 32 bit unsigned and signed 64bit

374542
rss	feed
see this article for an example creating an rss feed

374565
lxml	elementtree
you should also check for lxml which is compatible with elementtree and has full xpath support

swt	swing
there is jtoaster for swing but i wonder if there isn t any other implementation based on swt

374642
firefox	safari
- it happens in firefox and safari

versioning	upgrade
what are the reasons for hanging on to the old versioning when they should be compatible and how can you convince people to upgrade

374763
getter	setter
in python properties are used instead of the java-style getter setter

374763
getter	setter
but in cases were a property is not appropriate one might still end up with methods that behave like getter or setter

374885
post	get
i m looking into a restful design and would like to use the http methods post get ... and http headers as much as possible

374927
free	malloc
you can set it to check the integrity of the heap on each call to malloc or free

374965
int	boolean
although boolean has only two values it is actually stored using 32 bits like an int

375031
coldfusion	railo
coldfusion 8 added a number of exclusive features that haven t been added to the other engines and vice-versa with railo and openbd

375037
getter	setter
you won t ever loose the chance to make your property behave like a getter setter later by using descriptors

375037
getter	setter
so my advice is to avoid getter setter unless the project you are working on already uses them because you can always change your mind later and make properties read-only write-only or whatever without modifying the interface to your class

375052
midi	osc
when an audio or midi clip is played triggered its name needs to be sent using osc to another application

375143
mouse	keyboard
usually this type of thing starts off pretty simple and gets a bit complex once you start handling caching paging selection mouse and keyboard input and so on

375149
children	parent
this tells the vbox to ignore it s children s measurements when sizing itself and calculate its height instead based on it s own it s parent constraints

375160
getter	setter
if the getter setter is any more complex than that i would use get_x and set_x

375165
move	drag
so far i have drag and drop functionality where the item is visually attached to the mouse and can be move to a drop target

375242
for-loop	loops
or you could iterate over them with a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

375302
hide	show
you could add some javascript in the usercontrol to test whether window.opener is non-null and on that basis hide or show the close page ui

375310
post	get
edit so i just found out that get methods indeed work but post methods however do not work

375310
apache	nginx
my backend works fine on apache but i had to install a module working with nginx lib-www

375310
post	get
it now works but for some reason post get methods don t work..

375320
firefox	safari
also i am doing my development in firefox i just posted the screenshot from safari

the presenter or the controller depending if you do mvc or mvp should know about it not the domain the domain will assert defensive coding is as all needed values ok or throw an exception not ask for it

375545
pop-up	dialog
you don t pop-up a new dialog

375547
hiawatha	apache
i m trying to set up a light development environment to allow straight cgi in common lisp and i d like to use hiawatha instead of the much larger apache

375547
hiawatha	apache	post	get
i have code that works for both get and post in apache but only get in hiawatha

375547
hiawatha	apache
is there a difference in the way apache and hiawatha handle post

375555
post	get
the cgi specification only specifies that post data should be sent to a cgi script using the program s stdin as opposed to get which is sent in the environment variable query_string

375569
post	get
i get this error when i try that which i assume is because there s no enctype multipart form-data like i mention not wanting to have to do in my original post

375603
getter	setter
we were constantly writing wrappers in getter setter for date and time either we would store it as joda time and one set of getter setter passed it through and the other would convert on the fly and some classes stored it internally as a java date time and the joda getter setter had to switch it on the fly

375647
boost	stl
does the stl or std library or even boost have any cases where certain includes must come in a certain order

375658
boost	stl
as far as boost and the stl i m pretty sure i haven t encountered this situation yet

375661
getter	setter
if i have to use a getter setter i like it this way

375662
boost	stl
does the stl or std library or even boost have any cases where certain includes must come in a certain order

375683
boost	stl
does the stl or std library or even boost have any cases where certain includes must come in a certain order

375693
memcpy	malloc
you can use memcpy which if i recall can be optimized to perform word copies if possible to copy to an aligned data structure something allocated on the stack or from malloc

375708
x86	64bit
i don t recall seeing an integer division instruction that handles 64bit for x86

375708
multiplying	division
it would multiplying 2 32-bit integers and split the results across 2 registers but not division as far as i recall

375734
relaxng	schematron
additionally it must satisfy a dtd or a schema an xml schema a relaxng schema schematron or other constraints to be valid

375739
superclass	subclassing
the workaround has been that you have to copy the implementation for the get method into the subclassing even if it does nothing differently from the superclass

375765
filtering	grouping
i have an application that uses datatables to perform grouping filtering and aggregation of data

375765
filtering	grouping
so my question is if linq can be used to perform the grouping filtering and aggregation of my data and if it can is the performance comparable to datatables or should i just hunker down and write my own algorithms to do it

375768
put	get
if i put a dblink in the name of the queue in the dequeue options i get an error

375784
width	height
all my silverlight user controls are set to auto height width

375794
hide	show
in your button click handlers you would need to 1 scroll the viewer and 2 check the new value of the horizontaloffset to see if you need to hide or show either of the button

375799
firefox	safari
about your edit mjpeg is supported by firefox and safari

375805
client-side	server-side
if you re more familiar with php than javascript or server-side scripting than client-side scripting i d also recommend you checkout xajax

375851
width	height
try removing the height and width properties in your control if you ve defined the internal xap s height and width correctly to scale you ve used auto then it should respect what dom boundaries it s contained within on the page

375864
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller too has some special nib-handling code so that it retains all the top-level objects in its nib when it loads so that they ll stick around as long as it does

375868
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and safari but not in ie

folder	directory
what i m trying to do is keep the .dll files i want my website to use in a higher level directory then the folder i have set as the web root in iis

375926
implements	sealed
i would make the class sealed possibly implements an interface which just has the value property

375930
valgrind	gprof	vtune	gprof
a few other buzzwords if gprof does not do the job for you valgrind intel vtune sun dtrace

375932
filtering	grouping
you d be better off letting your database handle grouping filtering and aggregation

375948
nlb	iis
iis has convenient pooling via a nlb such as f5 but has the app-pool recycle issue and the lag caused by iis spawning on first demand the app-pool domain etc in the first place

375996
int	double
i have two complex objects with string int double list and other home made data type objects of the same type

375996
equals	icomparable
note the object doesn t implement equals i have no control on that and doesn t implement icomparable

375999
hide	show
i d put the edit form in a user control and show hide it a la lightbox style

376006
folder	directory
can i use a virtual directory for my bin folder

376014
try-catch	exception-handling
but steven is correct every root method must have a try-catch block surrounding any code that could throw an exception-handling your service should never have an unhandled exception-handling

376020
equals	icomparable
what i d do is write a class that implements icomparable and has a ctor that takes an object of your desired class and includes your equals function

376065
google-chrome	safari
hopefully it ll render ok in google-chrome and safari

376069
google-chrome	firefox
test in one major non-ie browser firefox or google-chrome would be my suggestion

376071

i wan t to hide show menuitems in a contextmenu using some propery of databound object

376136
stdout	stdio
stdout is defined in stdio

376169
django	turbogears
i m not sure why you are against ror and php but you may also want to take a look at some of the python web frameworks 1 such as turbogears django zope etc

376172
stdout	fflush
you might not fflush the original stdout properly - losing information

376190
opera	firefox
my approach is to code for firefox opera and the other non microsoft browsers

376192
debian	linux
i am running openoffice 2.4 on debian linux

376211
google-chrome	safari
once your page is mostly done verify that it still looks good in safari and google-chrome also both highly-compliant browsers so you shouldn t have too much trouble then start fixing it for ie both 6 and 7

376221
poi-hssf	jexcelapi
i ve looked at xlwt and xlrd for python as well as jexcelapi and poi-hssf for java

376227
free	malloc
is probrably using the new allocated memory but if it isn t malloc could be failing with out you knowing untill it is derefrenced with the free

376316
versioning	upgrade
if it shows 3 then it has been upgrade to 1.5 that s the versioning of the updated fielsystem

376369
translation	localization
can i with asp.net resources localization translation strings to depend on one or other the english grammar in a easy way like i pass number 1 in my translation it return you have one car or with 0 2 and higher you have n cars

376419
awt	swing
this is not true for graphics swing awt however which tend to be unpredictable and not necessarily reproducible across different platforms

376427
getter	setter
ie even if the controller class implements the required functionality of setting up connectivities the users can still access setter getter functions in the the dto directly to set them up themselves.

376440
post	get
works just like a clicked download ie using get not post

376451
disk	ram
video conversion takes a lot of cpu and ram and storage takes a lot of disk space and bandwidth

376462
ienumerable	ienumerator
however with just ienumerable ienumerator there is no way to know for sure wether or not there are more if you use foreach

376486
post	get
you get the method not allowed error because the default http verb for the web service calls is post and when you just type the url in the web browser the verb is get

376486
post	get
to enable get instead of post decorate your operation with the following additional attribute

376531
post	get
what you would need to do is to get your program to send a https post request to that url and then you would need to parse the html that comes back to extract the results you are interested in

376653
lisp	prolog
in paip chapter 11 norvig solves the zebra puzzle using a prolog embedded in lisp

376673
short	base
in short the interface is more valuable than the base class but a base class might save a lot of time and reduce buggy interface implementations

376691
width	margin
make a note of the values for page width left margin right margin

376691
width	margin
to render in pdf correctly body width + left margin + right margin must be less than or equal to page width

376691
width	margin
remember body width + left margin + right margin page width

376695
globalization	localization
this will make other things easier in the future like localization globalization

376716
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it s pretty much because people who write and use interpreted-language tend to prefer ducktyping and people who develop and use compiled-language prefer strong explicit typing

376716
vb6	vba
classical visual basic vb6 vba etc. the same program could be written in vb and run with identical results and comparable speed either compiled or interpreted

376725
google-chrome	firefox
i m not encountering this on flock which is a firefox variant nor on google-chrome ie

376788
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
margin padding height and width will be your friends sometimes you need to specify these values to see the same thing on many browsers

376798
inherited	properties
i inherited an application which uses a java properties file to define configuration parameters such as database name

376803
nhibernate	entityspaces
i have looked at nhibernate and entityspaces and they both seem to work differently

376817
min	max
just put a max or min whichever you prefer on it

376858
awk	ksh
i can t live without it and it is gradually displacing my sh ksh awk and perl scripts.

376871
emacs	textmate
custom textmate bundle snippets textmate s bundle editor is superb even though textmate lacks some important vi and emacs capabilities like split buffers

376874
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this is my simple test code which works in firefox and safari but does not work in opera

376901
typedef	struct
any typedef involving distinct struct will work

376925
nscopying	nsmutablecopying
nscopying nsmutablecopying

376964
ami	rightscale
also you can signup for a developer free account on rightscale and you can test some of their ami and free scripts they are pretty impressive

376993
for-loop	arrays
if you want the value arrays to be zero-based change the for-loop to be 0 to n-1

377049
g++	gcc
instead of having xcode use gcc to build .c and .m files tell it to use g++ and your issues will be resolved

377101
min	max
it s also possible to do this in a branch-free way since min and max can be implemented as branch-free operations

377152
stdout	stderr	plink	prompt
one of the problems is that unison expects the password prompt to print to stderr but plink prints it to stdout and causes unison to be confused so i thought well should be simple enough hack my thru plink s code and make it print the prompt to stdout

377153
rowdatabound	onclientclick
in the rowdatabound onclientclick event handler its printing hi when i click on any row

377158
onmousedown	onmouseup
if you set the mouse cursor in the onmousedown and reset it in the onmouseup anything works fine

377262
haskell	ocaml	erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml
go for a different paradigm functionnal lisp haskell ocaml erlang scala etc

377265
free	malloc
use new and delete over malloc and free

377293
folder	directory
this tells git-daemon to serve up all projects inside the current directory which i assume is the project directory containing the .git folder

377303
snmp	mib
does anybody know a good tool to assist in the development of an snmp mib with correct formatting and syntax

377309
ninject	linfu
unlike ninject however linfu doesn t force you to write any binding code to wire up your dependencies together

377476
merb	ruby-on-rails
i ve seen ruby-on-rails and merb running under glassfish

377477
profiling	debugging
with adobe flex builder 3 im trying to do some profiling on swf files but the problem is that i can only do this on debugging swfs

377486
inherited	properties
i ve got a simple class that inherited from collection and adds a couple of properties

377486
ienumerable	icollection
i assume this is because of the special treatment that xmlserializer gives icollection and ienumerable objects

377494
ienumerable	ilist
both during serialization and in data-binding they will be ignored if the item looks like a collection ilist ienumerable etc - depending on the scenario

377506
int	double
for the third invocation of mymethod using objd why is the double overload being used when i am actually passing it an int

377513
jstl	taglib
i m getting the following error when i try to use the jstl xml taglib

377519
int	double
i d guess that when calling mymethod 5 5 could be a double or an int as well and double has higher priority

377533
base-class	subclassing
there is a precedence issue - the overridden method is defined in the base-class so for best method purposes the overload even with an implicit cast is preferable since it is defined in the most-specific type the subclassing

377636
mouseover	mouseout
ive got the problem that i dont know how to stop my function with mouseover and restart it with mouseout

377646
domxpath	domdocument
i would suggest that you use domdocument and domxpath rather than simplexml

377650
versioning	upgrade
my approach to this is to use sql patch files files containing the sql statements to upgrade the db schema data with a versioning number at the start of the filename

377666
versioning	upgrade
my approach to this is to use sql patch files files containing the sql statements to upgrade the db schema data with a versioning number at the start of the filename

377679
fadein	fadeout
i m not sure exactly what you want to happen with regards to your fadein and fadeout effects in your fadeengine however i can give you two pieces of advice

377747
post	get
if you use office 2007 on the client end then you will get some nice buttons like post to my blog etc

377793
public	protected
in order to compile it needs to be able to resolve everything in the public protected api

377794
firefox	safari
it will work fine in safari but not firefox

377794
firefox	safari
however it now stops working on both safari and firefox

377868
converter	multibinding
to provide an object instance to your converter you can use multibinding

377895
for-loop	loops
in both cases the type info for the object o is determined at compile time.in the second instance o is seen as being global to the for-loop and in the first instance the clever java compiler knows that o will have to be available for as long as loops lasts and hence will optimise the code in such a way that there wont be any respecification of o s type in each iteration

377898
versioning	upgrade
see if you can upgrade the driver to a new versioning

377950
integer	unsigned
typecast your signed integer to unsigned to halve the number of branches

377956
width	height
the video size width height ratio is 4 3 so in the case there are some other elements on the screen the video doesn t fill the whole area

377956
width	height
does anyone know if there is a way to fill the blank area the area not filled by status window and menu bar with video preview without changing the width height ratio overwrite a part of video preview with status bar and menu perhaps with changing the window styles flags or any other approach

377983
button	checkbox
that way if you decide to change to radio button or checkbox or a command-line interface later on only your ui code will change and not the database tables.

378009
vbscript	vb6
since the top answer here is in vb6 i thought i d add one here in vbscript since that s what the question is asking for -

378057
onmousemove	keydown	keydown	keyup
i get events like onmousemove onlbuttondown up dblclk but i don t get events like keyup keydown or mousewheel

378128
post	put
edit to put on my business hat if you add up the time spent waiting for builds + the time spent trying to speed them up may be enough to warrant upgrading or the vss add-on mentioned in another post already +1 d it

378137
getter	setter
then all getter and setter will access properties age

378155
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
all the modern web browsers google-chrome ie safari and firefox come to mind are all ipv6 aware

378161
jlabel	jprogressbar
so to implement this i thought it would be simple to just use a list of jpanels each with a jprogressbar and a jlabel each of which can just accept focus to determine if it and others are selected

378165
g++	gcc
you can view the result in gcc of the preprocessor substitutions with g++ -e -dreport test.cpp

378174
jtable	jlabel	jtable	jprogressbar	jlabel	jprogressbar
how about a jtable which you can set to allow multiple rows to be selected with an internal jpanel occupying the single cell in each row which contains a jprogressbar and a jlabel

378179
jlist	jtable
the standard way of doing this kind of things is to use jtable or jlist as a container

378208
sorting	filtering
in the bigger picture this method is being used by a service class which is then supposed to add filtering sorting and all that - and the point of all this is of course to separate things out a bit but also to allow easy transition to a different database or a different or m later on if that would be the desire

378259
int	double
how do you round a double down to the nearest int in vb .net

378266
vb.net	vb6
are we talking vb.net or vb6

378294
post	get
i understand that some amount of javascript is likely needed to get this done as i do not wish to actually perform the post with that amount of data if possible as asp .net does have an upper limit to the size of the request that it will service though i don t know what that is exactly

378307
versioning	upgrade
the advice i heard from one of the authors is to have a script that will upgrade the database from versioning to versioning rather than building up from scratch each time

378319
folder	directory
i frequently find myself with a folder open in windows wishing to have a command prompt open with the same working directory

378319
folder	directory
so what is the quickest way to open a command prompt with a working directory of the current windows explorer folder

378336
hash	salt
you can post all needed information if you include a salt hash field calculated from values of non-editable post fields

378336
hash	md5
the hash could be an md5 of

378356
vb.net	vb6
there were times i fired up vb6 vb.net later to work out some complex interaction and then translated it over to it s win32 equivalent in c++

378386
children	parent
i think the only way to do this is to loop through the parent s children until you find yourself

378406
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
in general this is a main reason why many people choose something like nunit xunit.net or mbunit over mstest

378457
ndepend	fxcop
an alternative to fxcop would be to use the tool ndepend that lets write code rules over c# linq queries namely cqlinq

378474
ndepend	fxcop
an alternative to fxcop would be to use the tool ndepend that lets write code rules over c# linq queries namely cqlinq

378474
ndepend	fxcop
ndepend overlaps with fxcop on some code rules but proposes plenty of unique code rules

378757
hide	show
since there are few events to work with in notes developers commonly use the document refresh as the event to cause the field to hide or show

378757
hide	show
then in your hide when formula for the subject field you specify your criteria for when to show or hide that field

378786
abstract-class	superclass
do you tend to write a dealloc method in the abstract-class and release where appropriate and then allow for children to call super dealloc and then worry about only instance variables they add which aren t part of the superclass

378791
opera	firefox
it covers the internet explorer firefox and opera web browsers with focus on the html css dom and ecmascript technologies

378813
setinterval	settimeout
passing strings instead of functions to settimeout or setinterval

378825
int	boolean
public static boolean morethan1bitset int b

378834
rss	feed
it s a bit like trying to keep up with everything in your rss feed or read absolutely everything on a mailing list

378854
ironruby	ironpython
they are very nice features and i m especially looking forward to ironpython and ironruby as well as new tdd features of vs2010

378874
single-quotes	double-quotes
if it could contain both single-quotes and double-quotes you need to sanitize the output on the server using a server-side technology more sophisticated than

378895
ienumerable	iqueryable
why didn t the compiler force me to cast the ienumerable into an iqueryable

378985
hide	show
i am using a panel to determine whether to hide or show the image but am having trouble with the statement

379014
superclass	subclassing
the superclass should not release objects that its subclassing create

379015
subnet	packets
is it possible to send a udp broadcast packets to a different subnet through a router

379028
gridview	rowdatabound
handle the rowdatabound event in your grid assuming you re using gridview for datagrid it s itemdatabound and then do this

379057
public	protected
which concerns protected fields but what is said there is even more true for public ones

379094
filtering	grouping
then i will start uncommenting the joins select columns grouping order fields filtering to issolate different parts of the query to see what is happening

379131
listboxitem	textbox
the item index in the listbox corresponds to line number in the textbox and the content of the listboxitem is a processed version of the corresponding line in textbox

379158
getter	setter
also you can add debug assertions inside the setter routine and the getter routine though this is less useful to make sure the object is in a valid state when setting the value

379212
apache-poi	jxls
per this so post i found out about jxls which uses apache-poi

379267
mouse	keyboard
the user does something with the keyboard or mouse and that event is sent to the rest of the software

379275
outputstream	inputstream
the problem with your question is that you are mixing outputstream and inputstream

379275
outputstream	inputstream
an inputstream is something you read from and an outputstream is something you write to

379275
outputstream	inputstream
your existing method would be more useful as a generic pipe implementation where you can pipe the data from an inputstream to and outputstream but you don t need it for writing poi objects

379307
children	parent
the one exception to this behavior with one-to-many relationships is when you ve got a list of parent objects that you intend to iterate over and for each parent you want to iterate over its children

379322
inherited	properties
so i guess i could inherited an animal class for common behaviour like walk sleep etc and then have a specialised interface for a lion perhaps which would contain specific behaviour and properties - like the animal is dangerous eats humans etc

379332
websphere	ibm
a few people are pushing hard for using websphere integration developer and websphere process server as the defacto platform for developing future applications...because they feel ibm is a stable vendor the tools are made for the enterprise they drank the business agility bpel kool-aid etc

379338
turbogears	cherrypy
edit the turbogears framework takes the cherrypy web server and bundles other related components such as a template engine data access tools javascript kit etc

379343
implements	extends
it seems to me its very easy to implements an implicit operator versus a typeconverter so i m assuming they aren t equivalent because of the prevalence of typeconverters in the framework see anything that extends frameworkelement

inherited	properties
has-a relationships rather than inherited s is-a relationship. assuming you interface with the api in question via an object maybe you can just keep that object in a properties of your framework main class so you d interact with it like

379449
int	double
fraction double value int

379471
xdebug	xhprof
another option is xhprof which is similar to xdebug but lighter making it suitable for production servers

379472
submit	submission
the link you provided in the question explains that ie6 submit all the buttons with every form submission so your app won t work with ie6 no matter what workaround you use

379494
textmate	bbedit
however textmate bbedit and subethaedit do nicely too

379499
actionscript	haxe
while most other languages are bound to their own platform java to the jvm c# to .net actionscript to the flash player haxe is a multiplatform language

379528
gif	png
this will require a bit more code as what your code is trying to do is to download an already existing image such as a gif png or even another jpeg and converts it to jpeg

379592
implements	extends
one thing you could do is instead of relying on the built-in behavior you could implements a ssoauthorizeattribute which extends the authorizeattribute class and overrides onauthorization

379597
webkit	gecko
if you want to get serious i d start by looking at webkit gecko and oo.org but i guess the algorithms for kerning and size calculation are not trivial

379652
fontfamily	font-size
i would like all of them to have the same fontfamily and font-size

379662
rss	feed
5. rss feed are very valueable in search ranking

379677
for-loop	arrays
from a text file i m trying to store two strings from that file into arrays and then do the same with the next line or until i desire using a for-loop

379695
post	get
the part i m redoing is how i get the information for the last post for the index page

379695
post	get
so i need to grab the latest post_date see which user posted that then see if parentpost is null if it s null then the last post is a new thread so i can get all the info of the title and user there but if it s not then i need to get the info title id of the first post in that thread which can be found by seeing what post_parentpost is looking up that id and getting the title from it

379740
superclass	subclassing
isinstance is preferrable over type because it also evaluates as true when you compare an object instance with it s superclass which basically means you won t ever have to special-case your old code for using it with dict or str subclassing

379749
post	get
for displaying the index page you only have to select data from one table board_forums - this is definitely much faster than selecting a second table to get the last post information even when using a clever join

379798
post	get
get post encrypted obfuscated get - no real difference

379867
put	get
customer x is willing to specify ahead of time what commands she is likely to want to use in windows-speak and then hire the developer to translate those into bash commands and then put them together in a script that allows her to talk windows-speak to bash and get back the list of commands

379907
hide	show
i basically hide and show them so it can go in a loop

379913
puts	gets
but a timer may be a better system or a function that gets them all puts them in an array then pops them off one at a time with a delay in between fading them in one at a time

379953
sorting	grouping
if you re sorting or grouping on the memo fields that could do it because sorting on memo fields is supposed to truncate them to 255 characters though in the test i just ran on a2k3 sp3 with all the latest post-sp3 patches mere sorting doesn t truncate but grouping by does

379970
ccl	ecl
and yes this works in ecl and ccl as well you can use uffi or cffi which simply lets you call c functions which is what other people are talking about

380003
ia-32	x86
if you just need to understand what each instruction does the reference manual for the ia-32 x86 ia64 instruction sets are located here

380008
children	parent
both children and parent have custom drawing routines onpaint

380008
children	parent
4 how does system determine which control is parent to which children and vice-versa

380014
post	get
i have a 100 valid ajax model written in javascript with a few inputs i use being get or post method what page to communicate with what string to send to that page and what element on my own page i might be fiddling with when i receive my response

380014
google-chrome	firefox
the error doesn t come up in firefox or google-chrome as i would exepect as the ajax is asynchronous

380019
dlsym	dlopen
functions dlopen dlsym dlerror dlclose

380068
hide	show
we have created our functional faux- to show so we can hide it by class -ing it as replaced adding

380074
innodb	myisam
this effectively copies the entire myisam table to an innodb table then once that succeeds it drops the myisam table and renames the new innodb table to the name of the former myisam table

380074
innodb	myisam
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

380074
innodb	myisam
unless you re running an old unsupported version of mysql 5.0 or earlier you should use innodb as your default storage engine choice and use myisam only if you can demonstrate a specific workload that benefits from myisam

380075
disk	ram
we are forced to use their desktop pcs for development and those workstations are pretty old models with low ram and single-core pentium 4 cpus and cranky disk

380091
integer	unsigned
the foeign key field and the field being referenced must be of the same type i only use integer and after hours of pain they must be unsigned

380092
int	chars
well then an int field may just be a better bet than a chars 50

380095
serializable	deserialization
if you want to inject your own custom serializable deserialization logic you can use idatacontractsurrogate which can be applied using datacontractserializeroperationbehavior

380106
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere mq 5 and 6

380111
ienumerable	ilist
where you methods would accept either ilist to access the index or ienumerable to use a foreach loop on the collection

380112
mvp	presenter
this is by the way an adaption of the mvp model view presenter pattern

380149
range	minimum
finally if the operands are all neg the minimum will be found in the upper range and the answer will be neg

380162
mvp	presenter
projectname.ui.presenters a couple of presenter for mvp forms

380171
int	chars
note i had to convert the chars to int and subtract 97 to get the appropriate index for the array

380247
super	abstract
belong to a base super class abstract

380357
stdout	stderr
nohup sends stderr and stdout into files

380387
wan	lan
work home.ps1 and work work.ps1 modify the hosts file to go through lan or wan addresses

380392
mouse	keyboard
a good radio keyboard + laser mouse

380442
int	chars
so for example a chars might be the size of a byte on a system while an int may be 4 bytes

380460
folder	directory
if you just want to know whether this directory is under revision control or not you can look for the folder with all the data in it -- for svn it s called .svn you may have to switch on view hidden directory for darcs its _darcs

380470
folder	directory
and as greg states there is also a .svn folder in each directory under svn

380498
children	parent
you represent a certain focus in the tree plus a context up to parent down to children which gives you the whole tree in a form where it s easily modifiable at the focus and it s easy to move the focus up and down

380507
portrait	landscape
how can i stretch the image for landscape mode and make it small again for portrait mode

380558
pyopengl	pyglet
other choices would be pyglet or using pyopengl you can most likely draw to a wx widget too though i ve never done it

380573
debian	linux
in my version of mail debian linux 4.0 the following options work for controlling the source reply addresses

380637
uninstall	upgrade
not a direct answer but the key difference between an upgrade and an uninstall+ a reinstall is that any custom uninstall steps are not called in 2k8 but are in 2k5

380637
versioning	upgrade
the other difference related to this is that in 2k8 the files get upgrade based on the versioning info resource - if your modules dont have newer versioning they dont get replaced

380671
uninstall	downgrade	uninstall	upgrade
as 2008 doesnt do a naive uninstall + install the install step would need to be able to handle both upgrade and downgrade scenarios

380706
notepad++	textpad	notepad	textpad
ordinarily text editors identify this bom correctly notepad does as does notepad++ i m not familiar with textpad

380732
vmware	virtualbox
maybe you can replicate the environment with a vmware disk image or in virtualbox or similar and debug this faster

380750
redmine	trac
trac doesn t have time management support while redmine does

380750
redmine	trac
for these reason in my company we are thinking to switch from trac to redmine

380757
redmine	trac
i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac

380765
hide	show
you can decide via parameters per-row and show-empty if you want empty cells to show up or if you want to hide them

380781
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
monitor all calls to new delete and malloc calloc realloc free

380781
free	malloc
with this you can identify wrong calls new free or malloc delete or missing

380793
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
overusing libraries for selecting nodes with complex selectors when native methods can be used getelementbyid getelementsbytagname etc.

380813
downcasting	upcasting
upcasting is allowed in java however downcasting gives a compile error

380839
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i work for ibm as a websphere consultant so my thoughts are influenced by that and the ibm product most often suggested as an answer to the above questions websphere service registry and repository

380855
opera	firefox
what is the correct syntax to create objects in javascript that will work across the majority of web browsers by that i mean ie 6+ firefox 2+ opera 9+

380866
3des	aes
sha1 | md5 | 3des | aes

380866
des	aes	3des	aes
auto | des | 3des | aes

380889
coalesce	isnull
i have tried isnull case statements coalesce and dynamic sql with exec and sp_executesql and failed to implement any of these

380932
getter	setter
while the anonymous function gets executed right away the getter setter get executed for the first time when they are called

380937
translation	localization
to use the built in localization resource provider in asp.net can only handle translation strings see getstring key locale with no user defined arguments if i have read the documentation correct

380985
udp	tcp
tcp udp 53 dns

381016
hide	show
i am using a panel to determine whether to hide or show the image but am having trouble with the statement

381025
getter	setter
in the above example i am creating a new object inside of the function and then attaching getter and setter to this newly created object

381063
post	get
i need fire a filter method with all string in get or post value from http request before it was bind into controller action

381082
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
is there a similar mechanism in hdl vhdl or verilog

381088
gridview	repeater
it executes a query using oracle and binds the results to a gridview and repeater webcontrol

381155
onmouseover	onclick
3. any onclick onmouseover etc

381205
disassembly	shellcode
i ve disassembly the shellcode

381214
google-chrome	firefox
i have observed this behavior in google-chrome and firefox

381226
implements	extends
you can extends defaultwidget to create your own nicewidget and implements your own calculateheight to return a nicer size

381235
boost	stl	wtl	atl
this is what i m doing now and i m using all of the nice things like stl atl wtl boost sqlite directx etc

381235
ogre	irrlicht
if you just want to make a game with artists and other people collaborating to create a finished product use one of the existing engines ogre irrlicht nebula torque etc and just add in your game logic and art

381235
boost	stl
as i ve come to realise that other libraries such as stl boost directx etc have an order of magnitude or three more man-hours of development time in them far more than i could ever spend on that portion of the game engine

381349
post	put
see also this stackoverflow post for a discussion on what content to put into functional specs

381368
cpu	processors
the cpu always reads at its word size 4 bytes on a 32-bit processors so when you do an unaligned address access â on a processors that supports it â the processors is going to read multiple words

381369
gridview	detailsview
that is..can you disable viewstate for an entire page with standard controls like detailsview gridview and would it still work

381369
gridview	detailsview
or in order to work with controlstate for standard server controls you have to modify their behavior by creating a new custom gridview detailsview

381385
ienumerable	icollection
the .net 3.5 extension method ienumerable t .count will enumerate behind the scenes if the return value does not implement icollection t which may be undesirable

381385
ilist	icollection
i often return ilist t or icollection t when the result is a collection - internally your method can use a list t and either return it as-is or return list t .asreadonly if you want to protect against modification if you re caching the list internally

381436
pascal	delphi
when i was working with delphi i had to convert code samples from c into object pascal - doable but tedious lots of friction

381439
post	get
are you looking for this parameter in your get params or your post params

381452
teamcity	nant
the annoying thing is that nant gui can run the build file without error so i don t see why teamcity should fail since i believe it to be using the same subversion client as nant gui and the same ms .net framework version too

381471
folder	directory
the wildcard option on the getdirectories call will allow you to grab all the directory contained in the windows folder directly that match the pattern sys

381471
folder	directory
for instance say you wanted folder that are contained by folder directly inside the windows directory - i have no idea how you would go about something like that i m afraid...i don t imagine exporting the entire tree structure to xml and using xpath to do it would be so efficient - the xpath would be fabulously simple for parsing out using wildcards - but converting to xml wouldn t be so efficient.

381494
min	max
it s quick and easy to tell if there s overlap in the sets since you only have to compare the min and max values to order them

381494
min	max
in the simple case above set2 max set1 min set4 min set1 max and set1 and set3 have some overlap

381495
int	double
if you are dealing with simple values like int or double it will not matter performance wise if you resize and set or reserve and push_back

381497
put	get
i put it in my root assembly for my application framework and enforce is at the root so it is very easy to get to

381509
mouse	keyboard
can t you just place a transparent window over the entire control and capture all the mouse and keyboard events there

381520
width	height
the width of the treeview should drive the width of the other objects and i need the height of the textblock to change to display the full text

381550
put	get
does that one happen before or after the alert your put after get

381559
hash	md5
if it s a well-known algorithm like md5 and someone can get hold of the hash output then on their own cpu time they can rapidly check against possible passwords and if they find a match then they ve got the password

381632
post	get
i prefer the second one because you can have more option for post get or for cookie

381727
awt	swing
for now anyway gnu java gcj has not implemented a lot of these - most importantly i think that the desktop awt swing has not been done

381873
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a gridview that is using a linqdatasource for it s datasource

381967
range	max
i saw a method for getting scale and precision from the data but my data doesn t necessarily have values in the max range of scale and precision from the xml files

381975
int	boolean
for example consider cases when is false boolean or 0 int

381992
translation	localization
they are generally licensed in two forms one for the developer to generate localization assemblies or resx source code and one for the translator to store translation strings to from an internal database

382063
octal	decimal
if the web service returns 0010 i want the autocomplete extender to also display 0010 and not interpret it as octal and display a decimal equivalent

382083
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i also came across a topic in the apache documentation that suggests putting the configuration in the httpd.conf file instead of .htaccess files

382129
content-disposition	content-type
when you put the object in s3 you need to also include content-type and content-disposition headers and whatever else you may want

382137
getter	setter
i have cursed at the annoyance of making getter and setter myself though so i understand why one would want to make creating those as easy as possible but i d rather see get set and getset annotations than more syntax thingamajiggers to do the job

382171
google-chrome	safari
this works like a charm in most browsers except that it doesn t in webkit browsers like safari and google-chrome

382171
submit	submission
i don t care if the enter key submission is undesireable without javascript on webkit browsers but i can t remove or change the order of the submit buttons

382267
jsf	seam
the move to a newer version of richfaces will also result in never versions of jboss and seam as the current production build of richfaces 3.2.1 requires jsf 1.2

382292
post	get
alternately you could have a textbox with an id of id and a submit button in a form that post to home get

382294
put	get
these control where the to workspace and from workspace blocks get and put their results

382319
implements	extends
i realized that a more elegant approach is indeed to use a router but for that you would need to create a custom one by extends the zend_controller_router_abstract class and implements the route method

382516
public	protected
this mean it could have more than one sections of private public or protected

382518
imperative	declarative
declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code

382528
3des	dsa	3des	aes	rsa	aes	rsa	3des	rsa	dsa
now this application was never fully finished so i don t support things like dsa key-pairs but i do support rsa key pairs with sha1 md5 using idea aes i think my 3des code does not work correctly but i may have fixed that since

382535
versioning	upgrade
deactivate reactivate feature -- i would wrap the updated dll back into the sharepoint solution file change my code above to reflect the new versioning and use stsadmin to upgrade the solution

382576
uiview	subviews
i have a .xib file containing a uiview and 2 uilabel subviews linked to a class named note with outlets assigned to each label appropriately the definition for this class contains the following

382576
getter	setter
i m assuming i don t because i m not explicitly retaining these objects anywhere in my code and i don t synthesize these into getter setter

382641
multiplication	modulo
this approach isn t unbreakable but it s a step up from using a constant for the xor-ing - and prngs are very simple to implement typically consisting of one multiplication and modulo for each word

382698
post	get
my previous post did not get formatted correctly

382740
width	height
have you tried simply setting the width and height to zero

382740
width	height
but then width and height are only supported on all elements starting from version 4.3

382740
width	height
so perhaps the safest way to really make it work on all blackberry firmware versions is to use an image for the warning and use css to set its width and height to zero

382740
width	height
i don t know if setting its width and height to zero would still hide that alt text then

382751
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
firefox opera safari and ie8 beta 2 all do correctly find out the feed and lighten up the relevant address bar button - it s just ie7 that stays greyed out

382755
innodb	myisam
while i agree with the innodb comments i will give a solution to your myisam problem

382760
put	get
if you can t get an alias to work just write a short shell script chmod +x and put it somewhere in your path like home bin

382760
bash	tcsh
i don t have any experience with tcsh but with bash you do it like any of these

382781
vim	emacs
question does emacs have a canonical equivalent of vim s folding with foldmethod indent

typically across the 3 drawing methods the major browsers use canvas svg vml text support is poor i believe

382835
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade to the 3.5 versioning of msbuild

382960
rss	feed
many people think that rss should be plain text and that css in rss feed is inappropriate

382960
rss	feed
it s probably not appropriate to impose a different font on your rss feed

383102
jobs	cron
django-command-extensions also has commands for automating scripts as cron jobs which is something you mentioned that you d like to do

383102
jobs	cron
if you are a more nuts and bolts type of person you might check out this very detailed post outlining how to make standalone django scripts to be run from cron jobs and whatnot

383109
maple	sage
alternatives to python+numpy scipy are r and computer algebra systems sage mathematica matlab maple

383124
x509	openpgp
what you need is public-key encryption using either openpgp or x509

383124
x509	openpgp
in both cases you can encrypt the single block of data for multiple recipients using their openpgp keys or x509 respectively

383165
emacs	textmate
i m not sure what platform you are on but textmate can do all of that as can emacs

383171
bluetooth	usb
i would like to create a desktop application preferably in c# running on .net or mono that would read write information phone book calendar calls text messages etc. from to my connected usb bluetooth symbian phone se p990i but i don t seem to be able to pick up the right keywords to google for it hence cannot get started

383201
accessor	properties
this properties is not directly accessible with scripts but it is the chain of objects referred to with the internal prototype properties that is used in properties accessor resolution

383201
inherited	properties
the value of this properties is either null or an object and is used for implementing inherited

383221
opera	firefox
i would imagine pipelining as supported in http 1.1 would mitigate the connection limit issue but it is disabled by default in firefox and ie opera has it enabled

383232
inherited	properties
every object has a hidden properties which is used for inherited

383255
public	protected
public or protected methods generally always deserve separate

383265
public	protected

383290
inherited	properties
inherited the valueof properties from the

383290
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and ie7 has named their functions opera and ie7 tells you that it will not reveal the implementation

383290
opera	google-chrome
i get undefined from opera and ie7 null from google-chrome and object object from ff3

383320
firefox	safari
now i have run into another issue that works well in ie7 but not in firefox 3 and safari

383336
vb.net	vb6
while i have no direct experience about vb.net against vb6 old habits i do for c++ against stripped-down c-like c++

383366
inherited	properties
function.prototype is the prototype from which all function objects inherited - it might contain properties like call and apply which are common to all function instances

383366
inherited	properties
objects which are created using function.prototype as constructor would inherited its properties - but as there should be no reason to do something insane like this setting it to null undefined or an empty object is reasonable

383405
put	get
i put together a small test page to isolate the problem but couldn t get it to work at that page either

383502
pull	push
i agree with frankodwyer flip the protocol from a pull model to a push model

383519
udp	tcp
moreover the protocol caters for reliable ip multicasting which in a multi-client environment may give you performance-wise a definite edge against anything implemented using point-to-point tcp or udp connections only

383522
post	get
greasemonkey embedded a local flash file that would fetch the image based on a url in the source of the webpage use actionscript to get the darkest pixel and then send a post request with those coordinates as values

383540
dictionary	map
javascript has no built-in general map type sometimes called associative array or dictionary which allows to access arbitrary values by arbitrary keys

383540
getter	setter
javascript s fundamental data structure is the object a special type of map which only accepts strings as keys and has special semantics like prototypical inheritance getter and setter and some further voodoo

383540
inherited	properties
you might also involuntarily access its inherited properties if you don t check hasownproperty

383563
int	boolean
the boolean values are compiled to int data type in jvm

383579
rss	feed
unfortunately the rss feed are useless since the file names are meaningless

383582
int	chars
since strings in java are unbounded in length and each chars has 16 bits and int have 32 bits you could only produce a unique mapping of strings to int if the strings were up to two chars

383608
int	double
use double version check for overflow over max int or max long and cast to int or long

383635
opera	firefox
the next step would be to pass the string to javascript and in javascript you could take advantage of the ability to embed base64 images supported in firefox opera not ie

383705
hash	md5
aside from this there are cryptographic hash functions such as md5 and sha where collisions are extremely unlikely though with a lot of effort can be forced

383705
hash	md5
note there are also some theoretical weaknesses in some hash functions md5 but for your purposes that probably doesn t matter and you could just use the most efficient such function - those weaknesses are only relevant if someone is maliciously trying to come up with strings that have the same code as another string

capitalization of methods tends to be a mixed bag my methods tend to be verbs and are already distingished by parens so i don t capitalize methods

383775
getter	setter
is there a way to define a mustoverride property with mixed getter setter access level

383777
rss	feed
or if anyone knows a good way to read in the rss feed and spit out the recent status update

383833
next	except
an alternative would be to access each element and then null their references to the next node but then i d be basically doing it like in c++ except i wouldn t be explicitly using delete

383836
free	malloc
setting pointers to null in java is not the same as in c where setting a malloc ed pointer to null prevents it from being free

383887
versioning	upgrade
now that i ve upgrade my sdk to the latest versioning which i presume is the versioning that the online docs refer to i get behaviour that is at least consistent with the docs

autofac	castle-windsor
find an ioc that you like and integrate it into your application structuremap unity spring.net castle-windsor autofac ninject...pick one

383919
pull	push
seems to be there s a push and pull between coordination of data and flexibility of behavior which can be mitigated by putting the singleton around just shared data with the smallest amount of behavior as possible to ensure data integrity

384029
httprequest	httpresponse
if the system had httprequest and httpresponse objects the simplest way to dispatch would be to use a single function that routes to all of the possible choices

384035
min	max
this way the size of the galaxy is only limited by the max and min of the number used to hold the seeds

384038
internationalization	localization
i have always thought that the terms internationalization and localization and their funny abbreviations i18n and l10n were universally accepted and used for talking about software which is aware of language and cultural differences

384051
hide	show
if you mean an overlay element you can use the webbrowser navigating and loadcompleted events to show and hide the element

384057
hide	show
you are going to need to add another function call to hide the other div after the first call to show it

384057
hide	show

384083
googletest	cppunit
i prefer cruisecontrol.net with cppunit but i don t have any experience or knowledge of the googletest framework

384102
tortoisegit	svn
nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk

384132
dlsym	dlopen
in linux unix you can use the posix dlopen dlsym dlerror dlclose functions to dynamically open shared libraries and access the symbols including functions they provide see the man page for details

384192
dwoo	smarty
you might also want to take at a new template library that is similar to smarty called dwoo

384278
rss	feed
i did however finally manage to find the rss feed in the new profile version

384319
inherited	properties
this isn t the good part since you should always edit this part yourself but if you inherited methods and properties from either a base class or as in your case an interface it will copy the documentation automatically

384324
opera	firefox
in firefox opera and ie 7 i see the ocean.png and am able to click it

384324
google-chrome	safari
when i load this same code in safari windows and mac as well as in google-chrome the ocean.png is not seen and there is no button to click

384324
google-chrome	safari
is there something i can add or do to get this code design to work in safari and google-chrome

384343
opera	firefox
maybe ie firefox and opera finds it illegal syntax and rewrite the input outside of the select but webkit does not

384380
opera	google-chrome
this code is tested in ff3 ie7 google-chrome 1 and opera 9

384464
public	protected
internal types cannot be part of a public protected api as the consumer would have no way of using it

384603
filtering	grouping
the types of operations people will want to do with the reports are predictable filtering sort grouping by add or remove columns export to csv etc

384639
opera	firefox
the task seems to be pretty easy how to include a javascript file in xml-document so that at least opera and firefox could actually parse it and execute the code

384640
bazaar	git
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools

384672
integer	unsigned
if you design your software around platform-neutral integer type names probably using the c99 header which when the types are available on the platform provides in signed listed and unsigned not listed

384716
postorder	inorder
taking your question at face value you want to print out the nodes in breadth-first order rather than using one of the standard depth-first orderings inorder or pre-order or postorder

384721
put	get
when i double click on a control in the designer it opens the .h file which i ve understood to be for prototype declarations and if i put all the guts to the functions in there i can get my program to work but i don t like having the code in the .h file

384890
imperative	declarative
for various reasons that i won t go into i want to stay with a declarative language and not some imperative scripting language such as groovy

384896
spaces	delimiter
.as ascii string of bytes - any delimiter except white spaces - whatever started it ended it

384906
public	protected
but ultimately it is the base-classes job to manage the state of those fields via any public protected etc members

384906
base-class	subclassing
the subclassing has to include all the fields from the base-class for it to make sense

384935
x86	64bit
at my company we have a mix of 32-bit x86 and 64bit x64 developer machines

384995
width	height
in fact if you read the notes on the other constructor overloads you ll see all the size or width and height measurements for finding the correct size icon in the file

384996
postgresql	mysql
somebody advised me to use php with postgresql or mysql

385040
googletest	gmock
however now i would take a long hard look at googletest and gmock as they would probably complement each other quite well

385087
ubuntu	centos
if you don t have the budget for another machine then use virtualization openvz is cool if your web server is hosted on ubuntu or centos to limit the cpu quota for the parser

385098
firefox	safari
it works fine with and tags but when i use import inside a it doesn t show up in the array - only as a cssrule style is undefined in safari 3 and firefox 3

385137
put	get
set the log level to debug and make sure this is not on a production machine because it produces a lot of output per individual event get put

385138
strlen	strncpy
however for the length parameter in strncpy i used strlen on the string in the symbol table

385147
atan2	sine
any other format is going to rely on another implementation of sine cosine atan2 and square root at a minimum

385187
int	double
if there might be an issue with precision loss when using double or you won t be doing trigonometry i d suggest your solution of mapping to an int range - this will give you the best resolution can easily be converted to whatever display format you re locale will be using and - after choosing an appropriate 0-meridian - can be used to convert to floating point values of high precision

385223
post	get
and in your previous post you were probably voted down by people like me who use php to get things done

385224
memcached	apc
that being said php + memcached apc + beanstalkd goes a long way

385256
getter	setter
grade and teacher are automatic properties which are roughly equivalent to getter and setter in java which would be methods

385491
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i have tested firefox ie7 opera and google-chrome

385491
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome does a normal if-modified-since and opera ignores the key

385500
gif	png
only stream jpg gif or png files

385572

i need to convert strings in python to other types such as unsigned and signed 8 16 32 and 64 bit int double floats and strings

385653
factors	mean
btw if you don t know actionscript i mean its details quirks etc don t forget to factors in the time it will take googling for answers

385663
gif	png
very low overhead using png gif format

385713
integer	unsigned
assuming you have signed integers in your columns you may need to use cast a b as signed since the result of the operator is an unsigned 64-bit integer in mysql

385747
imperative	declarative
yes it s imperative rather than declarative and repeats the event name - but it s still pretty compact

385784
button	checkbox	hide	show
this listbox has an associated style to display the answers in the form of radio button or checkbox which i would like to hide or show depending on the question type as

385850
awt	swing
for more information about repainting in awt refer to painting in awt and swing

385889

if i correctly interpret your question you should check if your current windows account has the ntfs filesystems permission to modify the solution file .sln

385909
pop-up	dialog
i like to have a pop-up modal dialog that need to show the list of options like a radio button select event

385909
pop-up	dialog
when i run this no radio button is shown in the pop-up dialog

385931
try-catch	exception-handling
this means that the developer doesn t have to surround an exception-handling throwing clause inside a try-catch block

386070
udp	tcp
the sip communication will use tcp instead of udp because we specified it in the url and your application can look up the account information before you speak with the caller

386101
post	get
if for any reason get or post content-length is not in the header it means there s nothing to read after the blank line crlf

386232
xen	openvz
my other solution was to install xen or openvz and create n different vps per each ip but as you can see is definitely a pita -

386303
google-chrome	safari
the for each...in construct doesn t seem to work at least in this case in safari 5 or google-chrome 5

386315
inherited	properties
each of our model classes inherited from an objectbase base class which includes db access functions and change tracking so when someone changes a value through a properties the object is automatically marked dirty and notifications are fired to whatever object ui has subscribed to those events

386372
post	get
can you use post instead of get

386384
hash	salt
if not you can just salt and hash it

386468
trac	bugzilla
i d stick with svn and use trac or bugzilla or fogbugz

386468
perforce	svn
i prefer the perforce svn and separate defect tracking solution

hash	md5
md5 hash

386483

support for jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools

386501
firefox	safari
i got it to work in both safari and firefox haven t tested the other browsers yet

386506
actionscript	mxml
i think that i just don t fully understand how data binding works in flex - this is not a problem when using mxml components but when using actionscript classes the binding does not work

386581
width	height
here s a function i wrote that takes a gd image object max width max height and rescales within those parameters

386591
post	get
found some post here and went thru them and couldn t get it to work

386612
folder	directory
or can it be a folder directory on my computer

386629
gif	png
since the png and gif graphics files are essentially representations of bit patterns perhaps you can find the compression algorithm they use

386646
ironruby	ironpython
silverlight only supports .net languages such as visual basic c# managed javascript ironpython and ironruby

386665
gallery	shadowbox	shadowbox	lightbox
i have an image gallery that is swapping images and i want to link the swapped image to come up even larger in a shadowbox lightbox

386667
ninject	spring.net
unless there s a very good reason i wouldn t go reinvent the wheel and implement a ioc container myself specially because there are are a lot of good options like unity ninject or spring.net

386673
awt	swing
as a general tip the painting in awt and swing article describes how you should handle repainting in either awt or swing

386726
cobertura	checkstyle
good amount of useful plugins like integrated checkstyle findbugs cobertura and so on - heck we even put continuous integration game to our hudson

386744
post	get	webclient	httpwebrequest
for c# i prefer to use httpwebrequest over webclient because you can have more option in the future like having get post parameter using cookies etc

386810
cvs	svn
support for lots of version control systems i ve used it with cvs svn and starteam

386826
ati	nvidia
a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this

386835
redmine	trac
redmine is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than trac and seems to be much easier to administer

386853
gif	png
have you tried using a gif or png

386853
gif	ico	gif	png	png	ico
the format of the image must be one of png a w3c standard gif or ico

386870
opera	firefox
i can see it in firefox and opera too as is

386889
versioning	upgrade
the very important thing is to make sure not to let the licenses lapse as the renewals on licenses cost a fraction of the initial cost and also include versioning upgrade

386904
content-disposition	content-type
as explained by alex s link you re probably missing the header content-disposition on top of content-type

386948
matlab	simulink
scilab is a numerical computation system similiar to matlab or simulink

386967
coalesce	isnull
if one of the terms in an expression is null the result of the expression is meaningless - unless the expression explicitly indicates via isnull or coalesce what to do if the term is null

386984
width	height
they allow you to expand the browser window any way you like but only stretch the presentation area so that it fits the smallest of the height or width

386996
innodb	myisam
the fulltext search engine is only available for the myisam engine not innodb which is the most commonly used engine due to its referential integrity and acid compliance

386996
innodb	myisam
basically you would have a table quotes that is an innodb table that rather than having your text field data you have a reference quote_data_id which points to the id on a quote_data table which is a myisam table

386996
innodb	myisam
you can do your fulltext on the myisam table join the ids returned with your innodb tables and voila you have your results

387020
put	get
then use with rcov and you will get some very readable out put that will tell you what files have 0 usage

387060
vim	emacs
same environment will work on solaris as well but this is of course force you to use vim as editor i pretty sure that emacs can work with both ctags and cscope as well

387110
width	height
you can reserve aspect ratio of contents using wpf s viewbox with control with fixed width and height inside

387150
width	height
through experimentation i have seen that the iphone will refuse to draw a frame that is bigger than 2000 pixels in either height or width

387255
bluetooth	usb
will tell you how to programmatically read messages contacts agenda and send them over usb or bluetooth

387267
getter	setter
and if you re coding in c# automatic setter and getter are a boon

387273
hide	show
the way i have accomplished this is by creating a user control with exposed show and hide methods

387291
filtering	grouping
for example if you have 55 000 rows returned for the report and the report server then has to grouping sort and or filtering those rows to render the report then that could take additional time

387291
filtering	grouping
i would have a look at the way the data is being grouping and filtering in the report then review your stored procedure to see if you could offload some of that processing to the sql code maybe using some parameters

387291
filtering	grouping
try and aim to reduce the the amount of rows returned to the report to be the minimum needed to render the report and preferably try to avoid doing the grouping and filtering in the report itself

387309
folder	directory
task under directory home i have various users home folder aaa bbb ccc .

387338
width	margin
grid column width resizes to textbox width + textbox margin

387350
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
since i develop on a mac i m a switcher after 20 years on windows and very happy having done so i test the sites in firefox 3 and safari 3 on my os x machine on a windows xp vm i test firefox 2 ie6 7 and 8 using ietester plus whichever other browser i want such as opera and google-chrome

387352
google-chrome	safari
when the user creates a home screen shortcut for the site it will launch in fullscreen mode separate from the normal mobile safari application and without the url bar or other google-chrome

387367
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
even if you could do true debugging each browser parses html it s own way so even if you could step through firefox to see how a rendering bug occurs that won t help you with ie or safari google-chrome at all because they execute parsing in their own manner

387395
button	checkbox
on the advanced options button there is a checkbox called refresh the data table

387487
google-chrome	firefox
you would have to punch a hole in the firewall to use a new browser like firefox or google-chrome

387534
firefox	safari
for firefox and safari the first condition is true for ie7 the second condition is true but for ie6 it falls to the last condition

387542
client-side	server-side
since you need both client-side for user convenience server-side because we re really very much past trusting the client at this point it seems like quite a decent idea to support both from a single infrastructure

387565
tabcontrol	tabitem
you can use a style applied to tabitem with a datatrigger that will collapse it if the parent tabcontrol has only one item

387581
post	get
i ll post this comment so it doesn t get destroyed before i can finish

387607
getter	setter
if you plan to set and or change these values dynamically during execution then use class variable with getter and setter

387613
javadb	hsqldb
in the java world i prefer using embedded databases such as hsqldb h2 or javadb f.k.a

387654
memcpy	memmove
i have experimented with memmove and memcpy and can t replicate this behavior

387654
memcpy	memmove
why do memmove and memcpy behave this way

387656
des	aes
but remember that block algorithms such as aes and des work with 8 or 16 byte blocks so you will need to pad the array to what the algorithm needs

387669
width	height
allows you to set the width height and scale values

387671
memcpy	memmove
why do memmove and memcpy behave this way

387679
entity-relationship	diagram
i would highly recommend learning how to put together a simple entity-relationship diagram

387702
stdout	stderr
it would have to apply automatically to stdout and probably stderr too

387702
stdout	stderr
if you use any of the features of io handle with your tied stdout or stderr it s basically a crapshoot to get them working reliably - i could not find a way to get the autoflush method of io handle to work on my tied handle

387739
mkdir	chdir
that is _stricmp _chdir _mkdir _getcwd instead of stricmp chdir mkdir getcwd etc.

387768
gif	png
i would really like to use a png instead of gif or jpeg

387773
memcpy	memmove
memmove and memcpy don t work that way because it s not a useful semantic for moving or copying memory

387775
r5rs	r6rs
this seems to be the case in both r5rs and r6rs

387796
disk	ram
this can be either ram or part of the page file system on the hard disk

387843
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the first argument in a w3c-compliant browser google-chrome firefox safari ie9+

387879
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
now i have found a way to do this in firefox using image tags that executes php scripts on the other domains essentially creating the different cookies on the different domains but this method doesn t work in ie havn t tested opera or safari etc

387885
lisp	smalltalk	lisp	scheme
i recommend everybody to learn lisp scheme or smalltalk

387885
squeak	visualworks
and yes there are more than one free ones squeak dolphin smalltalk x and visualworks non-comercial

387892
width	height
i had expected that you could two-way bind the width to the height using a value converter to maintain aspect ratio

387921
globalization	localization
i have a page that i use with globalization localization and i am redirecting via server not code from www.spanishversion.com to www.englishversion.com but the url is masked to still say www.spanishversion.com

387938
uiview	uiwindow
i ve tried other uiview types uiview uiwindow and see the same behavior so it s not restricted to uiwebview

388049
squeak	visualworks
in multiplatform smalltalk vms go for visualworks or squeak

388049
lua	scheme	lisp	scheme
well there are a lot of more to get your hands on scheme lisp ruby lua bash

388099
mouseleave	mouseenter
is adding another image inside the stack panel and then setting it s visibility to visible the right approach on mouseenter and then swapping back on mouseleave

388121
int	boolean
i picked miniature_count over owns for the name because owns sounds like a method that should return a boolean instead of an int

388123
width	height
when i try to reuse this on another page the loaded images are shrunken resized - i would like them to match whats defined in the width height but they get scaled depending on how the stage is scaled

388123
width	height
then in html the width height would be set to the width height of the images being loaded

388139
width	height
ideally you can pass in the height width via the attributes of the embed tag have a no resize on the canvas and use the passed in dimensions to set your image dimenions

388146
free	memmove
the compiler is free to choose a method that is more efficient than memmove

388165
memcpy	memmove
finally memcpy memmove aren t what you are looking for those are for making copies of blocks of memory from from area to another memmove allows source and dest to be part of the same buffer

388206
children	parent
however it is possible to alter a field in the parent object which requires persistence and i can determine that none of the children are affected

388223
google-chrome	firefox
and this is how it displays in firefox 3 google-chrome 1.0 and ie7 click for full size

388264
installation	upgrade
for example i ve setup netbeans flexbuilder eclipse textmate vmware fusion openoffice firefox dragged terminal.app to my dock upgrade the ruby installation and related gems and so on.

388264
fink	macports
macports or fink

388269
vim	aquamacs	vim	emacs	macvim	aquamacs	macvim	emacs	emacs	aquamacs
if you re an emacs vim user there s aquamacs and macvim

388276
vmware	virtualbox
you ve already done everything i have except i m using virtualbox instead of vmware

388277
mouse	keyboard
another tip is to get a decent keyboard and mouse

388277
mouse	keyboard
get yourself a real keyboard and a real mouse with multiple buttons

388297
ubuntu	linux
i m a .net developer and been asp programmer for more than 10 years so all i did was microsoft related never ever aparat of installing and playing with ubuntu i had experience in the linux world

388300
serializable	deserialization
hand-written serializable deserialization using binaryreader and binarywriter

388315
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
especially problems where a subclassing does not implement clone but inherited from a superclass that implements cloneable

388359
bazaar	git
but bazaar is really slow and i m thinking of moving to git

388389
mbunit	nunit
it adds to nunit the rowtest feature from mbunit

388398
post	get
if you search for odm or oidadmin you get a few pointers such as this forum post

388422
fink	macports
i second macports it is more up to date than fink and closer to the freebsd ports system where i come from

388439
public	protected
since object.clone is protected rewriting it in the interface would force all implementers to provide a public implementation which class designers might not want to they might opt to keep it protected

388448
public	protected
a better design would be to have something like .net s memberwiseclone as a protected method in object and then a public clone method within the interface itself

388482
int	chars
have a look at org.apache.commons.lang.stringutils#rightpad string str int size chars padchar

388492
gif	png
this is especially lame for creating a web based game using png or gif sprites

388499
opera	safari
i think if you look at safari and opera you ll find they also filter the image

388601
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
according to mozilla opacity has been supported since firefox 0.9 opera 9 and safari 1.2 and filter since ie4

388658
google-chrome	safari
since you are on windows anyway you could try using the inbuilt javascript debugger of google-chrome which is a browser very similar to safari although the javascript engine is different

388742
ienumerable	iqueryable
you can easily create your own extension method on ienumerable or iqueryable

388761
ienumerable	ilist
so it is better to add addxxx removexxx method to the owner of the class and expose list an an ienumerable or which is better in my opinion expose it as an ilist and use observablecollection from windowsbase

388827
cil	ildasm
i ve done a lot of static analysis in .net cil last year and the best way to go is to use ildasm or any disassembler that will give you some quite easy to parse il language text file

388930
freebsd	debian
i can find it on debian and freebsd

388937
width	height
the autosize doesn t work because it will grow in width not in height

389019
put	get
basically the global.asax file doesn t actually get compiled so vs2008 put in a fix to prevent you from modifying it since your modifications will have no effect

389039
inherited	subclassing
the joined subclassing mapping in particular i think you will find helpful assuming wibbleextended inherited from wibble

389050
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i know that microsoft isn t developing it any further and that firefox safari opera and camino all run on mac and from my stats they are most used in that order .

389062
swt	swing
i find that i get things done faster than i did in swing or swt too

389088
lisp	scheme
if you have a chance i would recommand getting a copy of lisp scheme and doing some projects in it

now i want to know its new height and width on the screen so i can draw accurately on the new scaled image

389352
pthreads	fork	execvp	fork
speaking of platform-dependent recipes on windows use createprocess on pthreads linux mac use fork + execvp

389389
mouseup	mousedown
there are mousedown and mouseup events that you can handle to get a similar effect

389389
keydown	keyup
you ll have to do that with a keydown and keyup event

389389
mouseup	mousedown
also be aware that a mousedown event may not ever be followed by a mouseup event if the user moves the mouse after pressing down to a point where it is no longer over the button

389389
mouseup	mousedown
you can capture the mouse in mousedown to guarantee you get the mouseup event i think

389390
inherited	properties
inherited is done via delegation if an object doesn t have a method or properties it is looked up on its prototype s the object it was cloned from then the prototype s prototypes and so on

389397
mouseup	mousedown
there are mousedown and mouseup attached events available

389409
google-chrome	firefox
if you look in the firefox application directory wherever you installed it on your system you ll see a google-chrome directory with a bunch of .jar files

389424
gridview	rowdatabound
i typically bind this data using the rowdatabound event with the gridview

389438
onmousedown	onmouseup
that didn t work so then i thought maybe it s actually the onmouseup or onmousedown events that trigger the anchor tag so i added a clickswallow method to onmouseup and onmousedown methods

389451
google-chrome	firefox
if a user leaves their browser window open to this page for about 45-60 minutes then attempting to navigate elsewhere will cause ie v7 for sure v6 as well i believe firefox or google-chrome do not have this issue to display the following popup

389451
profiling	debugging
i ve seen that in a similar question someone suggested using ibm page profiling to debugging this issue

389456

in addition to triptych s answer hoozit instances will also inherited all instance properties of gizmo not only the ones defined in the prototype

389475
client-side	server-side
you re trying to mix server-side code with client-side code

389475
client-side	server-side
or - if your aim is to raise custom events server-side rather than client-side and handle them in javascript render out calls to the functions

389496
freebsd	linux
what are some alternatives to make for linux freebsd

389497
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
you can also sublcass uiscrollviewcontroller and override the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods

389574
gridview	objectdatasource
make sure that you master the gridview and the objectdatasource objects used to fill them

389574
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
if you don t use a business layer then you ll use sqldatasource or linqdatasource objects to access your data directly from the ui

389582
queue	fifo
i ve been searching for information for a common kernel implementation of queue that is fifo data structures

389664
uipagecontrol	uitableview
so my question to you usability ui experts is is putting a uitableview inside of uipagecontrol a poor design choice

389705
public	protected
rearrange code so private protected and public methods and grouped

389732
queue	fifo
you seem to confusing an abstraction a fifo queue with an implementation a linked list

389744
for-loop	loops
a continue statement without a label will re-execute from the condition the innermost while or do loops and from the update expression of the innermost for-loop

389774

then in the rowdatabound event for the gridview you can programmatically call out and get the appropriate lookup information and display that in the column specified

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
.net provides two classes sorteddictionary and sortedlist and both are implemented using a binary tree

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

389813
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

389824
innodb	myisam
you asked in a comment about whether to use myisam or innodb

389824
innodb	myisam
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

389824
innodb	myisam
innodb wins over myisam frequently enough that it s clearly not possible to say one is faster than the other

389866
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
what about other browsers like opera or firefox or google-chrome on windows

389931
chown	chgrp

width	height
if i remove the height and width in the controls xaml file i lose the ability to use the designer for my user control

390012
width	height
if i set the grid width and height to auto then everything works fine but i lose the ability to use the designer

390079

freebsd netbsd openbsd dragonfly

390111
playstation	wii
playstation 3 wii and gp2x consoles

390127
udp	tcp
i guess the simplest solution would be to just open a tcp stream send a few packets back and forth to determine their running time or even use udp for that then use the results as the guide for my max latency value then simply fire the audio data in its raw form uncompressed 16 bit stereo along with a timing code over the tcp connection

390150
kerberos	ldap
i know that ad uses kerberos but not sure if java s ldap methods do

390153
button	checkbox
the user control will display the question answer appropriately meaning render the answers as a list of checkbox for multiple choice answer or radio button for 1 answer only

390163
free	malloc
for example in a single threaded support library for malloc and free it would not have mutex protection for the heap as an optimization

390169
kerberos	ldap
in that case you could just do plain kerberos and not bother with ldap

390260
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the code that netadictos posted seems to work fine in ie7 firefox 3.0.5 safari 3.2.1 and google-chrome but it doesn t work in opera v9.63

390320
serializable	deserialization
for exact serializable and deserialization of exceptions you would have to use a binaryformatter which would work as long as your own exceptions are marked

390334
awt	swing
create a awt or swing frame with a stop button

390387
width	height
now i lack context why do you resize images this way instead of using width and height attributes among other questions so maybe i am missing the point

390450
disk	ram
1 - hibernation mode with ram contents written to disk system totally shut down while â œsleeping â and slower wake up due to reading the contents of ram off the hard drive

390450
disk	ram
ram is powered on while sleeping but ram contents are also written to disk before sleeping

390452
serializable	deserialization
aside from generally using a serializable mechanism that s at least somewhat tolerant of change as dacracot describes i try to set it up so that i can do some per-class tuning of the deserialization process

390496
goto	break
the break smacks more of a goto of sorts

390523
goto	break
the argument i have against using a break to get out of an endless loop is that you re essentially using the break statement as a goto

390554
versioning	upgrade
for more information about upgrade support see the versioning and edition upgrade and hardware and software requirements topics in sql server 2005 setup help or sql server 2005 books online

390554
versioning	upgrade
for more information about edition upgrade see the versioning and edition upgrade topic in sql server 2005 setup help or sql server 2005 books online

390566
goto	break
with no exits break continue or goto in the body that form is preferred because someone can read the code and understand the termination condition just by looking at the header

390566
goto	break
loops with continue are usually harder to understand than loops with break . if you want some evidence or authority to cite look no further than don knuth s famous paper on structured programming with goto statements

390585
free	malloc
remember that c doesn t need the size for free and operator new can just use malloc

390602
pop-up	dialog
for example if i were to mouse-select the file menu to open a file the os-specific gui style file-open dialog pop-up waiting for my input

while i realize that i could never possibly get to those limits especially with the cpu usage limits put in place it s nice to be about to have a bunch of pictures up on my website without worrying about running out of space

390649
postgresql	mysql
if the pricing is due to licensing costs why don t you see more host with windows and .net but with alternative databases such as postgresql or mysql available to keep the pricing to a minimum which providing basically the same functionality

390667
google-chrome	firefox
if you re using firefox try ie or google-chrome to check if that s the case

if cookies are not enabled it could be passed in a get or post although it s often better not to go there see session.use_trans_sid s note

390730
int	chars
an order could have say 100 products each product having either only a small int or 5000 chars or free text or anything in between unique only to that order

390733
httphandler	httpmodule
and second if you have for instance a web site inside the default web site you will have both web.config but the more specific will override some of the attributes of the web.config from the default web site but the ones that are not override will be there ie httphandler httpmodule the site will try to load those so you will need to add the remove tag inside the httpmodule to remove them

390740
activemq	rabbitmq
i ve been looking at xmpp activemq rabbitmq mule esb etc

390783
post	get
by default these get actions just bundle up the model and route to a corresponding view html file in the view modelname directory note that there are also create update and destroy actions that handle a post and route back to index or show

390890
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
the main idea is to have some basics within a specific realm pinned down not unlike how in elementary school an arabic number system in base 10 with the operations of add subtract multiplying and divide and place value like tens hundreds etc

390982
unix	aix	unix	solaris	solaris	aix
so if you re building a heterogeneous distributed application involving messaging code running on windows unix aix solaris linux or mac os x then tibco ems is the ticket

391024
goto	break
it s not so much the while true part that s bad but the fact that you have to break or goto out of it that is the problem

391024
goto	break
break and goto are not really acceptable methods of flow control

391066
hash	md5
other hash are still unbroken but we have to keep in mind that ressearchers concentrate their efforts on mainstream algorithm that is md5 and sha1 so unbroken hash may be unsecure aswell

391076
versioning	upgrade
however depending on the library you use and its versioning it s quite possible that later on after some upgrade you will be receiving decimal.decimal s and not two-integer tuples anymore

391096
hash	whirlpool
i use the whirlpool hash

firefox	safari
do you see the same problems in safari and firefox

391544
portrait	landscape
i ended up creating two images- one for landscape and other for the portrait mode

391575
accessor	properties
an abstract properties declaration specifies that the accessor of the properties are virtual but does not provide an actual implementation of the accessor

391589
mouse	keyboard
you need to trick emacs into thinking that the keyboard was not being used which is not as intuitive as tricking it into thinking that the mouse was used

391592
min	max
sounds like min max animations

391648
free	malloc
raii this lets you have automatic memory management you no longer have to remember to free everything you malloc

391648
boost	stl
stl boost this is the c++ class library full of useful utilities and bits

391661
httphandler	httpmodule

webkit	gecko
it supported by at least webkit and gecko

391773
width	height
in webkit the size is limited to the width and height set

391839
put	get
if the reference actually doesn t change then in practice you ll get away with it here the internal synchronization of concurrenthashmap -- and indeed the java.util.concurrentlibrary in general -- guarantees that objects put into the map are safely published to other threads

391982
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
if you re targeting browsers that support webrtc currently firefox google-chrome and opera

392016
solaris	bsd
oh and all of this has to work on windows linux bsd os x solaris and most other common platforms

392115
int	boolean
edit you can also install the spl type handling extension which gives you wrapper types for strings int floats boolean and enums

392130
accessor	properties
to determine whether a properties is static you must obtain the methodinfo for the get or set accessor by calling the getgetmethod or the getsetmethod method and examine its isstatic properties

392213
profiler	yourkit
otherwise i ve had very good experience with yourkit profiler

392225
cairngorm	puremvc	cairngorm	mate	cairngorm	flex	mate	puremvc
if you re going to be doing a flex ria app of any degree of sophistication then you ll probably be implementing the mvc pattern - ala cairngorm mate or puremvc

392243
width	height
you might consider using something like jquery to loop through all of your desired objects - outputting the name of the object like the div s id and the height and width of that item

392243
width	height
so for what it s worth i d look at jquery if i was in your position and the height and width methods

392313
pop-up	dialog
as an alternative you could pop-up the diagnostic in a dialog box

392333
multiplying	add
multiplying by a prime and add

392428
post	get
when i m in a hurry to do something real quick and dirty i just do a httpservice send call where i ve composed an http post the data is not visible in the url as it is with a get

392437
inherited	properties
it has classes and interfaces inherited access protection keywords for class members constructors statics plus some nice things that java doesn t have properties events declarative data-binding and closures

392453
width	height
the bitmap int width int height int stride pixelformat format intptr scan0 constructor for the bitmap class might be helpful

392473
folder	directory

392528
rss	feed
i did some research involving a fair number of rss feed a few months ago and the most common schema we encountered interleaved in the rss tags was dublin core which ali a mentioned

392528
rss	feed
we were most interested in the well-formed web tags for comment rss feed but the dublin core stuff is probably what you re looking for

392529
disk	ram
but then warning gratuitous manhood waving ahead my main dev box has a quad core xeon 3ghz with 12gb ram and a pair of 15k sas disk

392556
uipagecontrol	uitableview
to achieve what you are trying to do the best approach would be to use uitableview with uipagecontrol as explained in the pagecontrol sample

392561
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
to me as well as opera and google-chrome they look like ordinary script tags however to firefox and ie they dont recognize them and will not run the scripts

392586
directx	gdi
opengl allegro windows gdi and directx api support

392599
cpu	processors
the trace cache of the intel processors was conceived to store such ops to optimize the superscalar performance of the processors as the cpu executes uops not the architectural instruction-set available for execution by programs

392620
cvs	svn
using tortoisesvn 1.5.x and tortoisecvs from the testpilot site will give you all the overlays for both svn and cvs working copies

392627
interpreted-language	compiled-language
it shorter development cycles than compiled-language like c and c++ but is higher performance arguable but i ve always been anti-java p than interpreted-language like python and perl and you don t have to work with unofficial implementations like mono that may from time to time not support all of a language s features

392632
vmware	virtualbox
my work vm is currently running inside virtualbox but i have used vmware in the past

392646

it supports html textile wiki syntax markdown bbcode

392718
ant	maven
the build process can very well be managed by maven or any other ant nant tool you want

392724
shadowing	named
i think the main difference is that with shadowing you re essentially reusing the named and just ignoring the superclass use

392733
haskell	scheme
some background i m learning haskell now having earlier worked with scheme and cl and a little foray into clojure

392777
wav	riff
unfortunately windows mobile lacks a suitable splitter to decode plain .mp3 files but there is a workaround you can add a riff header to your mp3s producing mpeg-compressed wav files

392778
superclass	subclassing
a virtual method is shown to be overridden by a subclassing and calls to that method even on the superclass type or from inside code of the superclass will call the replacement implementation from the subclassing

392778
superclass	subclassing
in this case when the method is called on the superclass type the original implementation is used the new implementation is only available on the subclassing

392795

i have ported a few such engines written in c++ and c# for hosts operating on linux freebsd and also solaris on an old ultrasparc iii - yes mono still runs there

392985
atof	strtod
after looking up atof and strtod i should rephrase my statement to there shouldn t be instead of there is not .

392988
atof	strtod
atof and strtod do what you want but are very forgiving

393021
int	double
there is also the question of whether you d want the matrix to hold int double or other numerical values that may play a role in some matrix functions

393056
zlib	libpng
you can find a matrix class in the lydos.matlab library documentation which is distributed as open source project under the zlib libpng license

i see lot of example opening pop-up with jquery but don t see anything that will let me open new page in pop-up modal dialog box

393186
ncover	testdriven.net
you may need team system to get baked in coverage analysis for vs but there is always ncover comes with testdriven.net

393188
mbunit	nunit
other alternatives are xunit.net nunit and mbunit

393188
mbunit	nunit
again i can t really compare them due to lack of experience with nunit and mbunit but i believe that all three are quite stable and usable

393254
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	show	hide	fadeout
if i however i swap hide for fadeout and show for fadein then a is still fading out while b is still fading in and it looks pretty confusing

393258
abstract-class	superclass
considering that the abstract-class number is the superclass of classes

393310
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	linux
it runs on various linux distributions mac os x freebsd netbsd and ms windows

393329
interpolation	splines
most simply that would give you a polygon but interpolation splines should probably also give you nice results

393362
perl	tcl
tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb

393403
gentoo	linux
actually i have photoshop cs3 working under wine on gentoo linux

393407
post	get
surely it can be designed in binary way just like tcp protocol using flags to represents different kinds of method post get and variables http headers

393419
jdom	jibx
other alternatives could be castor jibx xmlbeans or jdom

393481
mp3	ogg	mp3	aiff	aiff	ogg

put	get
if i put this line of code in the main program and pass the connection object conn to each thread i get a programmingerror saying that sqlite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread

393563
bash	zsh
don t forget zsh as an option - your bash knowledge is relevant plus it has got some neat scripting and command-line features

393710
opera	google-chrome
then for the odd site that you have to have flash for use an alternative browser such as opera or google-chrome for which let flash be installed

393719
folder	directory
if you do not normally have the rights to write something into the c program files-folder vista will silently redirect those writes into a secret folder inside your user directory

393725

i know how to show and hide hidden files in the terminal - but is there a way to hide certain files like .ds_store when showing hidden files

393878
width	height
i m not aware of any width height attributes for the vs designer if that s what you re using

393880
cfstring	nsstring
generally an nsstring constructor does return an object that is actually of type nscfstring which is a thin wrapper around the core foundation cfstring struct

393889
actionscript	mxml
mxml is great for doing declarative layouts much easier to follow than doing everything programmatically in actionscript

393904
post	get	post	put	put	get
you might want to get rid of the extra space after the closing parenthesis this may just be a typo in your post though put in a semi-colon and return false so that it doesn t attempt to follow the link

393914
put	get
you can also name it ls as long as you put bin first in your path and use the full path to bin ls in your script so that you don t get recursive interpretation

393941
min	max
my idea is based on using min and max

393941
min	max
min 0 and max 0

393941
min	max
min 0 and max 0

393989
stdout	stderr
don t try to encode too much meaning into the exit value detailed statuses and error reports should go to stdout stderr as arkadiy suggests

393989
stdout	stderr
any detailed diagnostic information should go to logs or to stdout stderr

394009
nsstring	nsdata
if you want to load the contents of the file into memory many of the cocoa data classes such as nsstring nsdata and even nsdictionary have initwithurl methods which initialize directly with the contents of a web request

394036
folder	directory
i also need the .bat file to execute silently unless a user interaction is required - this script copies 11k+ files to folder on a networked machine and occasionally windows forgets if the destination is a file or directory and asks for the user to tell it what it is this is a whole other issue not for discussion here...needless to say i am annoyed by it

394109
postgresql	mysql
for added bonus if when you realise decide that using sqlite for any concurrent application is going to be a disaster you won t have to change your code to use mysql or postgresql or anything else

394122
int	boolean
the only field types i m using in this dataset are int strings boolean and a few tarrayfields that hold arrays of int fields

394146
inherited	subclassing
one situation that often comes up is that i have a list of objects that inherited from one class and need to be displayed in a list but each subclassing has a slightly different way of being displayed

394168
floating-point	integer
every time the parameter is a whole number integer or float it would work fine whole ints are passed back except when there is a floating-point remainder

394168
floating-point	integer
if you wonder why it breaks note that sum is an integer and a floating-point remainder could be passed back

394245
versioning	upgrade
unless the upgrade looks bad according to the above criteria it s better to go with it and if you have any problems revert to the old versioning

394253
free	malloc
pointers are the most difficult feature of the language to learn especially when you get into malloc and free

394260
inherited	subclassing
what i mean is subclassing can be described as has-a and inherited could be is-a

394282
inherited	subclassing
my understanding is that subclassing is the same as inherited so these are both is-a

394284
for-loop	loops
best way for ascii string traversing in for-loop is to check for null char in loops it self

394344
versioning	upgrade
while you don t want to upgrade just because there s a new versioning there s another consideration which is availability of the old versioning

394346
min	max
rectangle min long -90deg max long +90deg min lat +70deg max lat +80deg

394350
versioning	upgrade
i usually assume that ignoring a new versioning of a library coz it doesn t have any interesting features or improvements is a mistake because one day you ll find out that this versioning is necessary for the migration to the next versioning which you might want to upgrade to

394350
versioning	upgrade
if a lot of testing are required it is best to upgrade to the newer library at the next release major versioning of your software like when moving from v8.0 to v8.5

394376
postgresql	mysql
if you don t want to use activerecord an orm may be a bit complicated for your usage right now you can still use the ruby-mysql library or even better imho is to use the ruby dbi dbd library here which has dbd drivers for mysql postgresql out-of-the-box

394465
post	get
i m using apache + mod_wsgi to host my python application and i d like to get the post content submitted in one of the forms -however neither the environment values nor sys.stdin contains any of this data

394491
pop-up	dialog
what would be nice is if i could use the jquery dialog to pop-up a message asking if the user is sure he wants to cancel the booking

394512
cos	inverse
note that the tj x and tk x in the wolfram article i linked to used the cos and inverse cosine these are polynomials and in practice you use a recurrence formula to get the coefficients

394512
cos	sin
but the real world applications for having to write your own sin or cos functions are rare enough that you d be best off using an efficient implementation to reach a desired accuracy -- which the taylor series is not

394540
folder	dir
however i guess i could just label my root parent dir with a tag like projectnameissourcesafecheckedin and for every folder and only the parent folder i will drill in and count the lines in classes

394563
post	get
this will get passed to the tempjumptoajax.aspx page as post variable called searchtext

394580
post	get
however i recommend that you make this a post instead of a get since a cancel action has side effects and thus doesn t comply with get semantics .

394595
ienumerable	iqueryable
this little awesome project is a backport of linq ienumerable but without iqueryable and its dependencies func action etc to .net 2.0

394708
pascal	delphi
delphi or pascal there s nothing delphi-specific here

394710
smallcheck	quickcheck
moreover haskell has more tools for getting complicated code right things like quickcheck smallcheck and the static type system

394711
inline	inlining
a lot of c compilers that implement inline assembly language and a pragma to do inlining of entire functions have for many many years taken advantage of this in their library functions

394723
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to the latest versioning of f# 1.9.6.2 also known as the september ctp

394725
cvs	svn
4 svn knows how to keep deltas for binary files unlike older systems like cvs so keeping everything on your project under svn is worth doing

394763
put	get
and if i just put smallerarray.extractpiece in largerarray.extractarray i still get problems

394774
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction of a integer to a pointer means move the pointer forward backward by n elements

394802
int	chars
printf d d d sizeof chars sizeof int sizeof float

394819
int	chars
the point is sql doesn t force you to use int pseudokeys so use chars and varchar keys where appropriate

394853
ingres	oracle
i ve noticed ingres and oracle developers tend to use the first style whereas microsoft sql server users have tended to use the second but that might just be a coincidence

394906
keydown	keyup
back in the dos-days the same scancodes have been used for games because it has been the only way to detect keyup and keydown events

394940
folder	directory
the sample app has two folder in its root directory lib src

394942

redland	jena	jena	rdflib	rdflib	redland
i ve played with jena sesame boca rdflib redland and one or two others some time ago but each had its problems

394953
pull	push
the view needs your model to create the ui pull from model and to receive updates from it push by model

394966
pop-up	dialog
if you need further interaction based on the results of your initial dialog then i would consider either adding another modal dialog that you pop-up after the current one is closed with your ajax results or insert the ajax results into your main interface and deal with it there

395019
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed ie and google-chrome have a 1px border by default on the other hand firefox have a 2px border which results the textarea to be 502px instead of 500px any workarounds

395065
udp	tcp
but my programming question was whether there is a way to send tcp udp packages via php so i can knock via a webclient

this works in firefox tested in 3 opera tested in 9.6 and google-chrome tested in 1 but not in msie7 haven t tested in msie8

395150
sorting	filtering
if so then what you call implicit paging will probably be necessary as sorting and filtering over a partially obscured result set is counter-intuitive

395171
octal	decimal
forces it to be parsed as a decimal number otherwise strings beginning with 0 might be parsed as an octal number might depend on the browser used

395172
free	malloc
when managing heap-allocated memory acquired from malloc or new it is usually the responsibility of the programmer to free or delete that memory before the pointer is destroyed

395175
post	get
if you ask this question on comp.lang.javascript you ll get lots of different answers many of which disdain the commonly-used libraries one quote sometimes taken slightly out of context is richard cornford s post on c.l.js in 2007 prototype.js was written by people who don t know javascript for people

395286
client-side	server-side
client-side validation to augment the server-side validation which i would of course retain

395312
hide	show
the usercontrol would pass through most of the properties and events but in response to the .readonly property it would hide the combobox control and show a readonly edit box instead

395317
junit	mockito
i am using junit 4.1 and in the same test i am using mockito

395339
rss	feed
to parse the documents try something with feed rss or atom in the name

395343
many-to-many	many-to-one
edit fixed to be many-to-many instead of many-to-one

395557
pascal	delphi
i know someone who has a one-man company developing applications in delphi and pascal

395577
width	margin
if is a block element set left and right margin to auto and remember to set a width block elements default to take all available horizontal space unless a width is stated explicitly

395649
opera	safari
it is then you know how to write the most compatible style possible in the first place thus saving all the time in degugging and rarely have any problems with any of the major modern browsers ie6 ie7 ff2 ff3 opera 9 safari 3 win mac

395649
opera	safari
other than that ff2 ff3 opera 9 safari win mac ie7 ie8 are relatively similar in the rendering engine at least with much less bugs than it has with ie6

395650
hash	md5
now this can sorta be done with get parameters like an md5 hash token but i m interested in url mapping as a general solution to many problems

395653
post	get
if you get a chance please up vote ima s post

395668
lz77	lzw
if you cannot predict which headers will be used you may need to use lzw or lz77 or another method which looks at the data which has already gone through to find the data it can express in an especially compact form

395669
post	put
i put a step-by-step guide in a blog post that might help installing django with mysql on mac os x

395679
jlabel	jtextpane
i m assuming you re rendering text to an arbitrary component via paintcomponent rather than trying to modify the color of text in a jtextpane jlabel or other pre-existing widget

395688
post	get
you d usually have a single file that would include the header footer and based on some incoming get or post params you d also include some other pages that would generate or display the content

awt	swing
have you ever used swing awt

395860

if the parent is killed children become children of the init process that has the process id 1 and is launched as the first user process by the kernel

395892
post	get
the reason i ask is i am very confused after sifting through different articles and post expressing a different method and eventually hitting a 650 page document on wcf security best practices i am just uncertain which approach is the best to take and how to get started on implementation given my scenario

395892
hash	hmac
this is the point at which i tried to research more on how to do this using a hmac hash with the authorization http header but could not find much on google

395921
subnet	packets
if there are no requirements on what the packets should contain if any arp packets will do then you can obviously send an arp request if you re on an ethernet network simply by trying to send something to any ip on your own subnet ensuring beforehand that the destination ip is not in the arp cache by running an external arp -d tar.get.ip.address command but this will probably not be what you want

395960
pylons	cherrypy
python-based solutions like cherrypy or pylons in what context are application servers a better alternative to php

395968
gridview	formview
what are the similarities and differences between gridview detailview formview

395970
pylons	cherrypy
there are several products in php which fill the same space as cherrypy or pylons

i was about to make the same remark as wouter use png modern format which is highly compressed as opposed to bmp lossless as opposed to jpeg and full color and with several level of transparency as opposed to gif

396046
hex	binary
with some experimentation with a very large dictionary i found no word that exceeded a frequency count of 9 for any letter so the signature can be represented as a string of numbers 0..9 the size could be easily halved by packing into bytes as hex and further reduced by binary encoding the number but i didn t bother with any of this so far

396083
versioning	upgrade
however when i install any versioning of sql server 2005 it fails for all the important things like the database engine with the message that i should upgrade my windows installer to a newer versioning

396114
tolower	toupper	tolower	uppercase	toupper	uppercase
it is actually better to convert the string to uppercase toupper as that has been apparently there are further optimizations that the just-in-time compiler can do as when compared to the tolower

396135
switching	screens
older versions of windows had a splash screens for the mmc control panel and the s switching would supress it

396151
int	double
when foldl is used the sum is immediately calculated so applying sum to an infinite list will just run forever and most likely in constant space if youâ re using things like int s double s float s

396165
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
when i tested firefox ie and google-chrome was trying to download the file and asked the user where to store it opera displayed the file

396171
firefox	safari
when logged in try to click one of rows avboka link this is where a dialog is shown in firefox and safari

396184
superclass	subclassing
if you need to access a subclassing from a superclass then there s a good chance that your model is broken it should be one class

396192
superclass	subclassing
it allows a subclassing to defer to it s superclass

396192
super	extends	superclass	subclassing
however in all subclassing situations you ll make use of super to extends a superclass

using preferably jscript but vbscript will also do how does one walk a dll obtaining the properties and their attributes contained therein

396346

button	checkbox
not only that they mostly relied silently on an estimated height of the radio button checkbox but they also behaved differently in different browsers

396495
vim	emacs
out of all the features in use in modern text editors initial research seems to indicate that this is one feature that both emacs and vim do not actually support

396495
vim	emacs
question has anyone ever seen or implemented this feature in either emacs vim or both

396502
opera	firefox
the following works in firefox and opera sorry i do not have access to other browsers at the moment

396517
vim	emacs
i don t think this feature has a direct analogue in either emacs or vim which is not to say that everything achievable with this feature is not possible in some fashion with the two old-school editors

396517
vim	emacs
and like most things emacs and vim power-users would probably be able to achieve such a task exceedingly quickly even if mere mortals like myself could spend five minutes figuring out the correct grep search and replace with appropriate back-references for example

396569
swt	swing
because i m not very fond of writing webapps i plan to build a gui swing or swt that would only manage pojos do some reporting and invoke methods from the container

396573
kate	kde
kate kde advanced text editor

396601
ienumerable	ilist
i would choose between ilist and ienumerable and wouldn t consider array at all

396601
ienumerable	ilist
note that ienumerable does not have count or length property except as an extension method while array and ilist do

396685
getter	setter
somewhat similar to what you ve described for testing the presence of a default constructor i ve used testutil to automatically test getter and setter

396688
jobs	cron
use craken rake centric cron jobs

396717
put	get
i put forth the effort because coding in python is much more enjoyable to me than php and after you get the apache config right once you never really have to mess with it again

396723
put	get
then on my controller i just had to get the parameters and put them in the this- data so my function would continue as usual

396755
wordpress	vbulletin
and after that it s a matter of looking in the footer for tip-offs such as powered by wordpress or vbulletin etc

396764
ienumerable	icollection
i would also return a read-only icollection or ienumerable unless you ve got some specific reason not to.

396773
packets	multicast
one caveat for multicast packets however is if there are any wifi connections the access point will use the slowest possible bit rate for the multicast packets and requires acks from all clients even those who are not part of the multicast group

396782
button	checkbox
yet people who argue that the user s don t read anything will often suggest putting bits of long dry explanatory text to help users who are confused by some random poor design decision like using checkbox for something that should be radio button because you can only select one

396815
post	get	post	put	put	get
if the last option i guess you d have to have some sort of login method or something on the service something that would send an okay you re logged if you pass in this hash value with future requests. but not all rest clients will be expecting to receive cookies just simple get put post delete requests without any state

396830
cvs	svn
i would like to move them to a versioning system cvs svn or any other tool but the catch is i am not their senior so i need a carrot for them to start using this

396838

unfortunately since this has 2 methods gethashcode and equals there is no direct delegate version of this except perhaps or

397443
lisp	scheme
it s good in game ais because of its nice list manipulations at least in lisp and scheme and for mathematical computations because of its syntax

397443
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
scheme lisp and haskell have a syntax that makes mathematical computations easy to read

397796
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
firefox and microsoft and opera and google-chrome would all use different methods my guess is they arrays not associative arrays use something like stl s std vector

397801
punctuation	words
instead of matching foreign language characters there are so many of them in many different ascii ranges you might be better off looking for the characters that delineate your words - spaces quotation marks and other punctuation

397933
gmail	hotmail
when you register one of them for example twitter it says why dont you invite your friends from hotmail or yahoo or gmail

397965
ant	cruisecontrol
the best thing you can use is cruisecontrol + ant + phpundercontrol + phpunit + php_codesniffer + xdebug

subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
for addition subtraction multiplication shift left the logical operations equality

397999
nscolorwell	nsimageview

ironruby	ironpython
about the monstrous hybrid there s no such thing it s just a very active port like ironruby or ironpython in .net land

398156
post	put
eventually specific business action edit lock etc. could be embedded in the uri if create post or update put alone do not serve the purpose

398192
inherited	properties
your idea of doing removefieldref and fieldref it right back in would be the same as setting the properties required and default value through the interface for the document or inherited content types though your idea would help if we are building custom content types

398221
ubuntu	debian
if you are running debian or ubuntu you will soon find out that you will not be able to live on the bleeding edge like many cpan module authors seem to do

398231

firefox	safari
trying to debug with eclipse i see that when using safari it is the doget method that is called while when using firefox is dopost

the real world answer is that people who put their java libraries under lgpl most likely intend for them to be linked to redistributed within commercial java applications so it s extremely unlikely that you will get into any trouble if you simply redistribute those unmodified libraries with your application

folder	directory
a simple dummy task might be to create a directory in the temporary folder

398476
folder	directory
in my template folder i make a directory called html and then inside that a new directory called mod___mainmenu and then a make copy the default.php file from the existing mod_mainmenu folder from the modules directory

398485
width	height
i ve run into the problem of .net controls size height and width are silently limited to a signed 16 bit integer 32 767

398549
cpu	processors
see at some point in the near future processors speed will not be able to increase using the same cpu technology

398579
lisp	scheme
so my recommendation would be to read first the little schemer then its a couple of hours and its worth it if you decide lisp or scheme or whatever dialect is not what you where looking for you will still have a very fun new way of thinking about recursion

398611
lisp	scheme
it uses scheme which is a nice and clean dialect of lisp

398676
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i ve run fiddler and windows network monitor and verified that all links on the page are it works fine on ie 7 8 safari opera and google-chrome

398678
wan	multicast
as for the topic we have not much experience with multicast over wan however my feeling is that pgm + wan + high volume of data would lead to retransmission storms

398706
bmp	png
i tried octave but for some reason it can t even load a png bmp or anything other than 1 specific format

398718
postgresql	mysql
i can say that both mysql and postgresql will work as well as any dbms in most situations

398733
postgresql	mysql
if you have a choice between postgresql and mysql i say go the postgresql route because if you get deep into stored proc and function development postgresql will give you a much more robust feature set to work from

398778
google-chrome	firefox
i have ie 7.0 firefox 3.0 and google-chrome 1.0

398811
trie	tree
and that was wikipedia s comments on the tree not trie

398818
put	get
this bug is rarely put to the test one probable reason it didn t get fixed in vista sp1

398846
int	double
2 the code return math.round n precision precision .tostring does not compile due to an ambiguity between math.round double int and math.round decimal int

398899
memset	malloc
once the pointer actually pointers to something via malloc or by assigning to it the address of a struct my_t then you can properly memset it

398900
lisp	scheme
first of all scheme and common lisp are fairly different in rather deep ways like scoping

398910
unix	aix
i vaguely remember from my unix aix and hpux i ll admit i ve never used shared memory in linux days that deletion simply marks the block as no longer attachable by new clients

398918
versioning	upgrade
what you need to do is make sure all subsequent installers upgrade properly over the previous versioning so that different folders are not required

398959
daemons	systemd
one written in c that makes the interface to the operating systemd and the other in java that provides the daemons api

398976
post	put
once you put the fear of unemployment one the table and i d tell them that you are writing up the failure to communicate for each one then require them to post plans for immediate communication improvement plus detailed timelines for fixing the mess by the end of the week

398996
ienumerable	ienumerator
however the most common meaning of this is something that implements ienumerable returning an ienumerator

399023
post	get
using httpscoop i ve seen that apparently safari fires post followed by get when it gets the response

399023
post	get
i think however that it actually fires both requests at the same time since the date+time of the two responses is the same for both post and get

399023
rss	feed
the response is a rss feed and has the http 1.1 200 ok code

399023
post	get
the second get asks for the same request url of the post but the body is 0 bytes it has of course no get parameters and the answer is wrong because of the missing parameters

399030
16-bit	64bit
in practice pointers will be size 2 on a 16-bit system if you can find one 4 on a 32-bit system and 8 on a 64bit system but there s nothing to be gained in relying on a given size

399031
installation	upgrade
advertise your msi in active directory installation and upgrade does not require administrative privileges

399039
postgresql	mysql
i have used mysql and postgresql for more than five years on and off and both are good

399039
postgresql	mysql
do note however that mysql vs postgresql is one of the holy flamewars like linux vs windows etc

399039
postgresql	mysql
of the two postgresql has for a long time been considered more robust and mysql - faster however both advantages are by now somewhat debatable

399122
int	chars
there have been machines where sizeof int will be one value probably 4 but where sizeof chars is larger

399133
cvs	svn
this seems happen with shared repos imported from svn or cvs

399151
width	height
taking a look at the exported final product the xaml produced is wrapped in a canvas whether or not i select that option in export with hard-coded left top attached properties and width height

399163
int	double
the name long double is likely just down the same tradition as the long int vs

399180
width	height
i have an application where users can upload video files of any size and i d like to be able to determine the the height width of a flash video file flv or f4v from a php script so that i can size the player appropriately

399189
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
finally with linq in c# you now get much better functionality for working with collections aggregates grouping sorting filtering etc that may have given datasets the advantage

399281
postgresql	mysql
bottom line - mysql used to be a good option but consider sql server express and postgresql as better current alternatives

399284
folder	directory
the text of the email is stored in individual files in the respective mailbox folder directory

399339
doc	rtf
i need a doc to rtf converter that will run from the command line and from within a perl script i know i ll need to use system to run the converter

399343
explode	implode
anyway he pointed to article about f# that have two functions for string manipulation explode and implode

399390
post	get
you can get one up and running very easily using post fix enabler or if you don t mind the command line use macports to install postfix

399402
width	height
since you ve got the image view set to aspect fit you can simply take the height and width of the image view along with the height and width of the original image and calculate the height and width of the scaled image

399428
put	get
try to get something put together that works even if its horribly inefficient and clunky then really spend some time looking at how things can be improved

399431
pop-up	dialog
this program creates a form window and immediately creates another non-gui thread which wants to pop-up a modal dialog window on the form s gui thread

399445
minimum	max
minimum coupling and max coherence makes it easy to cut out defective parts

399447
getter	setter
would i still need to create getter and setter methods for each attribute like so

399455
getter	setter
a similar script can readily take a sql table statement and convert it in to a java bean at least the base members that then your ide converts in to a flurry of getter setter

399511
content-disposition	content-type
not precisely but you can do it by hyperlinking to the img file and setting the content-type and content-disposition headers in the server response

399530
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
theelements sample code gives a basic idea of how to use uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller but the example does not discuss passing information from child controller to parent

399530
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in my case i have a uitabbarcontroller one of the tab shows a uinavigationcontroller with + on the top right corner or navigation bar

399616
mouse	keyboard
for a scripting utility i need to be able to record a series of keyboard and mouse events that occur when an application has focus

399669
versioning	upgrade
i m using subversion 1.4.6 and i cannot upgrade to versioning 1.5 right now

399697
draggable	droppable
you may also want to look into jquery ui s draggable droppable and sortable plugins

399715
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
for your case these would be the uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

399737
srp	principles
srp the single responsibility principles a class should have only one reason to change

399737
ocp	principles
ocp the open-closed principles software entities classes packages methods etc. should be open for extension but closed for modification

399737
lsp	principles
lsp the liskov substition principles subtypes must be substitutable for their base types

399762
width	height
the child item should fill all available space if no specific width height are set

399762
width	height
alternatively you can set the width and height of the control to stretched however i think using the grid.sharedscopesize is a more elegant way to achieving the same effect

399787
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
all other browsers work perfectly firefox safari and opera on my mac and firefox on pc

399808
debian	linux
a lot of gnu linux packagers make use of this debian rules and others

399815
ubuntu	linux
now i switched to linux ubuntu to see how it works out there and strangely the stars in the table cell are layed out perfectly while the stars on the context menu don t even show up

399850
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ will let you get away with a lot on the default level

399850
g++	gcc
i just wanted to point out that i don t use -werror but i do understand it s utility on gcc g++ because i use

399909
subtraction	addition
you can also do this without addition and subtraction
