2 what fromintegral does is convert any integral type like int int64 or int into any num in this case double

8903099
int	double
the end result is an array indexed by int int with values of type double which is presumably what you wanted in the first place

8903099
int	double
2 as for why int and double are picked rather than any other integral or fractions this is due to haskell s defaulting mechanism

8903099
int	double
basically if you have an ambiguous numeric type in your program it s first tried with int and if that doesn t work because the type has to be fractions which as we ve established int isn t double is tried instead

there has been some good and informative responses here but the point of lisp and prolog has either been missed marginalized or not emphasized enough

8915031
lisp	prolog
lisp and then later prolog emerged in an era when the main ai research revolved around symbolic processing

8915031

width	height
for example if you call frm.grid_propagate false and then set the widget and height of frm the width and height will be honored

8915298
distance	polygons
the general ideas seems to be that you pass a distance vector calculated in the vertex shader to each fragment in the fragment shader which it can use to determine what brightness to draw the wireframe line at based on its position within a polygons

8915342

onresume	onpause
you can always handle saving the state of the activity in onpause or ondestroy and simply restore state the next time the user opens the activity in onresume

8915457
implements	extends
i would suggest to make an interface shape which provides a basic blue print about the shape of the geometric shape and all your classes implements the shape interface and create a separate class screenshape or abstract class which all of your classes will extends and provide the method for displaying on screen in the screenshape class

xslt	xquery
that tells the outer xquery to treat those as literal curly brackets in the xslt

8915790
xslt	xquery
the ability to evaluate xquery to dynamically create xslt is pretty powerful but does impose a little more cognitive overhead

8915805
pop-up	dialog
so when we click on the cell a cellactivation operation in the code behind for that view is called which then calls a method in the view model to .requestnavigate to the view that is registered for the secondary pop-up region thus launching what appears to be a dialog over the existing application

8915805
children	parent

8916025
onmouseover	onclick
you ll simply want to look at the onmouseover || onclick event and when the thumbnail image is moused over || clicked you ll need to get some base coordinates and then show a div with a larger image hovering over the smaller image you should use 2 images one small and one large and you should probably create them on disk at upload or image creation file streaming works too but lacks efficiency if they re static images cache

8916025
hide	show
to place the larger image s location correctly you re either going to want to add a div dynamically who s content is the large image or show hide a hidden div which already has the larger image loaded this way images could already be loaded however it will load all even if not needed again how much time you can hide these in the dom somewhere

int	double
since excel uses double for currency time values int and all other numbers its not usually neccessary to find out how the number is formatted for excel display purposes just add the values up. as double

8916663
maven	pom.xml
see the maven documentation on the distributionmanagement section of your pom.xml

8916663
nexus	artifactory
i should think this information also applies to artifactory considering nexus is the reference maven repository manager

8916669
trac	bugzilla
off the top of my head bugzilla fogbugz trac and jira all do

8916693
hide	show
as well as show hide traffic without loading the map again..

8916723
cpu	hyperthreading
can two processes simultaneously run on one cpu core which has hyperthreading

8916723
cpu	hyperthreading
1 a hyperthreading technology enabled cpu core has two set of cpu state and interrupt logic

8916723
cpu	hyperthreading
3 if the cpu state maps to process state i believe marc is correct that multiple process application can even benefit more from hyperthreading technology

8916789
cpu	hyperthreading
no a hyperthreading cpu core still only has a single execution pipeline

8916789
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading was intended to allow the cpu to continue executing one thread while another thread was stalled waiting for a resource or other operation to complete without leaving too many stages of the pipeline empty and useless

8916789
cpu	hyperthreading
this goes back to the pentium 4 days with its absurdly long pipeline - a stall was essentially catastrophic for efficiency and throughput and hyperthreading allowed intel to keep the cpu busy doing other things while it cleaned up from the stall

8916791
width	height
this lets you set any of the shape properties directly positional coordinates height width and radius in the case of a rectangle

8916791
subtract	add
as best i can tell if you want to move it using relative positioning instead of absolute you just have to add or subtract from it s current position which can be gotten from the obj.shape properties pretty simple

8916842
cvs	svn
exclude bin gen from svn cvs

8916931
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this works great in firefox opera google-chrome

alternatively you could just upload the dll to your bin directory and copy over the new view to the correct views folder

8916972
wordpress	joomla
in joomla in wordpress they are called replacement tags

8916972
wordpress	joomla
i ve never done joomla pluggins although i did some modules and components but i did shorttags in wordpress and my guess is they work the exact same way

8916972
wordpress	joomla
the engine joomla or wordpress detects or and parses the content into something that can be transfered to your pluggin and then your pluggin can act on it

8917041
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
i removed the animated slidedown and slideup function calls for the less cpu intensive show and hide

8917083
width	height
i ve sized my string to maximize height fit 1 line so that any excessive width is cutoff as in mid-glyph which linebreakmode uilinebreakmodeclip should do

8917140
portrait	landscape
it is possible to set the orientation of the keyboard in landscape mode to portrait

8917140
portrait	landscape
my activity is always in landscape mode but if the keyboar appears only the keyboard should be in a portrait mode

8917198
public	protected
so a simple answer to your question is yes a child can access its parent s public and protected instance variables

8917263
memcached	apc
can you install a full text search engine like sphinx or solr and also caching to memory with memcached or apc will definitly help you

8917276
firefox	safari
however it loads just fine in firefox safari and on the iphone

8917321
integer	unsigned
in an unsigned integer the values 0 through 2 n-1 - 1 are all encoded using the standard base-two representation

8917322
fontfamily	font-size
to be clear all the minifiers i know of like yui compressor only remove white-space and possibly join a few properties like fontfamily and font-size into font

8917382
pop-up	dialog
the dialog element is a really good pop-up overlay provider

8917396
gitolite	gitosis
systems that wrap git like github gitolite or gitosis have ways that track that kind of information

8917405
multiplying	modulo
multiplying and taking the modulo for a slightly larger mod i wanted to decrease the likelihood that the result was zero

8917412

you can change the property s value to hide or show the status bar while your app is running

8917461
qtcpsocket	qtcpserver
i am trying to do this using qt qtcpsocket and qtcpserver

8917532
int	boolean
i have a column represented as int in the backend sqlite but with a boolean interpretation in the nhibernate mapping

8917579
debian	linux
i don t believe there is a way of getting that installed and working on debian linux

8917587
pull	push
we have our own git repository using gitolite which we ve easily customized to handle the push and pull duties described in larsman s answers - unfortunately since you re on a shared host this might not be the ideal solution for you

8917588
tetris	pong
but if you can make pong you can make tetris with some work

8917635
svg	vml
you can also download and tweak the svg vml xslt and test it in ie like this

8917647
isotope	masonry
isotope another jquery plugin that looks similar to masonry could probably do the same job as masonry but i haven t tested yet

8917705
sorting	filtering
the grid must perform well by passing the filtering paging and sorting parameters to nhibernate

8917725
uiview	cashapelayer
instead of having uiview with custom drawing your can add cashapelayer object to your view s layer

8917780
hide	show
when using nimbus just show and hide the popup by repeatedly clicking the toggle button and you will see what i mean

8917781
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
if you downloaded a java program from github it s nearly certain that it comes with a build.xml for use with ant or a pom.xml for use with maven or some other file for use with some other build tool

8917794
hash	md5
use a one-way hash like md5 etc

8917800
openssl	m2crypto
i ve rebuilt both openssl and m2crypto and made certain that no other copies exist on the build machine a vm. i ve traced through python itself and cannot discover why it will not load the _d.pyd

8917814
gridview	objectdatasource
my aspx page has a gridview whos datasourceid is set to an objectdatasource

8917824
testunit	cucumber
i want to map a large number of tests rspec testunit cucumber selenium etc. over a very large ror code base and look for intersections and overlaps in an attempt to reduce the number of tests being run while maintaining code coverage

8917837
salt	md5
i d just use a salt md5

8917847
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
supporting browsers are ie safari firefox google-chrome

8917858
int	double
now that we have a suitable allocator we can go back to our original template class and replace int with double

8917897
integer	fractions
so when you do a b this fails way before it even realises that int and integer are not instances of fractions â since takes two arguments of the same type it can t possibly work

8917912
google-chrome	firefox
it should be okay in firefox google-chrome and ie9

8917959
cashapelayer	cagradientlayer
if you really just want a simple shape that can be drawn by a core animation layer like cashapelayer or cagradientlayer you should just use a core animation layer and a cabasicanimation to animate the layer s frame

8917971
int	chars
but what happens if the the columns one wants to search on is not a factor or chars but rather is an int

8917980
hide	show
the wizard has an area where the user chooses one of two options which show and hide a div with other input elements

8917985
webclient	httpwebrequest
it is much easier to use webclient instead of httpwebrequest

8918008
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested the following css in google-chrome safari firefox sorry no immediate ie access

8918112
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
stringcomparer is a class which implements comparison interfaces like icomparer iequalitycomparer so that it can be used to compare two strings

8918134
int	chars	int	double
simple types bool byte chars short int long float and double

8918183
g++	gcc
4 the compiler g++ gcc compiles this automatically and the overall program structure calls the newly created executable file

8918188
flot	jqchart	jqplot	jqchart	jqplot	flot
i created chart with jquery plugin jqplot and flot but jqchart doesn t show correctly

8918188
flot	jqchart
with that code flot draws chart with line and jqchart draws chart but there is not line it s empty chart

8918191
maven	pom.xml
this means that a plain maven pom.xml file with no additional dependencies will build a javafx application

8918191
ant	maven
however i have successfully built javafx 2.0 projects using maven in the past by using a system scoped dependency on the jfxrt.jar and optionally invoking the javafx ant tasks from maven

8918191
maven	pom.xml
after running the above command add the dependency to the jfxrt.jar file to your maven pom.xml and your project compilation should resolve all javafx api references

8918191
ant	pom.xml
if you extend the javafx application class and you want your application packaged for deployment via webstart browser embedding or as a javafx installation aware clickable jar then you should adapt your pom.xml file to execute the relevant javafx 2.0 ant tasks - demonstrates such an adaption

8918214
min	max
therefore i have to find the max and min of each column

8918238
post	get
i know the code can certainly be optimized this is just a first run through to get everything working but i think its good enough to post as an answer for now

8918317
equals	compareto
this link provides a good explanation between equals compareto .

8918384
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i have no issues with this in firefox google-chrome or opera

8918415
min	max
the answer for posterity is that in this scenario the values should be set on the input element s min and max attributes

8918489
rss	feed
but with this setup good luck accessing the rss feed

8918489
rss	feed
this script will live on an internal webserver so you can get your rss feed internally so users that use outlook like the owner can view it when connected to the network

8918513
google-chrome	safari
but there is one bad bad thing the rendering of central part of border-image is a kelly hell there is a difference not only between webkit and mozilla but even between the safari and google-chrome so i added a lot of hacks there

8918530
inherited	subclassing
model inherited won t automatically return the subclassing instances -- if you ask the orm for foos it will give you foos

8918532
nsstring	nsdata
i understand why when going from nsdata to nsstring you need to specify encoding

8918532
nsstring	nsdata
however i m finding it frustrating how the reverse nsstring to nsdata needs to have an encoding specified

8918532
nsstring	nsdata
so i just wanted to ask if the following is correct when converting nsstring to nsdata

8918620
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this needs to work in all the major browsers google-chrome firefox ie safari

8918625
children	parent
especially when we want to compute children offsprings of crossover parent like here

8918651
mouse	trackpad
when you use the actual click of the trackpad or a mouse button the time between mouse_down and click is long enough for the function to be called once

8918663
int	double
basically - is the current way that i am creating properties completely threadsafe for both int and double

8918693
gridview	rowdatabound
you are inserting your data into the database inside your gridview s rowdatabound event - this is executing every time a datarow is being bound

8918737
qgraphicsview	qscrollarea
instead of a list or qscrollarea i am just going to take a qgraphicsview and paint my own objects into it

8918792
textview	imageview
traditionally one uses the viewholder pattern to hold the subviews of a list item textview imageview etc not data setting and getting the score from within the holder - what s happening is that you set the value to zero at position zero scroll down to the 6th item on a 5-item screen the 0th item gets re-used for position 6 and it pulls the existing value from the holder attached to that listitem in this case a 0

8918822
pull	push
if we were to use the changegroup hook then it would cause cyclic behaviors because the hook is run during a pull push or unbundle

8918824
free	malloc
similarly you might ask why you can t use malloc to allocate memory placement new to construct an object and then delete to delete and free the memory

8918824
free	malloc
the reason is that you must match malloc and free not malloc and delete

8918929
button	checkbox
it also supports all form element types including checkbox and radio button

8918946
apache	nginx
this machine runs our development environment nginx apache php mysql memcache gearman etc which is unruly to get installed on a non linux environment

8918954
typedef	struct
as the other answers say it defines two typedef one named work_t that refers to struct work_tag and another name work_p that refers to

8918954
typedef	struct
if you want to define a name for a truly opaque type where code that uses it doesn t take advantage of the fact that it s a struct or a pointer a typedef is a good solution

8918954
typedef	struct
c does not. note that if a struct work contains a pointer to another struct work you can t use the typedef name inside the definition

8918956
htmlcleaner	jsoup
for that take a look at htmlcleaner jsoup html parsers

8918975
google-chrome	firefox
creating a calculator-like dialog i noticed that quickly clicking on a button in ie will not fire the click event twice google-chrome firefox work as expected but rather throws the click event then a double-click event

8918987
portrait	landscape
note the device will reserve 20px to display a soft key menu making the effective portrait resolution 1004px high x 600px wide and the effective landscape resolution 580px high x 1024px wide

8919007
int	chars
this can also happen if column names are int 1 n even though they are stored as chars

8919020
translation	localization
as i mentioned before localization in windows phone works fine but in silverlight application labels are not translation

8919028
put	get
put it all back together and we get â which is of course the same thing as

8919040
width	height
i have 2 divs on which is set to be 60 width but no setting for the height this is the parent

8919040
width	height
inside of it i have a div which is set to be 15 width 100 height not working and float left

8919049
maven	m2e
therefore in you eclipse indigo you have installed m2e whereas your old maven projects in the older eclipse version were created with m2e according to your right-click description

8919049
maven	m2e
unfortunately with the move of the project the namespace has changed from org.maven.ide.eclipse to org.eclipse.m2e.core and old maven projects created with m2e are not immediately recognised as maven projects in m2e

8919053
implements	extends
i am extends fragment and implements loadermanager.callbacks within my grid fragment class

8919069
flyway	liquibase
both flyway and liquibase sit at the dataaccess layer

8919069
flyway	liquibase
neither flyway nor liquibase impose restrictions on the kind of remoting technology being used

8919076
width	height
for example the element in the above code has its width and height explicitly set

8919102
sudoers	visudo
there s a way edit etc sudoers visudo and locate the defaults requiretty part man sudoers

8919138
flyway	liquibase
both flyway and liquibase can deal with dml

8919223
rss	feed
i need the loop to look through an rss feed and display 20 items but not spit out non-object errors if there is less than 20 items

8919236
google-chrome	firefox
when the buttons are given to the browser tested in google-chrome and firefox the yes button value is being turned to blank null

8919246
post	get
you will get the id of the new photo from the fb.api me photos post params callbackfn

8919282
jdk1.6	jdk6
however java xml datatype with the actual source found in java jdk6 src.zip which is associated with the jdk1.6 rt.jar of the library path eclipse

8919292
centos	linux
we are using centos linux

8919315
post	get
however the only way to get at the post parameters is with server-side code and cannot be done clientside

8919317
uiview	calayer
every uiview is backed by a calayer so any transforms you apply to your view.transform property directly will be very fast

8919353
post	put
what this plugin does is it will put a read more... link for each post of the blog page after the first image and the first paragraph

8919368
aiff	riff
by the way did you know djvu rmff aiff riff and many other formats are iff or slight variations

8919403
websphere	ibm
when i run the command opt ibm websphere appserver bin . dumpnamespace.sh

8919411
width	height
i define my view with width height 100 and use vertical layout

8919445
udp	tcp
should i used tcp or udp as a protocol to send variable packets over a lan network from my laptop using labview program to a crio using java

8919462
for-loop	loops
if you want to do the same thing to each of the students you can use a for-loop or a foreach loops

8919468
put	get
for instance when you call put or get or qsize etc does it lock then do some processing then release the lock

8919487
googletest	gmock
i am new to c++ primarily a c developer and very new to gmock and googletest so forgive me if this is answered elsewhere and i didn t understand the answer

8919498
button	checkbox
php sends only a value when the checkbox radio button is selected

8919523
postgresql	mysql
there is no limit 1 condition thats mysql postgresql in oracle you need to specify

8919581
put	get
thus the methods put get will use locks no matter how many threads exist in your program

8919585
superclass	subclassing
there will be a one-to-one relationship between the superclass entity and each of the subclassing entities

8919629
profiling	instrumentation
have you verified with instrumentation new relic the ruby profiling and other tools that this second lookup is really what is killing your performance

8919632
getter	setter
you will also need class with getter and setter method in order to convert db elements into objects.like in the above code gettext is our getter method which is getting elements from database and returning it here

8919655
instances	transient
so i will be refactoring my app to now make these simple instances methods on the sub-class for my managedobject entity and just return the results as i can see no real benefit to making them transient properties

8919655
getter	setter	persistent	transient
one that is transient and is the true representation of your object for which you write getter and setter and another that is most likely a binary data type that is only used internally by the core data entity sub-class for persistent the other objects value s in a storage object

8919656
onresume	onpause
because of this i really need to make sure that the onresume and onpause events are handled correctly

8919656
onresume	onpause
my assumption is that one of the events onpause or onresume is not being run so the accelerometer is being registered twice or unregistered twice

8919694
width	height
i m using the absolute.layoutparams method to give width and height to them but i get deprecation warnings

8919713
keydown	keyup
you re already listening on keydown and keyup events - there s nothing else you can do unfortunately

8919723
width	height
i want to have a element on my website that i would like to be 100 height and width of the window even after resizing

8919767
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox this works fine but in google-chrome not all of the elements are being updated to reflect the new padding

8919776
width	text-align
i have a problem with the text-align justify inside a paragraph with format and fixed width because i want the paragraph text in html to appear totally justified like it would happen with a ms word file

8919824
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i have a qtableview that i implemented with my own model subclassed from qabstracttablemodel

8919842
width	height
so you need to make sure that all the elements above your div also have a width height of 100

8919916
folder	directory
thats just a simple dos or batch command to make a directory with the date and to move all .png files into that folder

8919931
getter	setter
pocos in the c# client are conventionally serialized using servicestack s fast json serializer where only properties with public getter are serialized and public setter to get de-serialized back

8919946
client-side	server-side
however while you can use a combination of server-side and client-side scripting to make this work this would probably become very slow and use a lot of bandwidth

8920002
client-side	server-side
configure the client to use that client-side certificate to identify itself and only accept the one server-side certificate you installed on your server for that part of it

8920012
filtering	grouping
i realize that my example is very simple but in real life it can become more complicated involving filtering or grouping

8920050
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a dialog box

8920061
rmdir	mkdir
the build process removed the directory rmdir s u target and then recreated it mkdir u target

8920061
rmdir	mkdir
the build process unfortunately checked only for rmdir failure not mkdir

8920061
folder	directory
changing the current directory finally deleted the folder and another go at build set everything right

8920077
put	get
i can get the list to work as intended if i put it in the footer after the document has been executed but i don t want it there

8920085
uninstall	upgrade
i also had to uninstall an m2e scm connector in order to upgrade it

8920085
maven	m2e
claszen most of the info is here m2e compatible maven plugins

8920085
maven	m2e
execution information is defined in a file - src main resources meta-inf m2e lifecycle-mapping-metadata.xml - see m2e compatible maven plugins for format

8920092
int	chars
i ve tried converting to a string and gather that chars and have this ridiculous function that tests the int length number of digits and adds just the end digit to another list and some comparison code

8920096
width	height
also note that the proper way to set the width and height of a view is to do so via the layoutparams

8920096
width	height
you shouldn t have to set the width and height manually as you do in your second example

8920105
libs	buildpath
basically you need to add your libs via project property java buildpath project

8920112
x86	64bit
running this on a 64bit windows the program is compiled for target x86 though

8920120
accessor	properties
this allows you to access properties are are not legal for the dot accessor notation

8920123
jruby	mri
jruby is faster than 1.9 mri matz ruby interpreter the standard in certain areas

8920152
move	drag
when they are on top of each other at 0 0 even if i try to drag the handle attached with the .sidecar2 black one it always move the slider with red attached to it

8920183
atomic	interlocked
if you need to write to a pointer which is shared between threads use either or the not yet official gccs atomic intrinsics or windows interlocked or wrap all accesses to that pointer in mutexes

8920191
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i can confirm with nslog that the vc is calling viewdidload and viewdidappear but the map property of the vc is null

8920256
punctuation	words
i think my answer s caveat about notion of one words in the original answer covers problems with punctuation solution choose a different regular expression but the zero and one words cases are a problem

8920270
sudo	passwd
the reason i m using echo passwd | sudo -s for most of the commands is because this script is being run from the script menu in mac os x

8920270
sudo	passwd
the terminal window does not open to address sudo passwd prompts

8920276
keydown	keyup
what i am doing is using keydown and keyup events inside a winform

8920276
keydown	keyup
the idea is to start emiting a frequency through the speaker in keydown event and then stop it in keyup event

8920351
for-loop	arrays
it s a bit tricky since you ll need to use two indexes but only a single for-loop one index for iterating over the input arrays and the other for iterating over the output arrays - the index for the input arrays gets incremented as usual for every step of the iteration but the index for the output arrays gets incremented only after adding a new even element to the output

8920358
dictionary	map
therefore when we look at the rest of the code that makes up this function we know that the parameter map is equal to the rooms dictionary and start is the string princess_lives_here

8920400
pop-up	dialog
there s no indicator for when this alert dialog pop-up and if the user confirms so i can t reliably pop-up an unavailable message in these cases

8920412
button	checkbox
here i have two issues asp checkbox and asp button

8920412
button	checkbox
similarly my asp button and asp checkbox functions aren t localizing

8920412
button	checkbox
the entire page is localized except for this button and checkbox

8920417
google-chrome	safari
if you re using safari change the google-chrome in the first line to safari change the word title near the middle to name and change the word execute on the third-to-last line to do

8920457
google-chrome	firefox
but this happen only in google-chrome but not in firefox

8920481
youtube	vimeo
the problem i am finding is that i am embedding youtube vimeo clips iframes within the scoller which works fine except for the fact that the mousewheel scroll doesn t work when the mouse is over the iframe

8920498
filesystems	hfs+
by default hfs+ is case-insensitive so -e must be as well since it uses filesystems primitives to do the check

8920498
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
having -e be case-sensitive on a case-insensitive filesystem would be perverse and evil

8920500
width	height
the class for this div should have a background image your arrow plus height and width to cover the select size

8920500
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
height width padding color font margin and border is all optional for the select but you need to make the background of the select transparent and add -webkit-appearance none and -moz-appearance none to keep the default browser arrow from appearing

8920529
udp	rtp	udp	tcp
quicktime player does not support rtp avp tcp transport and it s rtp avp udp transport does not include nat hole punching

8920529
tunnel	wan
thus the only feasible transport is http tunnel in wan deployment

8920598
filesystems	hfs+
the lack of case sensitivity is due to the filesystems you are using hfs+ not the perl functions -e and open nor the underlying stat 2 and open 2 system calls

8920598
filesystems	hfs+
the hfs+ filesystems is not case sensitive by default

8920598
filesystems	hfs+
however you may elect to create a case-sensitive hfs+ volume when initializing a new filesystems using disk utility diskutil or newfs_hfs etc. just select the â œcase-sensitiveâ version

8920605
exif	jfif
most jpegs are jfif or exif format which do not use rgb

8921228
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
as a final suggestion instead of using an index ed for-loop to loops through your full arrays you can use java 5+ for-each enhanced loops syntax and simplify your indexing needs

8921251

you need to make a separate layout xml for the landscape orientation keeping all the elements same no of views and their ids as they were in the portrait layout xml

8922302
getter	setter
although you are probably right that getter usually just return the value the same logic applies to them as to the setter

8922309
getter	setter
and this class has its own setter and getter as well

8922309
inherited	properties
the output will be cinstance serialized according to the properties of c and what it inherited

8922309
getter	setter
however i like the properties are being serialized to be according to the setter getter in i1 only the cinstance properties represented in the i1 interface

8922339
websphere	ibm
we are working on an ibm websphere mq application and we use jms api to operate the message

submit	submission
to simulate the submission of a form you can send the same post request that your browser will send to the site once the submit button is clicked

8922409
keydown	keyup
its better to use keyup keydown event cause the change event only fires when the textare input was changed and the element lost its focus

8922410
post	get
first choosing between get and post a user can simulate any kind of request so post will not help you there

8922410

with the above code it is warpping text when the column width of column with index 1 is changed but not increasing the height of each row

8922520
keydown	keyup
when this happens in ff the only thing that shows up in the keydown keypress and keyup events is the alt option key leaving no indication of which letter key was pressed

8922520
google-chrome	safari
this is not a problem in google-chrome or safari as their key events expose more keycodes - enough that i know what keys were pressed

8922535
pull	push
i guess it s just a push vs pull question and which way git wants us to do that

8922536
disk	ram

8922828
getter	setter
some languages allow you to have a field scoped as public then if you need to add a getter setter later on you can do so without changing your object s interface i believe c# does this but correct me if i m wrong

although simple embedding of arabic words in english text or vice versa does not usually require this since the situation is handled by the inherent directionality of letters it is a useful precaution when digits punctuation marks or other directionally neutral characters may be involved

8923022
cassini	iis
to register the module with iis iis express see this web.config note the cassini config would be a little different

8923032

8923051
pseudo-class	visited
i would just use the visited css pseudo-class to style the element

8923149

basically you define the height and width of the element to the size of the quadrant you want to use and then move that quadrant to be visible using the css background-position property

8923334
des	rsa	des	aes	rsa	aes
a blog post shows that crypt on solaris 10 does not use anything like des rsa aes etc wich are typically involved when speaking of 128 bit encryption

8923357
google-chrome	safari
assuming the browsers you re targetting ff4+ ie9+ safari 4.1+ google-chrome 3+ can use the background-size css property then you can do this in css alone

8923386
width	height
by inspecting the imagebuffer object i find it has valid data such as the width and height matching that of the video file

8923391

8924329
ethernet	wireless
note that if the wireless network uses client isolation you may see much less clients than are in fact participating and also note that just like properly-switched ethernet you won t necessarily see distant clients located in another segment

8924339
folder	directory
so copy you web application in the sub directory folder

8924349
tabcontrol	tabitem
the result is that although i can see that customerviewmodels are added to the observable collection i still don t see tabitem added to the tabcontrol - the collection is not updating the the tabcontrol

8924376
multiplication	exponent
with quaternions it is just multiplication summing up the exponent of the sh base functions expressed as quaternions

8924376
cos	sin
expressing this with a matrix requires evaluation of sin and cos then building a rotation matrix

8924376
multiplying	multiplication
then multiplying a vector with a quaternion is still cheaper as going through a full vector-matrix multiplication it is also still cheaper if one adds a translation afterwards

8925543
google-chrome	safari
css 3 is not a option as 3d transform only supported in google-chrome and safari

8925617
inline	inlining
so templates give you more inlining because there are more copies of the sort code each of which can inline a different comparator

8925617
memcpy	qsort
another example with sorting - qsort takes an integer parameter saying how big each element of the array is and when it moves elements it therefore must call memcpy or similar with the value of this variable

8925639
qpushbutton	qwidget
i think your best solution is to keep the constructor mirroring that of qpushbutton just passing a parent qwidget and set your custom data by calling a function afterwards

8925661
mbunit	nunit
i understand mbunit can handle this which is part of gallio i had also looked into punit which is an extension of nunit but it still has a long way to come

8925661
testcase	fixture
does anyone here know a way where i can load in a collection of xml serialised objects generate new testfixture objects which can have the attribute added to the top of the test fixture and have them all run at the same time after loading in 1 - 10 .xml files from a for example c testcase directory

8925661

cvs	svn	collabnet	svn	collabnet	cvs
we just migrated our cvs repo to collabnet svn and now all files it seems have n instead of r n

8925776
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs

error failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins maven-release-plugin 2.1 prepare default-cli on project forest-parent the version could not be updated some.version - help 1

8926697
put	get
it s because your route is defining a put request but the link_to is making a get request

8926697
put	get
you can either change the route to use get or change link_to to button_to and specify the put method

8926701
int	double
profiling shows that the reason for this is the division needed to convert the random int value into a double of range -1.0 to 1.0

8926776
fadein	hide
it should fadein all list items and then hide any list items that aren t matched

8926803
ant	maven
it is desirable to keep console build system intact for the offline mode but i guess that maven is overly dependent on the network so i have to ditch it in favor of good old ant

8926821
inherited	subclassing
the reason i m asking this is because when i inherited from an abstract-class i cannot access a private field from the subclassing the only way s around this as far as i can tell is to either make the field public or create get set methods to access the field.

8926834
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
declare a variable or constant with the inverse value and multiplying by it effectively changing the division to a multiplication

8926859
getter	setter	public	protected
best practice is to use getter and setter possibly protected or public

8926859
getter	setter
if using getter and setter seems like over kill because all your implementations will be developed with the abstract class itself in the same package or module you can use protected fields

8926894
onclick	onchange
in handlers onclick onchange etc. you don t have to use the prefix

8926936
onchange	onblur
onmousedown to add that class onchange that other class and onblur last class

8926972
width	height
if after this you still don t see anything add a classname to your view and make sure you have the right css width height styles linked to that class

8926984
sorting	grouping
flexible sorting or grouping

8926986
client-side	server-side
i am generating xpaths server-side for use on the client-side and i was puzzled as why only table paths content in a td couldn t be found in the dom

8926986
google-chrome	firefox
turns out modern browsers at least google-chrome and firefox insert a tbody tag around table rows upon document loading

8926994
width	height
if your element is wider than it s tall you might want to monitor its width property instead of its height

8927020
hide	show
you could do this in php and css by setting up your script to respond to a url parameter that toggles an active inactive class on the menu fragments you want to hide or show

8927020
hide	show
then its a simple matter of writing the css rules to show hide based on the class

8927032
pop-up	dialog
my app comes in one non-english language only so itâ s weird to have that english dialog pop-up in my non-english app.

8927081
client-side	server-side
php is a server-side language what you re looking for is a client-side solution

8927105

if i change fprintf back to using stderr and not customerr things once again work properly data are fflush to standard output my customout immediately

8927122
width	height
adapt the value of width and height to fit 80x24 exactly and you have your own console window going

8927139
spaces	delimiter
clis in this case command line interpreters will use spaces as a delimiter

8927154
client-side	server-side
configure the client to use that client-side certificate to identify itself and only accept the one server-side certificate you installed on your server for that part of it

8927179
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it works perfect but not in google-chrome

8927183

i am trying to make a simple little caption box that fades in to 50 of the total width of the element when you mouseover the element and stays there until you mouseout of the element

8927183
mouseover	mouseout
it also seems to randomly flash a couple times if i mouseout and mouseover quickly

8927190
googletest	gmock
i recommend you googletest and gmock

8927205
dynamic-languages	compiled-language
since ruby is a dynamic-languages it s sense of dependencies is rather different from a more traditional statically compiled-language like c++ or java but even in java you can load arbitrary code at runtime it s much more difficult but still possible

8927211
trie	tree
construct a trie prefix tree from your dictionary

8927219
webkit	gecko
so before going deeper and deeper into webkit gecko source code does somebody know how do they do

8927228
onclick	onchange
your best bet is to add an onclick or onchange handler on the calling jsf component which returns false if the desired condition is met to abort the ajax request

8927274
inherited	properties
i have been looking at in reflector which inherited from listcontrol which declares the items properties as follows

8927304
hash	salt
if it s an app deployed on the client java then it may be sufficient to use a static nonce compiled into the app and send a salt hash of the request parameters with every request to verify the origin of the request

8927313
ant	maven
the build di tools are similar for both - ant maven gradle etc are all supported

8927313
liferay	alfresco
some providers liferay alfresco websphere support hot-deploying of portlets without the need to restart the server which is not possible in case of servlets without modularizing the application using special libraries such as osgi

8927325
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested your site with both firefox and google-chrome and the send button is working normally whether or not i m logged in

8927364
mouseout	mouseleave
you should use the mouseleave function instead of mouseout

8927369
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
currently it s case-sensitive but you could easily create a case-insensitive version

8927406
superclass	subclassing	implements	extends
your superclass implements a superinterface which also implements by your subclassing thanks to the the subclassing extends superclass

8927406
implements	extends
implicit implements due to the extends of superclass

8927407
superclass	subclassing
subclassing here implements both superinterface and subinterface as well as interface defined by superclass public methods

8927443
distance	altitude
this data usually consists of latitude and longitude coordinates though they can also include altitude bearing distance accuracy data and place names

8927478
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox but in google-chrome the paragraph widths remain constant they don t become narrower as the div s padding pushes in on them so pushing the layout to the right

8927478
google-chrome	firefox
you can try it in google-chrome and firefox to see the difference

8927507
profiler	yourkit
the general solution is to use a profiler yourkit with a realistic workload which reproduces the problem

8927517
folder	dir
when that didn t work i had him send me a .zip of his xcode project to try building that but the prime31 unity plugins don t like that they point to his source folder which is in a different user dir on his machine

8927573
public	protected
edit also you can make them protected to access them you can refer to george s comment on my answer for an explanation why you should use protected instead of public

8927577
post	get
the httpmessageconverters are properly configured as other get post requests with bar works

8927582
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
its working fine in google-chrome firefox and safari but fails in ie 9 with error message access denied

8927583
createelement	domdocument
i suggest using domdocument and the domdocument createelement method

8927587
inherited	properties
define your attribute class to itself have an attributeusageattribute attribute where the inherited properties is true

8927598
preventdefault	onmouseup
since the onmouseup handler doesn t seem to be able to cancel the click on a link with preventdefault or stopevent or anything we need to make the link cancel itself

8927633
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you want viewdidappear not viewwillappear

8927698
folder	directory
the key bit here is the file.applicationdirectory.resolvepath mydb.sqlite line in this instance air will look for a file called mydb.sqlite in the directory that the application is installed into - in your development environment this would be the same as the bin-debug folder or whatever folder you are compiling to

8927707
inherited	properties
a data diagram in the database sense will show data items columns fields in database tables but the idea of access properties public private etc. or the idea of inherited has no meaning and thus can t be shown

8927743
uiview	subviews
allocate init and autorelease a bunch more views uibutton and attach them to the uiview as subviews

8927746
content-disposition	content-type
you have to specify your data as an xstring and specify which content-type and content-disposition you want

8927746
content-disposition	content-type
be aware that browsers could have slightly different behavior based on the combination of content-type and content-disposition offering a save as... dialog instead of showing it inline

8927748
firefox	safari
ie6 7 an 8 are all still very popular as are many older versions of firefox and safari and other browsers none of which support the full html5 draft

8927751
google-chrome	firefox
almost all latest browsers support html5 ie10 google-chrome 16 firefox but old version of same browsers doesn t

8927787
vpn	lan
if it s reasonable don t expose your web server to anything outside of your lan -- require vpn access

8927800
inherited	properties
for example i need this properties similar to the textalign properties of a button but i don t want inherited it from a button class

8927800
inherited	properties
so can i inherited only textalign properties

8927813
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this will provide support for firefox 3.5+ google-chrome 3+ opera 10.5+ safari 4+ ie 9+

8927878
invalidoperationexception	objectdisposedexception
in most cases after the object is disposed its methods must be aware of it and throw the objectdisposedexception or maybe invalidoperationexception or at least inform the calling code for doing something wrong

8927900
google-chrome	firefox
such you can create plugins for firefox google-chrome and not only

8927910
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for this we are using the default .load function and this works perfectly in ie9 firefox safari google-chrome opera.

8927922
put	get
the first i think creates the get object request after initiating the array to put the object in arrayimages it gets the count from arraypointer

8927930
put	get
it would work fine if the user would choose a date but if they did not choose a date that i would get an error which is why i am trying to find a way to be able to put a null value

8927955
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller classes are examples of container view controllers provided by uikit

8928034
postgresql	mysql
i am using postgresql btw which can do more than mysql incase that changes things

8928049
accessor	properties
is this because properties were intended to just be accessor into the class from outside and you would store the variable in the class

8928080
nsoperation	nsrunloop
the nsoperation s are busy downloading data - and whilst they are busy there is code to wait for the downloads to complete in the form of nsrunloop s and thread sleeping

8928107
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested in latest google-chrome v16 and firefox v9

8928173
g++	gcc
i am using a wind river compiler 4 gcc c and g++ c++ and it compiles all my projects without any problems

8928173
g++	gcc
for the c-code gcc there are no problems and i can run the analysis but for the c++-code g++ i got a lot of errors

8928181
versioning	upgrade
also i don t know what setup script and with what versioning should i include to upgrade the existing review_detail table with this extra field

8928216
subtract	add
used in internet protocols makes it very easy to modify a packet without having to compute the checksum on the whole packet you can add and subtract only the changes against the existing checksum

8928255
int	boolean
i tend to use an int rather than a boolean as your field for storing the disposed status because then you can use the thread-safe interlocked class to test if dispose has already been called

8928255
atomic	interlocked
using interlocked ensures both the assignment and subsequent read are a single atomic operation

8928267
maven	pom.xml
if building with maven make sure your pom.xml contains

8928280
hash	md5
the second would be to serialize each object and hash the file or do some sort of md5 checksum on it

8928281
uiview	calayer
you will need to use the uiview that contains the calayer to handle the touch events there is no built in touch events for calayers

8928303
twig	smarty
the extensible nature of the way twig templates work as opposed to something like smarty means that you are likely to use includes less by design - but there can still be use cases where it will be the easiest way of avoiding duplication in your templates

8928333
integer	unsigned
note that the unsigned integer is different from the signed integer

8928369
put	get
according to situation i get the html of content from the database and put it to the page

8928373
serializable	deserialization
most serializable are designed to ensure that data retains its integrity during serializable and deserialization not to produce a consistent serializable format

8928376
int	boolean
those type of indexes are very good for boolean int columns

8928396
ready	each
your app must be ready to handle each scenario permissions granted and revoked properly

8928399
post	get
you are passing parameters using get method so it never finds your controller action if you specify it to be post

8928421
google-chrome	firefox
some versions of google-chrome and firefox also have this restriction

8928468
maven	pom.xml
then include in into pom.xml with the statement maven should have properties plugin enabled

8928484
wakelock	powermanager
look here for more information on powermanager and wakelock and here for more information on services

8928505
calloc	malloc
but instead of 100 i have just 50 allocated by malloc or calloc before that

8928552
inherited	subclassing
subclassing meaning all classes that inherited from your class

8928602
try-catch	exception-handling
enclose the code in a try-catch block and i get this exception-handling

8928613
mef	prism
check out mef and prism

8928613
mef	prism
prism is a pattern that leverages dependency injection and works great with mef to load libraries dynamically

8928615
width	height
on it i want to find the width and height of it even before i draw the text on the canvas

8928634
google-chrome	firefox
use the dom inspector in google-chrome or ie or firebug for firefox to make sure

8928637
try-catch	exception-handling
using it you can create try-catch block and try to access to unknown data x 79 in try-block and if memory is not allocated in it exception-handling was generated

8928660
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome but in opera i get the wrong selection

8928684
robocopy	xcopy
i have thought on programs like xcopy or robocopy

8928715
integer	unsigned	128bit	64bit
you can store an unsigned int 32 bit as a signed long 64bit and make sure the value is preserved for the full range but an unsigned long seems to require a 128bit signed integer to store which of course isn t supported by coredata

8928745
infobox	infowindow
i think you have to create a custom infobox overlay to change anything other than the content the google maps infowindow is if i m not mistaken just a scaled image

8928778
put	get
what i don t get it is if i put and infinite loop to my thread myform createnewprocessthread my application is not affected by this infinite loop at all since it is a seperate thread

8928886
awt	swing
id like my program awt or swing to add controls like text fields automatically

8928905
getter	setter
suppose i have a class with a private property and associated public getter and setter

8928905
getter	setter
i want to test with phpunit that the property gets the correct value after the setter has been used or that the getter returns the correct property

8928905
getter	setter
of course i can test the setter by using the getter to see that the object is storing the correct value and vice versa for testing the getter

8928905
getter	setter
i created a property getter and setter

8928905
getter	setter
but i made a typo in the property name so the getter and the setter don t actually manipulate the property they re meant to manipulate

8928936
folder	directory
basicly i need a tuned down directory listing system that scans for folder and creates links inside a php file with the folder name displaying the images inside

8928963
puts	gets
at schedule intervals a script gets all the new values in core operates on them and puts them into a third table core_details

8928977
free	malloc
of course you have to worry about malloc ing and free ing the value

8928987
google-chrome	firefox
note that the above code works perfectly in ie firefox and google-chrome

8928997
comparator	comparable
like the sort method i want to be able to take a comparator so i don t want to force e to be a subclass of comparable

8928997
comparator	comparable
so in the constructor that doesn t take a comparator i want to verify that e implements comparable

8929017
getter	setter
to explain some things about reader writer aka getter setter methods in ruby

8929028
innodb	myisam
i had a mix between innodb new tables created by south and myisam old tables from the import

8929028
innodb	myisam
developing on a windows machine all defaults in the mysql config had the default table type as innodb import was from a linux server where default was myisam

8929074
free	malloc
you could thus overload hook malloc and free with a function that simply calls the real malloc function and stores the information how much was allocated yourself somewhere by over-allocating and using the first word or whatever you like

8929147
pop-up	dialog
i would like to have mysql table data to be printed on jquery ui dialog pop-up when i click a message link in a frontpage

equals	compareto
but when i try the code i get different results...if i canâ t use neither equals and compareto what i should use to check if 2 dates are the same

8929248
width	height
this will force the anchor tag to take the full height and width of the .desgn_bx element so it will still be clickable

8929257
range	min	range	max	min	max
to get the changes between the first and the last changeset on the branch hg status will implicitly use min branch your-branch and max branch your-branch when you give it a range of revisions like this

8929272
children	parent
parent in tablea have children in tablea

8929288
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
right column fixed position works on opera firefox but not on google-chrome any solution

8929289
getter	setter
your class exposes a contract in this case - ability to alter and retrieve name via getter and setter

8929311
filtering	grouping
basically your controller action will get a command class as an argument that will list your filtering grouping sort and paging info

8929332
post	get
i know this is super late but an easy way of fixing jquery ui autocomplete for codeigniter is by modifying the autocomplete portion of the js file to set the ajax type to post instead of get

8929332
post	get
this should change your autocomplete to use post rather than get

8929351
width	height
try this it loads the bitmap then gets the height and width then you just have to draw it

8929392
hash	hmac
hmac sha1 is a keyed hash algorithm not encryption

8929419
oncreate	setcontentview
once you get it all set up initializing the layout is simply a matter of calling setcontentview in your oncreate method

8929424
dictionary	map
i d like to essentially map this dictionary to be something like this

8929424
dictionary	map
how can i map things with list and dictionary comprehensions to transform my source dictionary into my destination list of dictionary

8929453
ant	maven
i really recommend not doing this via ant but by using maven as suggested in the book although in this case the only thing missing is the struts.xml file

8929460
hash	hmac
an hmac is a construct above an hash algorithm that accept a key

8929492
des	aes
if you are looking for encryption algorithms go for aes advanced encryption standard des data encryption standard algorithms

8929561
getter	setter
just testing the get set combinations would be ok enough but usually not every setter should have a getter and just creating them for testing is not a nice thing ether

8929627
avr	microcontroller
our code is a mix of c c++ running on an an at32uc3a3256s 32-bit avr microcontroller

8929710
accessor	properties
i believe having an accessor or a properties would be replicating the getpixel setpixel in a normal bitmap object which is not efficient and setting the image field to public would break encapsulation

8929717
post	get
also with the ajax i am using post not get but for some reason it s putting the data into the address bar

8929728
width	height
xy position and width height should not overlap but it seems win7 can resolve some problems by itself

8929748
udp	tcp
you can write a server program that uses kinect to track movements and dispatches points via tcp or udp

8929759
width	height
i need to first resize an image proportionally the width is the important dimension and then crop afterwards to chop of any excess height and then store the new version in a directory

8929765

8929858
ant	maven
just as custom tasks can be developed for ant custom plugins can be written for maven

8929858
ant	maven
additionally you can always call ant tasks from maven if as you need

8929858
maven	m2e
especially recently maven integrates really well into eclipse using m2e formerly m2e

8929875
setinterval	settimeout
you may also want to notice that you don t need an anonymous function for settimeout or setinterval if all you want it to do is call a function you already have defined as in this example

8929876
setinterval	settimeout
you should use settimeout instead of setinterval

8929886
hide	show
you can show hide editor area using iworkbenchpage

8929899
filtering	grouping
i am working on some ssrs reports and am running into an issue where tablix column grouping drop from the table when the filtering returns no rows

8929904
hide	show
that show hide a windows based on the state of this property

8929907
jar	war
the maven approach is to create a maven project for the logic of your web application this will build into a jar and create a second maven project for the webapp portion of your web application this will build into a war

8929907
jar	war
the end result is that when you build test your logic jar which contains servlets etc you will deploy that to your local repository and then build your war which contains jsp pages web.xml configs etc

8929912
jquery	simplemodal
i am using jquery 1.7.1 jquery validations plugin 1.9.0 jquery simplemodal plugin 1.4.2 and jquery qtip2

8929937
put	get
second if you want to get out the values you just put in you could use the output clause but i m not sure that s what you mean it s not entirely clear what you want to do with the values then you will have access to the final values that were inserted while still in the trigger

8929938
post	get
just because you re supplying post not get in the form doesn t mean ajax will handle it this way

8929976
ubuntu	linux

wav	ogg
i am looking for a portable linux windows mac os x way to play either ogg or aac and wav files

xlib	xcb
i ve read some posts on wm development typically use xcb and xlib i think they are too low-level and i don t want to repeat others work

8930045
bash	zsh
the problem i get now is installing and using bash in terminal except of the installed zsh

8930058
put	get
the revision.description field on many of the rally object types was not originally intended for developers to get change information but rather for display purposes for our rally alm saas tool - that s why changes are put in a revision attribute called description which is just a text field

8930066
screens	tablet
on a tablet both the listview and the details activity could be visible at the same time to prevent the entire screens from being filled with the listview and then a second activity containing the details about that item

8930066
switching	screens
my thinking is that i would need to create a new layout manager that would be responsible for managing which views are available depending on the screens size but where i am stuck is trying to figure out at which proportions the views would switching from a single to a double view

8930071
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this was the final solution that worked in ie firefox google-chrome and safari

8930083
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that this works in ie but gives me the following error in firefox and google-chrome

8930133
fdt	haxelib
afterwards go in the prefs of fdt haxe sdk and add the path where the haxelib was installed usr lib haxe most likely

8930161
width	height
if you want it to be a fixed size at 100 simply add the width and height attributes to the img tag

8930179
width	height
this may sound stupid but how about using a larger image but with the same width and height of the current one

8930181
openni	kinect
im trying to access to pixel value of depth map using kinect openni and opencv

8930185
google-chrome	firefox
at least firefox at least 3+ and google-chrome all

8930238
google-chrome	firefox
there is no reason for this to be browser specific i suspect what is actually going on is that ie doesn t render the error message whereas google-chrome and firefox do

8930238
google-chrome	firefox
if you really are getting different content generated in different browsers then the problem is most likely that appointmentlocation in not being populated correctly in the javascript in firefox and google-chrome and as a result the sql query is returning no results

8930260
ember.js	sproutcore
what you are describing sounds a lot like bindings and computed properties from sproutcore or ember.js

8930308
implements	extends
i have a class that implements an interface and that interface extends another interface

8930309
jboss	glassfish
i am following the tutorial at this link but instead using jboss instead of glassfish

8930348
vsto	add-in
i have a powerpoint add-in in vsto that do some operations like importing a slide from a template

8930361
opera	safari
after doing more research i have found that safari and opera are only desktop browser that would render jquery mobile pages as mobile browser would

8930361
opera	safari
as mentioned above only safari and opera desktop browsers would render this properly so i guess if you are testing on local machine use those two browsers

8930403
width	height
by default span is inline so width and height are ignored

8930405
post	get
you just need to set the form action to get instead of post which is the default

8930435
int	chars
istream get extracts a chars from the stream and returns its value cast to an int but you re putting this into an array of std string

8930507
int	double
here i use xs int as number is kind of an xpath 1 legacy function and it returns an xs double while the count function returns an xs int

8930511
folder	directory
made sure the permissions are writable on media directory and tmp folder

8930523
distance	polygons	centroid	convex
on top of that kernel algorithms are built area length perimeter centroid convex hull intersection clipping within point in polygons distance envelope bounding box simplify transform and much more

8930524
distance	polygons
it contains geometry classes such as point linestring polygons and functions such as distance intersection union

8930535
post	get
this resulted in the routing system taking the post from the form being unable to find a suitable method it converted it to a get which then found my actionmethod

8930568
onresume	onpause
in your activity s onpause you should tell your rendering thread to wait outside the canvas lock unlock and then let it run again in onresume

8930568
onresume	onpause
a simple approach to doing this would be to create the rendering thread in onresume and then in onpause signal that it should exit maybe by setting a boolean value read in the thread loop and then also wait for it to exit via thread.join before returning from onpause

8930573
width	height
it s impossible to know how much memory is consumed by a given cuda array - obviously it has to be at least width height depth sizeof texel but it may take more because the driver has to do an allocation that conforms to the hardware s alignment requirements

8930575
jax-ws	jax-rs
i ve tried jax-ws jax-rs and axis2 but no luck

8930599
ant	maven
i have some sense on what needs to happen but could use some help so that i don t have to create all of this structure and the related ant maven targets goals from scratch

8930612
width	border-color
alright well i have searched and searched on google stackoverflow other sites for an issue regarding how webkit handles the combination of border-radius border width and color applied to a box with one side having both a thicker border and different border-color

8930612
google-chrome	safari
this only occurs in webkit both the latest releases of safari 5 and google-chrome 16 and i m assuming this goes to all versions of webkit that supports border radius

8930632
width	height
what that means is 0 width wrap content on height then a relative weight for the width

8930651
pop-up	dialog
so if i call the page 4 separate times on the forth dialog page call it will pop-up 4 alert screens

8930662
onresume	onpause
onpause and re- open it in onresume

8930662
onresume	onpause
are you certain your activity releases the camera in onpause and re-opens it in onresume

8930713
range	min	range	max	min	max
bump of the pad first if that doesn t work you should try setting min and max values slightly larger than your data range

8930713
min	max
this is why you get an error using min max as strings

8930713
min	max
using this min max

8930717
udp	tcp
is sending packets via an established tcp connection after all hand shaking has been done a method to be faster than udp

8930739
tar	gunzip
when i download a tar gzip d snapshot of the archer-tromer-python branch of gdb using this link and then gunzip and un-tar the file using 7-zip i get a file 140 mb file named archer-archer-tromey-python-b23c218

8930741
dictionary	map
i haven t had the time to look at the dictionary implementation in tamarin the vm for flash but it seems that the dictionary is beeing rehashed when a value is reaffected to the map by the line in the remove function

8930748
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout

8930768
width	height
in other words i can not specify the width and height of an asp.net control in a separate css file because asp.net will always give it its own style attribute at runtime

8930770
super	extends
i have done a few projects lately using a database object super class which i use for quick one off record query update and extends with appropriate classes such as a user class

8930779

soundpool is bad with wav files with mp3 i didn t have problems.

8930787
vsto	add-in
is it possible to access an object in a excel vsto document level solution from an excel vsto add-in

8930809
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and i get the success its ok alert but in google-chrome i get ok alert

8930821
udp	tcp
edit remember the speed of sending packets for both udp and tcp is almost same and depends on the network

8930828
text-align	height
setting line height and text-align seems to make it work however the 0.5em container is to small for the text

8930832
ember.js	backbone.js	ember.js	sproutcore

one for get and one for post

8930846
post	get
.net note that this post has some voodoo in the first comment if you happen to get the same error

8930862
gridview	rowdatabound
well to use the datatable for flagging you would have to add an extra column to store the flag so you could retrieve it in the rowdatabound event of the gridview to change the color

8930864
button	checkbox
you are trying to set toggle handler inside checkbox definition while it should be on button

8930892
express	node.js
node.js server app often using the express framework

8930966
typedef	struct
since you initialized node without typedef struct needs to written before usage of node every time

8930972
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie7 renders the ajax loaded content incorrectly

8931004
versioning	upgrade
maybe upgrade of firefox to the latest versioning will solve your problem

8931019
udp	tcp
you also don t have to handle network topology and connectivity issues as much than if you used udp multicast or tcp connections in reverse

8931019
activemq	rabbitmq
activemq and rabbitmq can be easily embedded within a server using spring in a matter of 20 minutes

8931023
saas	iaas
you can t unfortunately neither aws nor any other iaas paas saas vendor i m aware of does offer api access to their accounting data currently maybe due to the potential financial legal implications -

8931064
yacc	ocamllex
i m writing a compiler in ocaml using ocamllex yacc

8931076
getter	setter
well you could make your life easy and use php s magic overloading __call method to create generic getter and setter

8931076
getter	setter
the __call method above does a quick substr check to see if the method was a getter or setter using the first three letters of the method name

8931076
getter	setter
it expects that your array stores lower-case property names lcfirst and uses everything after the setter getter prefix as the expected property name

8931091
getter	setter
a database engine i have seen at clientâ s application used magic methods to simulate getter and setter

8931096
width	height
you could use a 2d regular grid of points p0 p1 p2 p3 ... p m n when m is width and n is height of this grid

8931096
width	height
depending on n m width height of your 2d space and the number of points you re gonna use this could be just fine

8931098
ant	emma
i have successfully managed to get ant to build using the emma param and thus instrument my application

8931128
try-catch	exception-handling
either wrap it in a try-catch to at least grab some of the exception-handling

8931133
google-chrome	firefox
i have these routines which work fine in firefox and google-chrome but do not run at all in ie9

8931137
folder	directory
instead of creating a file in your application directory you should try creating files in temp folder

8931143
ubuntu	linux
environment birt 3.7.1 deployed in glassfish 3.1 ubuntu linux jdk 1.6

8931151
swt	windowbuilder
i wanted to install windowbuilder for building gui java apps and so far i tried following repositories to install windowbuilder or swt plugin but none of them completes the plugin installation and it stucks and fails in between

8931182

in that listener i would like to remove some other related entities but this does not seem to be flushed by the entitymanager

hdpi mdpi ldpi folder you have this xml

8931345
submit	submission
you ll without a redirect also run in double submit problem whenever the enduser presses f5 after submission the form

8931353
tstringgrid	tdbgrid
i ve seen a lot of code to databind tstringgrid simply just to avoid tdbgrid because of purism when tdbgrid would do nicely - just a overly absurd loss of time

8931370
lisp	smalltalk
note smalltalk and ruby can also go very far along this path because they are semi-functional they have outstanding support for closures in particular because the syntax for block closures is so lightweight and readable but i think you would find a language such as haskell or lisp a better match for the type of algorithms you are developing

8931375
next	except
it compares every item except the last - it will be checked by the second last item and checks whether the next item is smaller

8931422
post	get
you can also return whatever you get back to javascript like this after you do the post

8931438
hide	show
and another note - if your data and as a consequence inner html changes frequently then it will be better to re-render it each time user request it but if it is almost static then hide show should be more effective

8931467
getter	setter
would the same principle apply even when using getter and setter

8931510
post	get
the given blog post example uses getbytesfromfile is so one could get the size there but this is not a solution

8931533
gridview	onclientclick
in the databound event of the gridview control i am attempting to update the onclientclick event of each cell in the row to window.open a new page using a field in the underlying datatable that is not displayed in the gridview

post	get
check out for an example of how to make the necessary get post requests via javascript in order to interact with the gdata docs api

8931616
unsigned	short
your test2 object is an array of unsigned char and through the cast you are accessing its elements as unsigned short objects

8931616
unsigned	short
there is no guarantee that unsigned char alignment requirement is the same as unsigned short alignment requirement

8931654
client-side	server-side
calling server-side functions in a client-side file like that is not possible

8931654
client-side	server-side
nowjs does not allow you to mix client-side server-side javascript in one file because that just does not make sense and if it did it would be a high security risk

8931654
client-side	server-side
but it does allow you to define a function server-side which will check credentials which you can call client-side with no additional hassle

8931654
client-side	server-side
when that server-side function is done you can send a client-side function with the result correct wrong credentials

8931660
ubuntu	debian
since ubuntu 10.10 is newer than debian squeeze if you can do it on squeeze you can certainly do it on ubuntu

8931717

i make a mistake of leaving the title of a rss feed empty when i publish it

8931717

so the feed title appear as title unknown in rss readers when people subscribe to it.now that the title has been added in is there a way to forces the feed title in the end user s rss feed reader ie

in this script when the show link is clicked and the preview image is show the link text should change to hide

8931800
disk	ram
using a ram disk is even better though often more of a challenge to get it to implement for you

8931814
folder	directory
keeping all the folder file information using .htaccess file in the root directory

8931826
put	get
to do this i need to move the device and allow the sensors to get their readings and then take those readings and put them through some analysis

8931828
ready	each
you can checkout the documentation given in ...after you downloaded and attached to your project open config file and read the comment lines given before each methods in it...it will direct you to correct way...there is no exact tutorial for it...if u got any specific issue then ask a question here..we are ready to answer.

8931843
admob	inmobi
if you had 20 admob 20 iad and 60 inmobi the percentages for old apps with only admob and iad will be out of 20 40 for admob and 20 40 for iad or 50 for each network

8931843
admob	inmobi
this means if you had 20 admob 20 iad and 60 inmobi and iad was your top backfill priority you would essentially get 80 iad and 20 admob for old apps with only admob and iad sdks included

8931845
width	height
i ve found after toying with it that whether or not the bug shows up and how severe it is is tied to a combination of the ratio of the box s overall width and height as well as the size of the border radius

8931845
width	height
not sure what a direct fix would be other than playing with varying width height ratios border-radii or border widths

8931863
for-loop	arrays
you should also avoid iterating through the arrays from scripting bridge with a for-loop

8931866
children	parent
you will end up with a tree of regions each bounded by the convex hull at its root such that all children are to be subtracted from the convex bound defined by their parent

8931873
put	get
i ve put the id of the photo through the graph api explorer but all you get is the comments likes and tags

8931877
post	put	post	get	put	get
also so little effort is put into the php sdk because its really quite simple its all standard http stuff like making a get request and getting back a json xml response reading the signed_request from the post parameters and decoding it

8931877
pop-up	dialog
the same cannot be said for the javascript sdk which has to deal with cross-browser issues has to communicate with fb to do things like scroll your canvas page or pop-up an iframe dialog

8931888
width	height
i have a uiwebview which has images in it say that i have the point coordinates of the x y position of the image width and height

8931932
getter	setter
you will need to implement the getter and setter explicitly it cannot be an automatic property

post	get
the api statements are sent to the google fusion tables server using http get requests for queries and post requests for inserts updates and deletes from a web client application

8934757
post	get
there you have it like i suggested you have to use get to retrieve the data and use post only to send commands to edit the data

8934757
post	get
change the query function to use get and then write a separate edit function that uses post to edit the data

8934782

int	chars
however for many operations you cannot tell if the compiler actually did the operations in the precision of an int and then converted to a chars to store in your variable or if the operations were done in chars all along

8935697
int	chars
if you promoted to int you would get 600 which would then be implicitly down cast into an unsigned chars which would wrap modulo 256 thus giving a final result of 88

oncreate	setcontentview
all you need to do is create a xml file that has the layout with the webview widget in it and inflate it on your oncreate using setcontentview

8935725
jobs	cron
then you run only this one program in batch...it will run them in the correct order and automatically wait for them to finish executing before moving to the next program setting up separate cron jobs would require you to overestimate how long each one takes so they wouldn t conflict

8935726
min	max
nothing precludes adding a setprogress int progress in min int max method and the attendant property change support but it s hard to see any advantageâ the recipient would just have to scale it for display

8935729
hex	binary
i wonder how to secure it from for example someone obtaining the binary and searching for it in some hex viewer

packets	multicast
my question is if a listener receives a multicast packets can it send a unicast response to whichever process speaker sent it without opening a new unicast-style socket

8936004
packets	multicast
edit at the very least i can pull the ip address of the speaker s multicast packets and connect to some unicast-style port that process may be listening on right

8936058
google-chrome	firefox
i cannot get the xsl rendered version to display anything other than a blank white page in google-chrome firefox

8936072
mp3	ogg
i originally converted them from mp3 to ogg using ffmpeg in the command line

8936072
google-chrome	firefox
testing audio on its own in the browser showed issues with ogg on both google-chrome and firefox

8936073
children	parent
the treelist will still have to do a postback when you expand because the parent node s children get created on expand

8936073
treeview	treelist
but that s for treeview might work on treelist

8936077
freebsd	centos

width	height
css3 adds the box-sizing attribute which allows you to circumvent the default box model rendering and instead instruct it to include the padding within the element fully honouring the specified width and height

8936114
min	max	width	height
the specified width and height and respective min max properties on this element determine the border box of the element

8936114
width	height
that is any padding or border specified on the element is laid out and drawn inside this specified width and height

8936114
width	height
the content width and height are calculated by subtracting the border and padding widths of the respective sides from the specified â widthâ and â heightâ properties

8936114
width	height
as the content width and height cannot be negative css21 section 10.2 this computation is floored at 0

8936120
telerik	radwindow

datediff	difference
what you want to use is the datediff function and get the difference between today s day getdate and the stored dates time_of_post

8936201
subclass	accessor
that already highlights one way to delegate to the subclass define an accessor method a getter that subclass must override

8936268
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox both exhibit this behavior

8936287
persistent	transient
another way to do this is to have the value be persistent in one value but you use a transient property as the value that your code interacts with

8936343
min	max
for three numbers look for the min and max

8936343
min	max
then look for the number that is neither min nor max d

8936382

qapplication	qwidget
qwidget must construct a qapplication before a qpaintdevice

8936546
client-side	server-side
your server gets less traffic if changes are made client-side with javascript but if there are complicate operations it could be a drag on the client s cpu so it might not be worth any server-side gains

8936576
chm	rtf
create professional technical documentation in multiple and localizable formats - html chm microsoft help viewer vs 2013 2012 2010 help ms help 2 vs 2002 - 2008 help docx ooxml format used in ms word which can be easily exported to pdf rtf help manual xml and others

8936710
websphere	ibm
it s been quite an experience trying to get a small grails application to build using ibm s jdk and run on websphere 7

8936712
getter	setter
all you need to create property in your action class and provide there getter and setter once this is done framework will push them in to the valuestack with action processing

8936725
put	get
if i want now to access these wrapped lines i can get it through richedit.lines.text which will put automatically crlf at column 80

8936736
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	igmp	icmp	igmp	udp	igmp	tcp
they re a tool to let you manually assemble or inspect the contents of ip packets including the higher-level headers inside the ip packet that tell whether it s tcp udp icmp igmp etc

8936736
udp	tcp
for your application you almost certainly want tcp or udp sockets

8936778
textview	simpleadapter
i have a list view that is built using a simpleadapter each row is defined by a layout containing a tablerow and a few textview

8936781
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox but not in google-chrome

8936798
width	height
to fix this i save the original width and height in variables and set object.contentwidth and contentheigth equal to these variables whenever necessary

8936798
width	height
when i print the original width and height variables the content widths and height and the regular widths and height they re all the same value as if the object was never scaled

8936825
httpresponse	request
don t have to construct the httpresponse until i perform the request

8936831
integer	unsigned
the large number is actually -1 expressed as an unsigned integer

8936884
folder	directory
anyway the obvious solution is to add another layer of namespace qualification by turning project directory into super packages add __init__.py files to each folder and remove these folder from the lines by which sys.path is extended

8936928
hash	md5
assuming that the output of md5 is a hash in column 4 and a file name in column 2 with the parentheses around the name not mattering and also assuming that the names do not contain any spaces because spaces in the file name will mess up the column numbering then you probably want something like

8936928
hash	md5
if there is no entry in the associative array file for the given md5 hash then an entry is created with the file s name

8936939
width	height
one way to fix this is to translate the canvas by its width height 2 then 0 0 is at the middle -- be aware of this

8936947
width	height
1 you defined textview as fill_parent width and height so no space for edittext

8936947
width	height
2 editext width height is zero

8936953
width	height
instead divide the screen width or height in half mirror across that

8937075
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in safari google-chrome ie9 but the animation is really choppy in firefox 7 8 9 on osx

8937201
put	get
you d need to determine where in the plist you were trying to get an array and why there was a string where you expected an arrayâ whether you created the plist incorrectly putting a string into it where you meant to put an array or are examining it incorrectly the presence of a string is correct

8937208
min	max
i do know how max and min heap work but i am not sure that whether heap is implicit data structure to implement priority queue

8937214
width	height
keep in mind that labels maybe really long texts so i have on labels width height auto

8937289
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
the problem is with google-chrome opera and safari

8937334
versioning	upgrade
if i upgrade from dnn versioning 4.4 to versioning 4.9.5 and then to versioning 6.1.2 then it gives me the error

8937379

warning note expected const chars but argument is of type int

8937380
textview	imageview
i want to give id to some views textview imageview etc in a layout that is programmetically created

8937389

i do not know what you represent by the key of the dictionary but you can create a new intermediate entity with keys of employee employeeleaveentitlement and dictionary key and map this as a collection in your employee class

8937393
ssl	https
here s how i plan on doing it - everything over https using ssl of course

8937394
ostream	ostringstream
i m already including iostream and ostream libraries so i m not sure why it s treating ostringstream as undefined.

8937416
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
can anyone explain how asp.net-mvc retrieve values from anonymous type parameters such as html.actionlink where the parameter representing html attributes can be passed in as anonymous type

8937427

8937611
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
after seeing questions related to this issue here and here i tried both wmode opaque and wmode transparent which solved the problem for google-chrome opera and safari

8937637
getter	setter
now my register and login bean contain getter and setter

8937704
int	chars
several instruction set architectures do not have any arithmetic machine instructions to operate on less-than-a-word int like short and chars

8937722
integer	fractions
fractions second is the part of the time that is not an integer

8937730
g++	gcc
the c++ compiler in the gcc gnu compiler collection is g++ not gcc

8937730
g++	gcc
you can use -wmissing-prototypes with c code and gcc to spot such problems but the option is not valid for g++

8937738
pascal	delphi
the delphi pascal version doesn t need to protect c from being included twice in a because it doesn t use the to achieve this goal it use the uses statement

8937767
disk	ram
however there are situations where the machine code is not yet in ram and the kernel has to load it from disk

8937782
accessor	properties
because all those properties are readonly only get accessor is provided

8937827
put	get
and then put it into postgres get two lines devided by empty n line and put it into db table

8937956
popupwindow	dialog
i met this issue also can only try a alternative way to display a transparent dialog activity instead of parent popupwindow

8937963
ciimage	uiimage
i know i can access the properties weather it i have my image as uiimage or ciimage but the properties that these seem to have differ from each other even if it is the same image

8937981
width	height
it will also help if you have the right width height ratio in this case 3 4

8937983
stdio	fflush
the stdio stream buffers are fflush

8938018
getter	setter
so the class is just dummy storage with getter and setter

8938024
getter	setter
i have declared this array and getter setter

8938053
button	checkbox
i didn t apply paging on my gridview and it extends to more than 600 records with checkbox button etc. and the value of 2001 didn t work

8938078
hide	show
the goal to solve the problem is show or hide dialog between activity s on resume and onpause

8938097
inherited	properties
i ve wrapped these methods up into a library - the library implements these methods as a category on nsobject so any class can be saved or loaded and it also adds support for coding inherited properties which my original answer doesn t handle

8938097
inherited	properties
i ve updated the answer to correctly deal with inherited and read-only properties

8938161
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
one can implement it by passing the value to next class under navigationcontroller using pushviewcontroller

8938171
teamcity	ncover
see also teamcity documentation - you can try running with a different runner or collecting coverage with ncover or disable coverage altogether

8938226
onresume	onpause
and in onresume and onpause i m doing this

8938250
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari and opera do not allow it in the first place while ie is just fooling you that it can but won t actually submit the file selected this way

8938256
stdout	stderr
read the stdout stderr file contents created by start-process

8938262
stdout	stderr
- parse stdout stderr to find out predefined patterns

8938270
min	max
for simplicity you may at least use max and min functions for querying timestamp field instead of top 1 and order by

8938293
onresume	onpause
registering it in onresume and unregistering in onpause is safe and enough in your case

8938297
quicksort	mergesort
of course you should not use it in production as there are better performing algorithms for large lists such as quicksort or mergesort which are implemented by arrays.sort array

8938301
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested it in google-chrome and safari the graphs are drawn locally in the browser using javascript

8938304
folder	directory
in your app directory create a folder called lib

8938342
int	chars
yes int promotions are done on all small int types chars short and c99 bool

8938350
apache	nginx
both nginx and apache can be configured to pass requests on to other servers depending on various conditions like path pattern matching and being otherwise unable to serve the request

8938430
quicksort	heapsort
once you have a better grasp of heapsort you may want to look into the introsort algorithm which combines quicksort heapsort and insertion sort to produce an extremely fast sorting algorithm that combines the strength of quicksort fast sorting on average heapsort excellent worst-case behavior and insertion sort fast sorting for small arrays

8938489
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to put bar to close to black footer its working in google-chrome but not in firefox and opera

8938489
opera	firefox
but in firefox and opera the social bar is down and not coming directly underneath the footer

8938495
client-side	server-side
in a more complex case several pages flexible width use a preprocessor or server-side code or client-side code that adds soft hyphens

8938495
client-side	server-side
the client-side approach is simplest and can be applied independently of server-side technologies and authoring tools

8938509
gobject	dbus
iâ m very new to gobject dbus programming

8938581
google-chrome	safari
the ondragover event needs to be canceled in google-chrome and safari to allow firing the ondrop event

8938609
strftime	strtotime
strftime 10-10-2012 strtotime dt

8938615
hex	binary	addition	multiplication
ok i know hex decimal binary their addition multiplication their conversion

8938631
shapefile	geojson
it uses ogr library mentioned here and alows to convert most used gis formats to any other gis format - so for you for example from esri shapefile to geojson gml csv or other text-based formats

8938650
oncreate	ondestroy
i think if you use oncreate for register and ondestroy to unregister that ill solve your problem

8938695
udp	tcp
it can connect to any standard tcp or udp server

8938732
width	height
aspect ratio is the width height ratio of images and if you resize images maintaining the ratio then their clarity is maintained

8938732
width	height
now tag resizes by aspect ratio if you give only one of the attributes of width or height

8938744
hex	binary
hex is just a means of representing the binary data in a more easily understood form than binary

8938745
padding	overlapping
the css style of the logo must be overlapping with another one which is also assigning padding margin

8938806
button	checkbox
the problem is that the program controls the values of the checkbox before i press the run button

8938807
strftime	strtotime
just change the format by editing below line of script strftime 10-10-2012 strtotime dt

8938829
hex	binary
if you need to find a hex string in binary file may be better to use something like this tell me if there some bugs problems

8938829
fseek	fread
but if you are parsing game s settings file i d advise you to use fseek fread and unpack to seek to a place of where setting is read portion of bytes and unpack it to php s variable types

8938864
min	max
there is nothing big logic in this if you know the num value take two variable min and max

8938945
g++	gcc
use g++ instead of gcc

8938951
ocp	principles
i think this approach breaks the ocp principles and probably other principles

8938990
g++	gcc
generally cmath is in c++ g++ s include path not gcc

8939008
maven	pom.xml
i want to enable findbugs report in a maven 3 project site and did it by adding this to my pom.xml as described here

8939057
folder	directory
now my applet on website only copies xuggle folder and my main program jar into a temp directory from a zip file

8939080
width	height
when i change its height and width from wrap_content to 1000px and 500px it looks ok in xml but when i launch it in the emulator it gets very blurry as if it would be at first scaled down and then expanded again

8939100
jar	war
for some reason i can t jar -t the war file to view if it has the jquery javascript library but on the server i can see it s in the exploded view in tomcat

8939125
hive	hdfs
you can try create-hive-table tool to populate a hive metastore with the table definition based on the table present in hdfs

8939154
hide	show
clicking anywhere in the article hide the excerpt and show the full story with photo

8939199
folder	directory
this will store all the meta data in one directory in the project root so there will be no files in your project tests folder for phpunit to scan and get rid of the issue

8939209
mouse	keyboard
that being said it is good to use events like change or onchange inline with the element for a drop down list because it is will work no matter what changes it keyboard mouse event or touch event

8939214
uilabel	uitextview
you can use uitextview with phone numbers and links detection yes scrolling disabled yes user interaction enabled yes instead of uilabel

8939249
kerberos	ntlm
could this be because i m using ntlm and not kerberos

8939262
screens	mdpi	screens	tablet	screens	hdpi	tablet	mdpi	tablet	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
maybe your problems is that the most tablet have xlarge screens and mdpi screens density and you put the drawables in the hdpi folder

8939275
gson	jackson
use a library like jackson or gson to deserialize the json to instances of your classes

8939296
flip	slide
quote exclude poorly performing platforms like android 2.x from the more complex slide pop and and flip transitions so these will fall back to the default fade for all transitions to ensure a smooth experience

8939307
serializable	deserialization
it s certainly not easier to write â you ve got to do all the path extraction yourself and all the method handling and all the content type negotiation in both directions and all the cookie handling and the object deserialization serializable thunks and â well lots of low-level stuff that would all need testing and debugging â or easier to maintain either since the jax-rs interface lets you operate at the level of resources the natural characterization of restful webapps instead of requests

8939315
qgraphicsview	qgraphicspixmapitem
i m having trouble with zooming tiff images loaded into a qgraphicsview with qgraphicspixmapitem

8939315
width	height
i figured that as the width height ratio is the same in both images i could take the percentages of the scrollbars before the image swap and apply the same percentages after the swap and things should work out fine

8939359
width	height
give the image tag explicit height and width

8939386
mp3	wmv
be aware that the data is probably not just plain mp3 or wmv but there is usually some kind of framing that inserts title information and divides the sound data into chunks

8939407
width	margin
i also want to try and avoid using any floating techniques if at all possible - basically because i think using a float would required me to specify a fixed width to ensure a relatively small margin between labels and values

8939417
filesystems	fat
the format is pure binary and uses something called structured file format which is not unlike a fat filesystems in a file

8939432
spaces	delimiter
while outside tasks like ffmpeg require the paths containing spaces to be put in qoutes path because windows console sees a spaces as a delimiter between parameters the method file.exists used in c# doesn t accept quotes in paths and works good with spaces in paths

8939446
versioning	upgrade
edit if you just want to test the upgrade process you can just install the new versioning on top of the old one - there s no need to delete the one already on the phone

8939461
trie	tree
are there any tradeoffs of using a trie instead of a self-balancing tree

8939490
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to create a boolian dialog pop-up message when index is being loaded on a mobile device

8939504
put	get
i looked up their online service and apparently you have to put in a special cname dns entry to get pagespeed to work - but no such cname exists on this domain

8939525
client-side	server-side
what i want to do is to present to the user all the data he entered so i think this is client-side not server-side

8939546
fast-forward	merge
i like to concept of git rebase so i would like to maximize its use and hence fast-forward merge

8939559
queue	fifo
on the odd occasions i ve needed a priority queue there has been only a small set of priorities so i ve been able to get away with an array of ordinary fifo queue indexed by priority

8939585
cvs	svn
since i set up a local cvs now i can go with any git svn

8939610
width	height
new bitmap width height pixelformat.format1bppindexed

8939613
google-chrome	safari
i want to highlight selected text in google-chrome safari

8939654
inject	interceptor
if spring is beiing used to inject the dependencies for struts2 which includes results actions etc.that means your code must be using struts2-spring plugin .struts2 by default use its own object factor to create instances of action classes results and interceptor etc

8939657
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
does a simple method exist to select part of a qgraphicsitem like for a selection with a dashed border for example despite its position in the qgraphicsscene

8939695
hide	show
just below your button controller put two view overlapping each other and once a tap s received show the one and hide the other.

8939696
versioning	upgrade
personally i bumped into many limitations in their premium versioning and needed to upgrade to the unlimited versioning such as complex business logic dynamic access control needed so you can redefine access control simple auditing and logging

8939699
portrait	landscape
if i run this app not in landscape but in portrait all works fine

8939738
ubuntu	linux
both hosts have a very similar configuration both are ubuntu linux distros dev 11.10 deploy 10.04 both use apache2 etc

what i would do is bind the canvas width and height to its parent container or set in code to get the actualwidth actualheight correctly propagated

8944912
width	height
the following code can force a height on a frameworkelement to set the width height as normal then force a layout measure arrange pass on the element in question

8944912
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
this causes the wpf layout engine to measure arrange the element and propagate the width height to actualwidth actualheight

i can see this in firefox and ie but google-chrome displays a that appears to be collapsed down to its borders

8945493
haskell	agda
a dependently-typed language like agda would have no trouble with it but you ll probably end up running into something haskell can t do quite quickly or weakening things to the point where the compile-time safety you wanted out of the effort is lost

dlsym	dlopen
if you plan to load a library manually dlopen and use dlsym to retrieve and resolve functions objects then using a extern c name becomes much easier

i put together a simple expression parser in fparsec at the end of this unrelated post

8945789

you can access various options including the one where you show hide bar items using designerview like this

udp	tcp
i wonder if it is possible on a linux system to optimize tcp so much that it becomes as fast as udp

8947790
udp	tcp
if it is i will just use super-optimized tcp and not worry about implementing reliable udp

8947799
postgresql	mysql
without having to do it manually which i m open to implementing if no other options exist is there a way in either postgresql or mysql to have an automatic counter field that decrements instead of increments

8947847
udp	tcp
in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp

8947847
udp	tcp
or are you talking about tcp fairness vs udp greediness

put	get
the go language datastore reference states that the actual types passed do not have to match between get and put calls or even across different app engine requests since entities are actually just a series of properties and can therefore be stored in an appropriate container type that can support them

requestfactory	gwt
the only version used to be in com.google.gwt.event but when requestfactory and autobeans were moved out of gwt itself and into com.google.web.bindery so they could work in non-gwt clients

8948116
children	parent
and finally to correct the float issue parent element collapses if all children are in float

8948159
mouseover	mouseout
it happens because when you mouseover on the menu item to click mouseout event is also fired on the menu div along with mouseover event on the menu item so the menu div hides

8948159
mouseleave	mouseenter
use mouseenter and mouseleave event combination it will solve this issue

google-chrome	firefox
preventdefault works best in firefox but the problem is that in google-chrome keypress does not fire for some reason not sure why preventdefault would stop that but it does

in google-chrome this works perfectly but in firefox it adds a character representing the backspace and then immediately removes it preventing another character from being removed

8948176

8948203

most of it is working except the problem is that i don t know how to hand that next survey page object from the post handler to the getnextpage get handler in the redirect

8948203
post	get
it goes from the post method to the get method but the surveypage modelattribute is a new object in the get method and not the one that was set at the end of the post method

8948569
post	put
in the post rather than adding the surveypage to the model which is lost because you are telling the client to redirect which creates a new request and therefore a new model you should add the surveypage as a query parameter in your redirect surveypage you ll have to look at how the surveypage is constructed from the query params in order to know what to put on the query string

8948882

unfortunately in this example normally xna doesn t new up its spritebatch until it has gotten to the initilize stage which i assume is because it needs the graphicsdevicemanager to get the window handle to create the graphicsdevice before it can be exposed for anything to use.

although i didn t find anything to prove this besides personal experience or alternatively if you don t want to go to a new line and be absolutely sure of flushing you can use fflush stdout right after line 2

8952116
stdout	fflush
inserting fflush stdout just after printf ... will make io system fflush the buffer which in case of logging to a file should give you the right order of events assuming you are logging malloc calls to the same file and this is where you observe out of order events

8956599
portrait	landscape
the question i have is with phones and tablets that change their orientation from portrait to landscape upon rotation of the device what does max-width then refer to

8956599
width	height
however when you rotate the device to landscape the height becomes the width for display purposes

8956664
width	height
the size width height would then be the absolute value of x1 - x2 and y1 - y2

8956664
width	height
then when you draw the line you would draw the line from 0 0 to width height

8956671
int	chars

of course you re still trying to add a number to a string or multiplying by a string.

8956948
inline	inlining
i don t know what happens down the llvm road but at the core-level map fromjust and takewhile are not yet inline so if you re desperate enough you can get maybe a few tenths of a percent by inlining them manually if they aren t inline later in the llvm backend

8957109
width	height
game.graphicsdevice.viewport has height and width variables you can query that will give you the resolution of your viewport

8957118
qobject	qwidget
if you have any other qobject that can have strict relation to that qwidget you may use and overload

8957214
for-loop	loops
there is another problem which will not make your program to fail but seems to expose some misunderstanding of how the for-loop works specifically you increment the x variable at each iteration but that s futile since the variable x is used only the for initialization the part is executed exactly once prior to perform loops

8957215
requestfactory	gwt
appengine rpc wizard relies on gwt requestfactory to do the marshaling unmarshaling

8957239

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in some cases stating the obvious can be useful though just as a reminder to the user of your class if you have a fairly large hierarchy of superclass and interfaces with several levels of inherited some of them in 3rd-party libraries it could be useful as a helper to declare a class as implementing a specific interface even though it implements it by definition because its superclass already implements it or implements one of the subclassing of that interface

8957534

8958170
inherited	properties
i ve read a bit about hierarchical modeling but all literature about it seems to assume that every child always wants to inherited all parent properties

8958211
children	parent
in turn children can protect their state from being overridden through a parent

8958228
hide	show
btw i think your hide and show calls aren t syntactically correct

8958239
hide	show
so assuming you want to hide then change the html then show you can do this

when the submission event happens or the onclick or the onmouseover or whatever for that form name or that form element as defined in the js file versus on the element itself then it is triggering some action

8959319
int	boolean
with that out of the way my question i learned from experience and browsing so that a java boolean is stored as a 32-bit int if you declare it as a standalone value but as an 8-bit byte if you declare it within an array

8959323
google-chrome	firefox
local installation for google-chrome and firefox

8959325
int	double
for int you should use int likewise for double float long etc

bold line in the above question you have to add all the other expenses together and subtract it from the sal right

8959580
interpolation	splines
splines can be cheaply computed and subdivided interpolation to achieve the desired precision but a curve of explicit points loses precision without having weight information

8959580
move	drag
splines are also really useful in vector art think flash or adobe illustrator and 3d graphics because you can intuitively drag a few control points around to get exactly the curve you want instead of having to move a ton of individual curve points

8959622
gif	png
but i still cannot embed any images onto the pdf be it jpeg gif or png

8959633
g++	gcc
also compile the file with g++ instead of gcc

8959635
free	malloc
appeals to the fact that it s c++ not c and therefore malloc and free shouldn t be used isn t -- as far as i can tell -- compelling as much as it is dogmatic

8959640
cout	cin
std cin and std cout are in

8959640
g++	gcc
please include that and compile your c++ code with g++ not gcc - otherwise you ll get all sorts of linking issues

8959653
free	malloc
if you do not want to get your memory initialized by implicit constructor calls and just need an assured memory allocation for placement new then it is perfectly fine to use malloc and free instead of and

8959653
memset	malloc
the compelling reasons of using new over malloc is that new provides implicit initialization through constructor calls saving you additional memset or related function calls post an malloc and that for new you do not need to check for null after every allocation just enclosing exception handlers will do the job saving you redundant error checking unlike malloc

8959658
post	get
after you fix the code i strongly suggest to post this code on codereview to get some good advices on how to refactor it

8959660
post	get
first of all you should pass in get post parameter which will carry the page to show

8959667

8959729
hide	show
you can make use of wpf canvas control and in that make use of z-index property to show hide your control

8959736
cout	cin
if you want to compile with gcc you should use printf instead of cout scanf instead of cin and fprintf instead of fout

8959739
hide	show
then use show hide to display one and hide another

8959739
hide	show
to show and hide controls use the visibility property of the control

8959760
cout	cin
cout cin etc

8959791
pop-up	dialog
search for pop-up dialog in the link below

8959820

super	abstract
in the latter case you can make use of an abstract super class category and then define two children one that contains operations for single categories and one that contains operations for multiple categories

8971949
folder	directory
a rather common pitfall is that you haven t inserted the source control directory that contains the module in the list of working folder of tab workspace in the build definition

8971983

i suspect the problem here is simply you are using udp like it is tcp

8972177

actionmethod	redirecttoaction
what you can do too is to submit the form and use redirecttoaction in your decorated actionmethod

8972332

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i add that using urlencode works an urencoded url works with both ie safari but does not with google-chrome firefox

8972412
getter	setter
it s a good practice to allways declare your class members private and to generate getter and setter on your class members

8972412
getter	setter
in your case you don t generate getter and setter there is no getid method on your newcategory class

8972412
getter	setter
the generated proxies will not generate magically getter and setter on every of your properties it would break the oop s encapsulation principle

8972430
getter	setter
check that appropriate getter and or setter methods exist

8972430
getter	setter
you need to supply a getter and setter for the property

8972439
put	get
broadcasts will be delivered to all clients connected to a network although most networks put some restrictions on broadcasts so the network doesnt get flooded

8972456
shadowing	named
which means never statically import methods with a named that is identical to a method in object because methods that are naturally in scope take precedence over static imports the jls describes method shadowing in detail but for this problem i think it s much simpler to just remember that

8972472
tolower	uppercase
totitlecase changes lower case words to lower case words but doesn t touch uppercase hence the need to tolower - then we remove the spaces with replace

8972490
for-loop	arrays
to invert the arrays you d want to use a regular for-loop

8972490
for-loop	arrays
note that the enhanced for-loop would let you make changes to the objects which any arrays elements referred to if they were classes - but that s not the same thing as changing the value of the element itself.

8972554
mouse	keyboard
this works if i select a new option from the open list with the mouse or if i drop down the select control and then select an option with the mouse or select with the keyboard and press enter

8972599
folder	directory
if you move the cake folder at all then you have up update web root index.php and tell it where to find the lib directory

8972902
post	get
you should post some code to get a better idea

8972973
lxml	elementtree
the only other alternative is lxml which has an interface of the elementtree type so it s higher level and more pythonic

8973004
kerberos	ntlm

8973175
google-chrome	firefox
everything looks good in google-chrome and firefox ie is just being a thorn in my side

8973204
width	height
your button will automatically stretch to fit the size of it s contents so get rid of it s height and width properties

8973204
width	height
then use a datatrigger in your contentcontrol s style to change the height width when the mouse is over it

8973204
width	height
be sure you set height width in your style instead of in your tag because if you set it in the tag it will take precedence over the triggered value so will never change

8973205
stdout	stderr
2 1 redirects stderr to stdout

8973205
stdout	stderr
| tee duplicates stderr from 2 1 to logfile and passes it through to stdout be mailed by cron to mailto

8973205
stdout	stderr
and the different buffering from stdout stderr might make text in file.log a bit messy i guess

8973211
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox this is fine but in google-chrome when you make the window wider the line becomes horizontal

8973223
post	get
it also depends on the type get post etc you set in the ajax options

8973331
postgresql	mysql
we never get this exception when running the same tests against postgresql or mysql

8973343
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the key point is that the segue between uinavigationcontroller and the first uiviewcontroller in your stack there is a relationship while the segue between all the rest of the uiviewcontroller is just a regular push segue

8973345
width	height
the width and height are set for comfort reasons but they are not necessary

8973363
width	height
textarea set the height and width too 100

8973365

of course you can replace qtreeview with qtableview here

8973407

8973570
explode	substr
explode splits the string up in several substr using any delimiter

8973588
post	get
i think the crucial thing is at what stage in your controller you attempt to get the post data

8973620

since using entitymanager in entities is a bad idea i thought this validation and user setting should take place in controller

8973636
bazaar	cvs
we are about to migrate from cvs to bazaar

8973636
bazaar	git
after comparing features of git hg and bazaar it seems to me their capabilities are similar

8973636
bazaar	git
bazaar 2.x benchmarks show that its storage size and speed are between git and hg

8973636
bazaar	git
on the other hand most of people are choosing git or hg according to ohloh only 0.5 of the open-source projects uses bazaar so i m a bit suspicious about bazaar

8973638
jar	manifest.mf
we use the manifest attribute of the java plugin to write manifest.mf files to our jar artifacts

8973638
jar	manifest.mf
i ve tried using a task of type jar so i can use its manifest property but the problem of course is that the manifest file is written into meta-inf manifest.mf which i don t want

8973675
namenode	hdfs
hadoop adds at least one machine of overhead the hdfs namenode

8973705

8974138
serializable	deserialization
i m not sure what you mean by subrecord but if you want serializable deserialization that can cope with upgrades to the record format to contain more information while still being able to process old now partial serialisations then the safecopy library does just that

8974153
profiler	visualvm	visualvm	jprofiler
in gwt development mode you can use a java profiler such as visualvm or jprofiler disclaimer jprofiler is developed by my company to analyze the heap

8974366
rss	feed
i m creating a small custom xsl file to render an rss feed

opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m happy of the results in firefox safari opera and google-chrome

8974629
profiling	instrumentation
but if you are doing this in a loop that consumes significant cpu time as determined by profiling with instrumentation you should consider using a c array instead which can be accessed using far less cpu cycles thus conserving the users battery life

8974631
put	get
you might improve performance if you put an index on timesheet_dt and make sure that it never contains a time part - then you can get rid of the trunc functions

8974648
ilist	icollection
ilist is not always bad as opposed to icollection as it should represent information that is already on memory thus providing indexing and the count property

8975047
maven	pom.xml
keep all the pom.xml and profiles.xml as-is and find a maven lifecycle point where we can generate web.war that has core.jar and web-commons.jar that has web_datasource and then generate admin.war that has core.jar and web-commons.jar that has admin_datasource not sure how but will have to investigate this further

8975051

maven	pom.xml
attempting to set a custom checkstyle configuration in the maven pom.xml according to the guidelines on the apache site isn t working in a very simple case

8975099
width	height
easier method - just change the style of that image to include with a properly set width and height

8975106
portrait	landscape
i did add an image gallery widget in landscape orientation but it doesn t appear on portrait orientation

8975133
screens	tablet	tablet	galaxy

8975154
postgresql	mysql
we are using jboss 7.1 mysql postgresql db jsf 2.0 with cdi beans

what you probably want to do here is not return a file object but rather a bufferedreader or filereader or maybe a fileinputstream

8975172
fileoutputstream	printwriter
instead of using an fileoutputstream i d use a printwriter

8975179
filewriter	printwriter
printwriter f0 new printwriter new filewriter index.txt

8975202
inherited	subclassing
i am asking this question because it is sometimes useful to have a subclassing inherited from one or more classes that provide some nice default behavior like inheriting from a dictionary in python so that works for objects of the new class

8975202
superclass	subclassing
ps i misinterpreted the liskov principle above sven s comment below points out the fact that objects of a subclassing should behave like objects of the superclass the subclassing itself does not have to behave like the superclass

8975206
qpainter	qwidget
derive your own widget from qwidget override paintevent and use qpainter to paint your images

8975229
min	max
now i know i could create arrays on the fly to suit and assign these but is there any way of populating a combo list by giving a min and max value and with out using multiply arrays

8975232
mouse	keyboard
just to clarify using click is a mouse event it does not captures changes using the keyboard

8975267
width	height
this would create a button at 100 100 with width 200 and height 100

8975322
many-to-many	one-to-many
finally if element is in one-to-many or many-to-many relationship with blprovider it is of collection type you will need some more complicated query

as the user types if the text is longer than the width i need the height to grow

8975330
iframe	prettyphoto
i m running a click trigger when the page loads to show an iframe of prettyphoto

8975337

if the subscriptionstatus interface is really really big and you know some clients only want to implements part of that you can provide a base empty superclass and you let clients extends it make it abstract to force them

8975340
put	get
if you want to put plain text that looks like xml into the cdata block you can pass new xelement ... .tostring to get the raw xml string

8975369

iprincipal	iidentity
the security is a custom implementation of iprincipal and iidentity with the roles for the user

8975517
google-chrome	firefox
but then while it works in firefox google-chrome in ie it would instead prompt to download a javascript file and that javascript file contains the output of the sau action instead..

8975703
maven	m2e
it turns out that the m2e plugin which manages maven projects in eclipse adds an exclusion filter of to any resource directory

8975703
folder	directory
this exclusion filter prevents the nls wizard from using that resource directory as its source folder

8975718
folder	directory

8978993
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade the package to the newest versioning run

8979015
xslt	xquery
unfortunately though although many xslt 2.0 and xquery 1.0 processors allow you to use a case-blind collation there are no standards for collation uris so your code becomes processor-dependent

8979049
put	get
does anybody know a company that gives this service i mean i put some apps to download and i get paid for each download

8979050
versioning	upgrade
oh and you probably want to upgrade to the latest versioning of javax.mail

8979120
maven	pom.xml
many maven plugins will by default use the project.build.sourceencoding property so setting this in your pom.xml will cover most plugins

8979128

i just added two series to the spider chart one series indicates the minimum and the other one the maximum of the desired range

8979317
post	get
all i need to do is post the data and get a simple 1 or 0 succeed or fail from a php script

8979329
kobold2d	cocos2d-iphone
if you want to use cocos2d-iphone with arc consider using kobold2d

8979329
kobold2d	cocos2d-iphone
since it s the default option you can be sure that the improved version of cocos2d-iphone in kobold2d is tested well with arc and contains a few additional arc fixes

8979333
width	height
stretching an element let its width unchanged while its height gets

8979345
width	height
for simpler cases especially if you want both preferred width and preferred height to be respected use gridlayout as everybody else has suggested

8979362
hide	show
and because i can only find apps with one html i m wondering if all the existing apps only show and hide parts of an html file to simulate the navigation

8979373
sorting	filtering
i can create a fetchedresultscontroller filtering out collected yes and sorting by department easily enough

8979378
post	get
in other words it s the query string if you have a get request and the post form variables if it s a post request

8979387
factors	matrix
an additional constraint is needed because the matrix t effectively has an arbitrary scaling factors it is mapping between homogeneous coordinates which all divide out an arbitrary scaling factors anyway so there is no inherent way to decide what this scaling factors is

8979444
opera	safari
according to this mdn page it doesn t look like createobjecturl is supported in opera or in some versions of safari

8979452
typedef	struct
typedef is not required when defining a struct in c++ just

8979457
post	get
absolutely you can get older post from graph api

8979481
post	get
i have no yet tried this with form post request but very similarly we return partial html to ajax get request to do page changes without loading the whole page

8979511
for-loop	loops
i know i need some sort of loops i m guessing a for-loop

8979520
width	height
i don t want that so i have a temporary solution to have media query assigning height to auto and width to 100 when browser screen max-width is 1024 so that no clipping occurs

8979529
pop-up	dialog
restructure your code to instantiate the dialog once on page load set autoopen to false so that it doesn t pop-up right away and wire up the button to simply open the dialog

8979585
uiview	subviews
what to do for redraw reload refresh all uielements uiview and subviews

8979585
uiview	subviews
i have in my detailview a lot of subviews uiview see above hierarchie

8979638
integer	fractions
a microseconds fractions part rather than an integer value

8979640
put	get
the validation looks sound but it seems like a blank submission could get through if they put one space for all of your required fields

8979685
hide	show
how do i hide the following error information and show custom message in wcf

8979694
free	malloc
on linux everyone uses the glibc-supplied malloc free and so it isn t such an issue

8979712
hex	binary
just open the binary with a hex editor like hex fiend and modify it directly not a big deal

8979721
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this does not happen on firefox opera safari or even internet explorer

8979742
google-chrome	firefox
for example bind to this event window.onhashchange -- it will only work on modern browsers ie8+ google-chrome 5+ firefox 3.6+ etc without some tweaking

8979751
post	put
this only happens with post put or delete requests that s probably why other request are successful

8979771
post	get
when you perform post request using curl you get that error as you re not passing valid authenticity token to the server

8979777
client-side	server-side
it currently uses pagedown client-side and markdownsharp server-side to handle the text in markdown text for persistence

8979798
google-chrome	firefox
in trying to get google fonts font_face working with ie7 8 9 google-chrome and firefox i ended up with a bit of a convoluted mess of files stored locally on a remote server as ttf eot and woff

8979802
children	parent
i have a parent entity which has an id and possibly other simple properties name description etc but will have a 2-d collection of children in the simple case strings

8979810
public	protected
so i made inheritance public changed the method to be protected and in parent further restricted access by putting the using declaration into private section

8979815
calloc	malloc
apologies i realized after i posted this your aversion to excessive malloc or calloc statements

8979815
calloc	malloc
note these functions also replace malloc with calloc just a preference

8979823
junit	mockito
i m learning unit testing with junit and mockito and i want to test my service class which is a part of my spring web app

8979834

this works in firefox google-chrome and ie

8979838
width	height
when the screen in wider than its height set the image in css to width 100

8979856
getter	setter
since the type of the return value in the getter and the value arg in the setter are declared upfront in the declaration of the property it is avoiding redundant information

8979856
getter	setter
in this case the complier is automatically generating the private member and the code for the getter and setter

8979900
ssl	https
i have an existing site that works fine over http and https ssl

8979900
ssl	https
the problems happens when accessing the site over https ssl

8979900
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and opera correctly displays the secure nature of the url and when clicking the lock icon it displays the ssl certificate information

8979900
firefox	safari
safari and firefox appear to be doing this incorrectly unless i am missing something

8979900
firefox	safari
does anyone know how to get safari and firefox to display the ssl certificate for pages served from the application cache

8979900
firefox	safari
is there something special that you need to do or is it a safari and firefox bug

8979912
dictionary	map
in theory this solution has runtime o k n where k is the depth of nesting of placeholders and n is the length of the string assuming dictionary hash lookups need constant time while chris solution is o k n m where m is the number of items in the property map

8979937
google-chrome	firefox
ie7 ie8 firefox google-chrome all work

8979940
getter	setter
to allow matlab-isms like plt.setp and to maintain compatibility with older versions of python matplotlib avoid properties and relies heavily on getter and setter

8980003
int	boolean
im my model is it best to use an int or a number of boolean to store each radiobuttons state

8980005
google-chrome	safari
the safari and google-chrome developer tools both show the dom as

8980023
knitr	latex
not sure about how knitr but for sweave and basic latex there is in fact a trick have the r code produce a pdf file and then use standard includegraphics to pull it in

8980033
yacc	bison
you should be thinking about the gof interpreter and parser generators like bison antrl lex yacc etc

8980051
post	get
i was thinking this over some and came to the conclusion that if i could capture the submit event post the form data and get feedback on if it was a success i could then trigger the parent page refresh

8980056
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux 11.10

8980063
free	malloc
in addition to having just one call to malloc free you also reduce memory fragmentation and increase memory localization

8980076
winpcap	libpcap
however there is no winpcap release that s based on libpcap 1.1.x or 1.2.x so there is no winpcap release that can read pcap-ng files

8980076
winpcap	libpcap
in addition the libpcap winpcap api currently doesn t return time stamps with nanosecond resolution so even if you did read a file with nanosecond-resolutions time stamp with libpcap you wouldn t see nanosecond-resolution time stamps

8980125
hide	show
but having it follow another element seems hard because the highlighted element could move or resize or show or hide and i m not sure how to have the highlight follow it

8980142
super	extends
i ve been trying to find some resources on extends mongomappers constructors using super or anything like that but i haven t found much

8980160
post	get
post your code for the view controller for your first view to get more help

8980163
width	height
this would be a mobile-friendly site so i change the wrapper width with media on various screen resolutions so i can t set the image height explicitly

8980202
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
to make life easier i m considering using a wrapper around cfnetwork called asihttprequest

8980244
folder	directory
i would like to get just the name of the parent folder of which a script is currently running in the directory

8980287
uiview	subviews
any subclass of uiview always retains its subviews

8980287
uiview	subviews
therefore it is safe to call release on a uiview after adding it as a subviews to another uiview

8980290
folder	directory
but make sure css and js folder are in root directory of your website

8980301
stdout	stderr
read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

8980307
put	get
in a scenario where the main thread gets to the notify part before the secondary thread had a chance to get to the wait part unlikely in your case but still possible - you can observe it if you put thread.sleep at the beginning of the secondary thread the secondary thread will never be waken up

8980351
versioning	upgrade
upgrade math complex to at least versioning 1.57

8980353
hash	md5
if you want just send password to server and make some kind of authorization you can use md5 or some other hash function to hide thode values

8980378
width	height
fitvids expects pure width and height not with px added

8980384
libstdc++	libc++
after surprisingly little hacking about i managed to get libc++ installed on my linux box as libstdc++ is missing things

8980415
width	height
anchor links are inline elements by default so applying a width and height won t work

8980440
sorting	filtering
so i m getting a bunch of volunteers records with some filtering and sorting which is fine

8980455
innodb	myisam
but it would be the best to measure your results because it may depend on your hardware coonfiguration indexes use explain to check if you have correct indexes your mysql settings like query cache size and engine you are using myisam innodb .

8980486
post	get
the save routine appears to die within zoho somewhere...my servlet that is supposed to get the files back from zoho never reports receiving any post at all

8980501
min	max
i have a table as outlined below and i m trying to get the max and min values for a specific id but only if the max entry date is greater than the min entry date

8980501
min	max
so what i m trying to do is grab the max price and min price when the max price entry_date is greater than the min price entry_date

8980501
min	max
dice would not show up because the max date time happens before the min

8980526
quicksort	mergesort	quicksort	heapsort	mergesort	heapsort
if you just want to put them into a straight c array you could sort them using heapsort quicksort or mergesort

8980550
integer	unsigned
if you only want a hash_combine that hashes 2 64 bit values into one and you don t need a new hash function for strings you could just lift a tiny bit of code from cityhash something like this assuming size_t is a 64 bit unsigned integer add your favorite bit of preprocessor or template trickery to validate that

8980564
translation	localization	mongoid	activemodel
the translation from errors into readable messages is handled by activemodel rather than mongoid and embedded models are considered to just be attributes in terms of attribute localization

8980599
google-chrome	firefox
if you use firebug for firefox or inspect element in google-chrome you can find out everything that is impacting th and turn them on and off

8980604
ubuntu	linux
as a newbie in linux driver development i ve successfully recompiled a new kernel 2.6.39.4 upon my previous ubuntu 11.04 2.6.38-8-generic and am going well so far

8980607
teamcity	jenkins
i have some experience with teamcity and hudson jenkins

8980628
many-to-many	one-to-many
now the thing is this should be a one-to-many relation and not a many-to-many

8980629
google-chrome	safari
it seems this issue is confined to web-kit browsers google-chrome and safari

8980631
post	get
also i would recommend sending the clientlogin request as a post request rather than the get request so that the username and password are not sent as part of the url

8980634
keydown	keyup
super click keyup keydown blur

8980634
keydown	keyup
to super dblclick keyup keydown blur

8980642
facebook	fbconnect
i have an ios app that is successfully posting to facebook via the fbconnect sdk

8980684
fiddler	charles
use a tool like fiddler or charles to see the headers

8980712
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works great in firefox google-chrome and safari but not in any version of ie

8980728
stdout	stderr
when you run your python program sys.stdin is the file object connected to standard input stdin sys.stdout is the file object for standard output stdout and sys.stderr is the file object for standard error stderr

8980767
put	get
we can use the api and get json out put

8980769
pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up as needed

8980769
qmainwindow	qdialog
however when i started to connect the qdialog to the qmainwindow the signal slot mechanism does not appear to work

8980824
put	get
you need to get from queue 1 and then do a put on queue 2

8980837
nsstring	nsobject
because nsstring implements the nsobject protocol method isequal to return yes for two strings of the same content this method will work correctly for you with two different string objects of the same value

8980854
min	max
since you wish to pick both the max and the min these two tables need to be joined together

8980854
min	max
this means 3 self-joins of product to itself where two product tables are used to calculate the max price date and the other two are used are used to calculate the min

8980854
min	max
in the query below all lines but the last will produce a table with the max price its date and the min price its date

8980854
min	max
the last enforces your price of max happens after price of min condition

8980854
min	max
the p p2 tables are used to calculate the max price and the p3 p4 to calculate the min price

8980854
min	max
it would still work if p3 was joined to p only but the extra condition prunes out rows we re not interested in there s no point looking for the min price on rows for which the price is greater than the max

8980858
google-chrome	firefox
compatibility with ie firefox and google-chrome would be awesome if possible. someone else will be taking care of streaming the video but i have to be able to receive and display it

8980858
udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtmp	rtsp	rtmp
that might be what i have to fall back on if i can t accomplish this using udp but if that is the case i still am unsure of how to go about this using rtsp rtmp rtp or what the differences between all those acronyms are if any

8980875
post	put
normally if i had a variable that i wanted to put into the post request i would append a to the form however if i try this by serializing the object as json the json query is littered with inverted commas which corrupt the html of the form

8981017
phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
apache 2.2.21 php 5.3.8 mysql 5.5.16 xdebug 2.1.2 xdc 1.5 phpmyadmin 3.4.5 sqlbuddy 1.3.3 webgrind 1.0

8981045
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
calloc and malloc for that matter is free to allocate as much space as it needs to satisfy the request

8981066
getter	setter
fiction has its own field called typeofmovie and getter and setter method

8981066
getter	setter
what i m trying to do is i would like to call that getter or setter method

8981066
getter	setter
i cannot call getter or setter method from there

8981089
rss	feed
easiest way to accomplish this is to get the rss feed converted into a json object

8981089
rss	feed
1 convert the rss feed into a json feed using yahoo pipes can also combine rss feed

8981091
children	parent
i would like to be able to get the direct children of parent or the element i specify so that i would have child1 child2 and child3 nodes

8981108
width	height
if your device pixel is 1 unit in width and height then the length of the diagonal of the square device pixel is sqrt 1 2 + 1 2 sqrt 2 1.41ish

8981123
google-chrome	firefox
the animation works very nicely in ie9 firefox and google-chrome

8981169
avr	microcontroller
judging from the results of a google search it appears to be the name for the bit that controls timer counter output compare match a interrupt in the timer counter interrupt mask register of a 8 bit avr microcontroller its usage is as follows

8981189
getter	setter
i would like to know and i have done my share of googling is there a cleaner way other than creating getter setter functions and properties to give a alias to the element in this list

8981226
facebook	fbconnect
i have an ios app that is successfully posting to facebook via the fbconnect sdk

8981301
post	put	post	get	put	get
the important things is what html verb you are using get post delete put and your returned content type

8981337
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the same code though works perfectly in opera google-chrome and firefox

8981341
mouse	keyboard
i used it for a bar code scanning solution as there was no keyboard or mouse attached to the device

8981347
knitr	latex
knitr makes everything accessible for you so latex tricks are often unnecessary

8981347
knitr	latex
you may want to see how the default chunk hook for latex is defined in knitr to know better how the chunk hook works

8981374
width	height
these options should fill up the browser window according to the height and width

8981420
webkit	gecko
edit see my answer below for the vertical padding problems but i m still looking for a solution to the extra padding-left 1px equivalent on text-inputs only in webkit and gecko

8981428
inherited	subclassing
we have a content class that 4-5 other subclassing inherited from and anytime the master list is pulled up in the admin a query like this is generated

8981446
hide	show
after the user clicks something else these will hide some other links will show

8981464
versioning	upgrade
when upgrading from an old versioning make sure the proper upgrade procedure mysql_upgrade is used which will add the missing tables columns

8981469
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the problem occurs on google-chrome and safari but works as expected on firefox and seamonkey

8981473
put	get
i then put the code into my website widget and i get the same message mentioned above on my website where the facebook like box should be

8981478
width	height
there s nothing in the xml that will let you link the width and height properties

8981501
hash	hmac
b. you take these 3 or whatever you decided on and generate a 1 way hash using hmac for example

8981501
hash	hmac
b. take the other params timestamp and the encoded payload along with the private key you found in the previous step and use the same algorithm to generate a 1 way hash again hmac is what i ve seen used in the real world

8981502
webkit	gecko
you can t go under line-height normal in webkit and you can t have anything other than line-height normal on these elements in gecko so the best solution is to always style these elements with line-height normal to get the best consistency which isn t really a nice solution

8981542
setinterval	settimeout
i m learning about settimeout vs setinterval and i have got setinterval to work but not settimeout

8981558
setinterval	settimeout
remove the inside the settimeout or setinterval

8981571
hide	show
since delay works with the fx queue you have to pass in an integer of sorts for delay to work otherwise the hide and show methods will execute immediately

8981571
hide	show
i passed in 0 to each of the hide and show calls to fix the issue

8981582
stdout	stderr
the logs directory will probably just have the stderr and stdout files that you re already seeing but there s another logs directory under the tomcat directory grails cf-list-files tomcat logs

8981627
post	get
this means that the type post will have no meaning since dynamic script injection only works as a get would work and that all of the data will be encoded into the url of the request as opposed to being send over as a post body

8981633
dismo	maxent
the approach suggested by ben bolker is also used by the cran package dismo - to make the function maxent work you have to download the maxent java binary and place it into the appropriate subdirectory within the main package folder

8981637
submit	submission
html submission a form by pressing enter without a submit button

8981639
httprequest	httpresponse
alternatively you could have your signal inside httpresponse fire and in turn fire a signal in httprequest doing that you could connect all the slots to the signal in httprequest then once the httpresponse is created you connect to the response signal ondownloadprogress request.signalname

8981670
portrait	landscape
i have a navigation-based app where all views are portrait except one which is landscape

8981674
mp3	flv
for example in order to make edgecast happy according to the documentation you need to specify filename in the format of mp4 filename.mp4 flv filename without .flv extension and mp3 filename without .mp3 extension

8981674
mp3	flv
but for cloudfront it s a different story that mp4 filename.mp4 filename no flv prefix and no .flv extension and mp3 filename without .mp3 extension

8981674
mp3	flv
this format makes people even more frustrating when today i try to use edgecast s loadtoedge function the format the accept is filename.mp4 without mp4 prefix filename.flv without flv prefix and mp3 filename.mp3

8981677
factors	matrix
i d like to create a matrix that is binary for each row that includes all factors

8981683
calloc	malloc
well it depends on the underlying implementation of malloc calloc

8981683
free	malloc
the rest is made part of an internal free list maintained by malloc

8981683
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
my guess is that the x amount of memory was larger for whatever reason than you requested and hence malloc calloc was holding on to the rest in its free list

8981694
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
maybe something like a cryptographic hash not md5 of the password + a salt you would store the salt but not the hash in this case

8981717
hash	md5
instead of running cmp you could think about generating a hash for each file using md5 or sha1 or sha-256 or whatever takes your fancy using python modules or extensions if that s the correct term

8981747
comparator	comparable
if an object does not implement comparable you can write an implementation of comparator to achieve the same effect

8981747
comparator	comparable
if the an object is not comparable it can still be sorted by collections.sort collection comparator by providing a relevant comparator implementation

8981772
postgresql	mysql
i need it to work in at least mysql and postgresql

8981777
ant	emma
using the command prompt bypass jenkins ant clean ant emma debug install test

8981777
ant	emma
i am using android sdk r16 ndk 5c and the default settings from ant and emma

8981812
postgresql	mysql
the notation extract day from ... which i believe comes from the sql standard works in postgresql and in mysql

8981818
folder	directory
this will help find it in a temp directory or working folder

8981841
post	get
i want to get my form to actual post the input values

8981853
getter	setter
if your problem is just shorten the code to access ident you may just use property in the old style - that is you pass to it as parameters the getter and setter functions instead of using it as a decorator

8981876
quicksort	mergesort
you can use insertion sort selection sort mergesort and quicksort on linked lists

8981890
int	chars
when dealing with xml in which everything is ultimately outputted and stored as a string would storing an int as a hexadecimal base 16 string save more space than a decimal base 10 string because it uses less chars and i imagine the chars cost no matter which charset you might be using is roughly the same

8981895
cpython	ironpython
cpython is like c++ like ironpython is a dynamic language and has access to dynamic libraries which in turn translates to being forced to write everything

8981895
cpython	ironpython
ironpython is faster than c# in certain areas but not faster than cpython however you can link ironpython to any language thus over coming problems but then again you can do the same with cpython

8981898
flask	django
flask is a micro framework - something simple and to the point when you don t need all the batteries that come with a full stack framework like django

8981918
autocomplete	autosuggest
i m not 100 sure how jquery autosuggest works but from your code it looks like it allows the user to select up to 8 items from the autocomplete list i may be wrong

8981931
width	height
origin x 141 y 76 height 25 width 25

8981931
width	height
origin x 127 y 91 height 25 width 25

8981973
rss	feed
as an alternative you could use the answers rss feed and process them through yql

8981973
rss	feed
use the rss link along with the yql feed module

8981977

however i can not get a hold of them to help answer my question so i put it to you the following code leaves me with a sigsegv error in the notated place.

8982508
hide	show
if that doesn t work for you and you still want to show or hide one based on whether the other is visible use .toggle passing a boolean parameter indicating whether to show or hide the element

ioexception	fileoutputstream	ioexception	filewriter	fileoutputstream	filewriter
the docs of java 7 for filewriter and fileoutputstream shows that the constructor of filewriter throws ioexception while the constructor of fileoutputstream throws filenotfoundexception

8982656
fileoutputstream	filewriter
if this is the case then why a specialized exception for fileoutputstream and a general exception for filewriter is decided by java creators

8982672

8982717
apache	nginx
is there any way to make nginx or other proxy read its config from apache zookeeper

8982745
fileoutputstream	filewriter
if you look at the implementation of filewriter it uses fileoutputstream which throws filenotfoundexception

8982745
ioexception	filewriter
because the filewriter constructor can now throw either of these exceptions it is declared to throw ioexception which is a common superclass for both exceptions

8982758
disk	ram
if you have a 32-bit which means 4 bytes per pixel of image information image that s 800x600 it might be 100kb on disk but you decompress it and store it in memory to be able to display it that s 800 600 4 1 920 000 bytes 1.83 mb of ram

i realize that in some cases there might be needed to perform post or delete request rather then get

8983112
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the point is that in order to get the total risk you need to keep adding to a variable totalrisk every time through the for-loop so that it keeps increasing by the choice value for each value of i and i ve made loops start at 0 the first position in the arrays as peter s answer suggested

8983121
profiling	instrumentation
you can use your favourite profiling i think you ll need to use a tracing mode the mode that does an instrumentation and not a sampling mode

8983121
profiling	instrumentation
3.if you can t recompile your code but still would not like to use a profiling you can instrumentation your bytecode to achieve the same effect as in 2

8983376
inherited	properties
now window and scrollviewer both inherited the content properties from contentcontrol

8983428
width	height
i m figuring it must be due to what was pointed out in the comments on this answer that setting the width and height so sets them in pixels where as the xml layout sets them in dip

8983446
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the css code from your post is not working because it s a device-specific style and you are viewing it on a safari google-chrome or firefox using a laptop desktop

8983450
hide	show
take a look at jsfiddle live demo it should provide a fairly good example to start on in short what you need to do is when the user clicks on a element you want to hide all tabs and show only the one corresponding to your needs here s a snip of the code

8983450
hide	show
as you can see i ve defined an array which contain the ids of the tabs that i need to show hide

8983502
google-chrome	firefox
i found following javascript code to disable tab but it doesn t work in firefox working in google-chrome and ie

submit	submission
i m running with cakephp version 2.0.2 and was scratching my head as to why a form submission that submit data to an association of models was not revealing error messages for the associations

8983657
width	height
if you call the getthumbnailimage with one of the width or height arguments being -1 it will throw an outofmemoryexception as well

8983659
min	max
the only difference with the one described in wikipedia is that i advice you to build max heaps instead of min heaps in each nod change the property to the value of each node is not smaller than both it s children

8983673
mouseleave	mouseenter
you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave instead

8983678
width	height
chrome extension popups have a maximum height of 600px and maximum width of 800px

8983678
width	height
changing the width or height using css on the html or body element will just cause scroll bars as you have noticed when over these maximums

8983678
pop-up	dialog
one option might be to use a javascript dialog modal in the page when the browser page action is clicked instead of using the built in pop-up

8983708

8983709
getter	setter
i saw a code where getter and setter methods are declared private

8983709
getter	setter
that s exactly opposite of what we are trying to achieve through getter and setter

8983714
width	height
when i just use jquery to get the element s height and or width i will get a default value of 300 as it will not wait for the video to load

8983733
getter	setter
if a different programmer sees your code and wants access to a variable but there are no setter and getter he might think you just forgot about them and add them themselves

8983749

8983791
hide	show
the basic idea is simple every ajax call you just have to show the popup div and every you receive confirmation from icefaces js you just have to hide the popup

8983791
hide	show
then everytime ajax request on your popup is show and if ajax stop your popup is hide

8983822
cpu	processors
if these two output values share the same cpu cache-line this forces the cpu to flush the cache between the processors

8983832
int	double
the 1.4 version had only a constructor from double but the 1.5 version had both the int and the double constructors

8983832

8983856
ant	maven
integrates smoothly with maven or ant to run tests as part of continuous integration

8983883
getter	setter
that s exactly opposite of what we are trying to achieve through getter and setter

8983883
getter	setter
the reason for declaring getter and setter is to hide the fields

8983883
getter	setter
the reason for making the getter and setter private is to make the corresponding part of the object s abstract state private

8983883
getter	setter
that s largely independent of the decision to use getter and setter or not

8983883
getter	setter
while the case for using getter and setter is not as strong for private state there are still tangible benefits

8983883
getter	setter
the getter setter methods provide a place for adding extra behavior or error checking code

8983883
getter	setter
getter and setter can be overridden

8983885
width	height
i would just have an image tag inside a div and increase decrease width height portorational to the difference in drag but i don t know how to allow the div to be dragged

8984028
int	chars
if you think about the case in which a 1-byte unsigned int can have at most 3 chars in a string representation 0 .. 255 not including the null chars or negative numbers then sizeof int 3 is a reasonable estimate of the maximum string length for an int representation not including a null chars

8984031
integer	unsigned
you check if d is smaller then an unsigned integer

8984039

8984979
rss	feed
try rss or atom feed and any common rss reader mozilla thunderbird

8984990
getter	setter
it s the more object-oriented way to do it because when using a property you can change the getter setter later instead of having it synthesized if you wanted it to do something else

8985004
mdpi	hdpi
if you put the images in the ldpi mdpi hdpi or xhdpi folders android chooses the images according to the current device dpi

8985004

bazaar	git
so sometimes you will neeed to use unique revision identifier which is present in bazaar but that revision id is not default way to communicate with bazaar because it s long and cannot be easily shortened to 8 or so characters like in git hg

8985289
bazaar	cvs
with bazaar you won t have support for cvs modules as the core feature

8985289
bazaar	git
the main problem with bazaar you will have is almost everybody who uses git or hg will ask you every time why did you choose bazaar when all guys in their company use git or hg

8985289
bazaar	git
the truth is that git is clearly winner as of january 2012 among other dvcs git hg bazaar etc. if you will count how many projects hosted on github

ivar	subclassing
the solution was to subclassing the necessary uiviews and store their original frame in an ivar

8993366
cells	tablecell
thus to keep your custom cells subviews you need to not access any of the standard tablecell s properties

8993440

the hash method returns an unsigned integer try this instead

8993462
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it opens as an embed element and in firefox in an object

xpages applications are stored in nsf notes storage facility files which are collections of design elements that can be deployed as a whole and developed using ibm lotus domino designer

8993628
versioning	upgrade
we upgrade spring versioning from 3.0.5.release to 3.1.0.release

8993641
superclass	subclassing
only direct superclass constructors can be called from subclassing and only from the subclassing can you call the superclass constructor

8993642
hide	show
in internet explorer if the plugin fails to load the empty object will still hide the get adobe reader section so i had to set the z-index to show it .

8993646
ggplot2	lattice
when using ggplot2 or lattice non-interactively not from the command-line you need to explicitly print plots that you ve constructed

8993737
hide	show
i have the following code snippet and require to show only the first 2 and hide all the other

8993737
hide	show
i basically need to toggle the show and hide on a button click using jquery

left top width height are all required and in points

8993781
udp	tcp
i used to think my understanding of the tcp and udp protocols although limited is correct

8993781
udp	tcp
although recently when i realized that peers sharing a common torrent can connect to one another through a tcp or udp protocols without the actual need for port forwarding i got confused

8993793
hide	show
the toggle method hide elements that are currently visible and show elements that are currently hidden

8993837
x86	mips
some processors allow direct access to the tlb while knowing nothing about page tables e.g mips while others know about page tables and internally use tlbs that the programmer mostly doesn t see e.g x86

8993860
hide	show
so now you can loop through the array of these elements show the div that goes along with the selected radio and hide the ones that aren t

8993860
hide	show
otherwise if you added a new section you d have to edit each if statement you made adding the new section to make sure it show and hide properly

8993861
gridview	rowdatabound
that should be done in rowdatabound of the outer gridview

8993867
subtract	add
you could compose a datetime object or perhaps just change your procedure to accept a numeric days offset and add or subtract that from sysdate within the procedure itself

8993877
typedef	struct
to understand where is the problem in the second code i give bellow i have put my struct definitions and typedef outside of myclass

8993877
typedef	typename
i also removed the keyword typename from the typedef and i have put instead of nodedata in the first typedef even if i don t want to do that actually otherways it will give some errors at this line like expected a type got nodedata

8993877
typedef	struct
how can i do for the second code to not be obliged to specify nodedata for the first typedef because members var1 and var2 of struct nodedata are not necessarily of type int

8993880
stdout	stderr
b it reported the error to stderr or stdout which usually goes into a .out file instead of through log4j which does to the usual .log file and i forgot that the .out file even existed so i didn t check there.

8993901
maven	pom.xml
my aproach was to configure the maven jacoco plugin to get the argument and then hard-coded the property into pom.xml since the property generated by the plugin is not passed to the surefire plugin

8993920
g++	gcc
the w32headers project provides gcc - and g++ -compatible headers and archives for most standard windows dlls including ws2_32.dll

8993940
membase	couchbase
spymemcached only had a lot of dependencies because we added a bunch of stuff to support membase couchbase

8993940
membase	couchbase
for the 2.8 release of spymemcached though we ripped out all of the membase couchbase stuff out and put it into a new project called couchbase-client

8994045
google-chrome	firefox
hey guys this works for firefox and google-chrome in that it passes the data fine and shows the confirmationpage

8994051
post	get
in your case your using a get http method so you shouldn t need to post the json data you can simply include it in the url

8994057
put	get
i am trying to put multiple date pickers on a dialog box from the extension library i get this error.

8994069
int	double
why is it that c functions are usually void functions unless it returns just an int or double variables

8994139
put	get
so you re not duplicating the info about the test step fields a-c but you do get an opportunity to put each of those steps into many testplans and record their results

8994165
int	double
firstly your main problem the d specifier is only for int not float s or double s

8994281
rtos	mqx
supports multi-platforms such as wince and perhaps other rtos s like mqx

8994454
google-chrome	firefox
the previously mentioned method is supported in firefox 4+ and at least google-chrome 5+

8994454
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to also support firefox 2+ and google-chrome 1+ you can play with the __definesetter__ to prevent onkeydown from being defined

8994481
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know if this helps but the following works for me on ie8 - 9 google-chrome and firefox using a 1.5gb zip file

8994493
switching	screens
if you switching between workbooks and worksheets and use select and activate your code will be sloooow because the screens is being continually repainted

8994493
switching	screens
there will still be a flash when you switching workbooks but most of the screens activity will be avoided

8994541
inherited	properties
i d like to have it so that instead of re-instantiating __construct the same class each time to have it only initialize once and utilize the properties of the previously inherited classes

8994551
mouse	keyboard
is there any option for primefaces keyboard component to accept numbers form both keyboard and mouse

8994591
magento	joomla
i have run into a brick wall several times with cms s including joomla drupal business catalyst magento and a few others

8994593
stdout	stderr
i just ssh-ed to some remote server and found that stdout and stderr of all commands processes i am trying to run in bash is redirected to somewhere

8994593
stdout	stderr
1 which file stdout stderr is beeing rerouted in linux

8994593
stdout	stderr
2 and how reroute by default stdout and stderr back to dev tty

8994600
post	get
the first is to return the same json structure for a post request as you would a get request for the show action returning a single item. this uses a single request

8994601
umbraco	dotnetnuke
based on what you are looking for i d recommend you go with a platform like dotnetnuke or a million other ones line sitefinity or umbraco or orchard or something like that some of them like umbraco give you mvc too

8994601
umbraco	dotnetnuke
and right now i have a asp.net app that works great but i want to add in some social features so i m going plug in a umbraco or dotnetnuke site that integrates with it to host the more common social components

8994614
put	get
there s no error on the import statement and if i put that import statement in external.as i still get the error on the function signature line but not on the import line it has no problem with that

8994621
tax	shipping
one feature that s often overlooked are computed columns right in your database table - those are really good at summing up your order total plus tax and shipping into a grand total or they are great to put together your first and last name into a display name

8994685
disk	ram
each client s disk image could have a unique key it would use less ram and would probably take less time to implement

8994698
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to be able to do this with firefox and google-chrome

8994772
post	get
i ve read similar post on here but i can t get results with those answers

8994818
rss	feed
so i m putting together a quick and dirty app to add new posts automatically to tumblr based on new items pulled from an rss feed

8994846
tcplistener	tcpclient
a tcpclient object is assigned by blocking on a tcplistener with the accepttcpclient method

8994846
tcpclient	networkstream
once there s a tcpclient object i pass it to a thread that invokes the client s getstream method to create a networkstream

8994901
inherited	properties
because an a element is alway within body and td by default inherited the properties from tr

8994901
inherited	properties
perhaps you can selectively set white-space to pre or pre-wrap to some elements that enclose the relevant parts remembering that the properties inherited if not set on inner elements

8994921
folder	directory
while it redirects all visitors except 1.3.3.7 the images directory within the coming-soon folder is blocked

8994937
debian	linux
i am programming on crunchbang linux - unofficial debian based distro

8994964
fadein	hide
which brings up an interesting point trying to remove the fadein it doesn t even hide the element

8994999
floating-point	integer	floating-point	fixed-point
decimal itself is fine but most programming languages don t support fixed-point arithmetic only integer arithmetic and floating-point arithmetic which means that your application will most likely have to use integers rather than floating-point values since floating-point values cannot represent 12.34 exactly and the round-trip can cause wrong results so it s a bit of a pain to handle the conversions between application-integers and database- decimal s

8995072
post	get
if you add the time as the second portion of the key you can use a combination of endkey descending and limit to get the last n post based on the thread_id

8995118
post	get
a controller does not represent a web page but a collection of actions performed redirects get s post etc...

8995118
post	get
chances are you ll only have one controller but two methods for the get and post phase of searching

8995131
versioning	upgrade
with the latest upgrade pack 1 you can even install a supported versioning of the extension library which allows very rich applications to be deployed

8995172
pull	push
it used to be that i could run git pull and git push and it would know that i meant git push origin master but now it does not and i think it s tracking a different branch because git push origin master works fine everything up to date and git push tells me it can t fast-forward changes

8995177
gif	png
i ve found this capture html canvas as gif jpg png pdf

8995179
stdout	stderr
if you start your shell bash by following command all the stdout stderr will be rerouted copied to another shell dev tty2 in this case

8995225
post	get
that way your script can safely handle get and post requests

8995268
postgresql	mysql
the solution should work on a multidatabase environment mssql postgresql mysql

8995289
codeigniter	cakephp
if you want to head in this direction consider using an existing framework like cakephp or codeigniter to give you a headstart

8995294
hide	show
in my experience using jquery doing a basic show hide of an element does work but dom manipulation does not and getting positions of elements is sketchy at best

8995306
fadein	hide
however the fadein method works just using hide first

8995306
fadein	hide
.css opacity 0 will not hide the element in ie8 so my only option at this point is to use fadein for what i m trying to accomplish

8995324
coalesce	isnull
the solution in this link should be adaptable to those environments as it s standard sql you can use isnull if coalesce is not available

8995328
for-loop	arrays
if you aren t doing this for school or anything that you are limited in how you accomplish you could try something where you push the items into an arrays and then iterate through to print out using a for-loop join statement or string builder

8995332
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout
the hide and fadein fadeout methods toggle the display css property

8995346
udp	tcp
this is called udp tcp hole punching

8995367
qtimer	qobject	qtimer	qthread	qthread	qobject
qobject starttimer qtimer can only be used with threads started with qthread

8995380
pop-up	dialog
when applicable a form button with an onclick event on it pop-up that throws a confirmation dialog and then submits the button

8995380
onclick	onmousedown
if i change onclick to onmousedown all clicks work but clicks on the confirmation dialog that comes up don t work

8995381
google-chrome	firefox
now if i run this within netbeans the xml file renders perfectly within google-chrome ie and firefox

8995385
cout	cin
for each of the cin and cout statements i am getting an error which says symbol cin cout could not be resolved. i am also getting an error which says symbol s not found for architecture x86_64.

8995394
toolbar	tabs
i am currently using extjs 4 and have a tab panel of about 4 tabs and i want to put the same container which contains two toolbar inside each tab

8995455
capistrano	bundler	capistrano	rvm	rvm	bundler
bundler by default doesn t install gems into the default rvm environment when deployed via capistrano it installs to the shared bundle directory instead to try and accommodate production installation environments that aren t using rvm

8995455
rvm	bundler
if you are using rvm in production and want to just have bundler install to your default ruby gemset which is terribly useful if you are going to be logging into the production running rake scripts console etc add the following options to your config deploy.rb

8995455
rvm	bundler
this will remove the --deployment and --quiet which you may or may not want to keep and --path flags which cause bundler to try and package everything up nicely so bundler will now install to the user s rvm environment

8995527
folder	directory
in that directory you should find a hidden folder .rvm which contains a folder scripts which contains an executable file called rvm

8995538
serializable	deserialization
note that i m using new streams serializable and deserialization to avoid end of stream errors

8995593
g++	gcc
i m well aware of the fact cuda needs older versions gcc g++ and i ve installed gcc g++ 4.5.1 and softlinked them as documented here

8995609
folder	directory
the problem i ve got is that on the server i have some javascript that used to work would create an activex object of scripting.filesystemobject and try to create a folder in a virtual directory that happened to be on a shared folder in a remote machine

8995610
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
uiwindow doesn t handle auto-rotation or autoresizing - only uiviewcontroller do that

8995610
uiview	uiwindow
see orientation in a uiview added to a uiwindow

8995665
width	height
within the checkerboard class you could have the view divided into an 8 x 8 grid programmatically using the width and height passed in

8995705
sorting	filtering
i m trying to create a page with sorting layout buttons and multiple filtering

8995741
tunnel	packets
packets from tunnel coming with a linux cooked capture encapsulation 16 bytes header

8995743
width	height
i found that it was possible to work around this issue by setting an explicit width and height on the webcontrol

8995743
width	height
it seems that a webcontrol doesn t like being inside a stackpanel unless it the webcontrol has both width and height set

8995776
lxml	beautifulsoup
there are lots of option available like lxml or beautifulsoup

8995776
firepath	firebug
for xpath use firefox s firebug extension or install firepath

8995812
children	parent
it moves from the targeted element to the parent and then selects all ul elements that are immediate children not just descendants of that parent element

8995815
children	parent
.find looks into that containing parent element and only selects direct children of ul using that css selector ul

8995867
getter	setter
however i always see variables made private and then a getter and setter function used to retrieve that value sometimes even a pointer to that variable

8995867
getter	setter
so don t getter functions and setter functions defy the point of it being private

8995906
for-loop	loops
javascript has no block level scope so variables defined in the for-loop are actually defined at the top of the function hoisted and survive the loops

8995921
versioning	upgrade
maybe you will want to add some checks to the next versioning of the library or to do something when someone read the value and if the variable will be public in the current versioning upgrade the library versioning will cost a lot of work

8995955
google-chrome	firefox
this works great for me in firefox google-chrome and ie it should lead you in the right direction

8995965
lxml	elementtree
i ve answered a couple of questions here on so related to lxml elementtree and i usually see people getting stuck trying to write these weird list comprehensions to deal with something xpath handles in one line much more clearly

8996005
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
each element in my masnory grid has fixed width 220px + 5 margin and random height depending on its content and i am using media queries in css file to change columns number on different screen resolution page width can be 230 460 690

8996011
free	malloc
for example malloc free are c routines

8996039
gif	png
bitmaps don t have alpha channels like png gif

8996040
solaris	aix
what applies on macos x with its mach kernel is different from linux which is different from solaris or aix

8996057
versioning	upgrade
i have not found out how to upgrade and replace a package whose newer versioning is not still in the distribution repository

8996104
int	boolean
it supports int float boolean string and unicode array and dict data types and arbitrary nesting yay recursion

8996139
public	protected
in a descendant class is there a way to call both the public parameterized constructor as well as the protected private constructor while still making a call to the base class constructor

8996209
rss	feed
i d like to know how to change the width of the border of this list an rss feed so that it s around half the content s width and centred without changing the width of the div or the rss feed

8996209
rss	feed
this is the rss feed s css

8996210
google-chrome	firefox
at least it s not in google-chrome 16 or firefox 7

8996267
rspec	capybara
when i run rspec is it possible to have capybara selenium report any javascript console.errors and other exceptions back to rspec

8996279
width	height
what is the best way to have two divs left and right of each other where one dictates the width and the other dictates the height

8996279
width	height
then if the css is changed for width or height both boxes will adjust accordingly

8996281
src	attr
input name item_pic_url .val #mygalthree img attr src

8996283
put	get
at the moment the result i get is the list of the sponsors ordered by the amount as it should be but the team name appearing alongside it is the same for all rows it s not the one of the highest bidder and the bid amount is not the one of the highest bidder but simply the first one to put one in

8996326
children	parent
i ve run into a bit of struggle with .find and .attr i think when trying to iterate through an xml and find and return children where the parent s .attr value is equal to what is being passed in the function

8996326
button	checkbox
desired outcome the desired outcome is that the user clicks on a button to submit which runs the function createrow and when they do it will check to see if the checkbox is checked and if it is it will only iterate through those items in the xml where the oadata value is equal to the value of the boxes that are checked

8996336
stdout	stderr
one other odd possibility is if your remote script.sh tries to write to stdin or dev tty instead of stdout stderr

8996339
width	height
css borders are applied to the full dimensions of an element and can t be applied to only a certain portion or by a certain width or height

8996345
int	chars
if you re tempted to reduce the width of the transactions table consider a small chars code instead of an int

8996345
int	chars
if a chars 2 code won t cover your anticipated values use an int and pay the price of a join to get human-readable values

8996350
folder	directory
it should be noted than i can change directory using the first command above and then create a test123 folder in both pdfcreator and design review folder

8996380
mouse	keyboard
the key window is the window that is currently accepting mouse and keyboard events

8996389
post	get
but some one just asked me what are the advantages of restful get over restful post

8996393
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it in google-chrome firefox and ie and it all works okay just a bit confused by the matter

8996405
uiview	calayer
uiview uses calayer in the background so you re using calayers in either case

8996405
uiview	calayer
note that there s a layer property in uiview of the type calayer

8996405
uiview	calayer
you can think uiview hides some of the calayer implementation details

8996438
keystore	jks
keystore type jks

8996458
google-chrome	firefox
to get a live view of the page you can either use firebug for firefox or if you re using google-chrome there are developer tools under the view menu that you can use to see how the html looks live

8996460
int	double
can someone show me how to use it with int and double

8996488
int	double
you need to convert them into int or double as required using integer.parseint value or double.parsedouble value

8996489
post	get
which of these two is get and which is post

8996497
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade to the 2.0wip versioning of bootstrap and i found a fork with the same name under

8996516
int	double
you have to use in-built methods to parse string into int and double

8996531
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
not that in ie the divs are centred not gap appears but in safari firefox google-chrome the problems occur

8996541
post	get
if i do make a new mode and get anywhere with it i ll post it here

8996573
width	height
this for example is why the defaults for the filter effects region are x -10 y -10 width 120 height 120

8996576
getter	setter
class defines the behavior and the members are the state of the object...so having a setter and a getter defines the encapsulation behavior of the class of letting others find change the objects state

8996592
width	height
then divide the #container .width and #container height by the applicable tiles and map out a js object to create a data grid and the expected width and height of each cell

8996626
terminate	timeout
ipn will not as far as i know report back to the site that the checkout session timeout or was terminate

8996652
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the javascript console in a modern browser like google-chrome or safari or with the firefox extension firebug is awesome

8996654
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i tested it offline with xampp and online in google-chrome safari firefox but nothing happens no error but no panel no gui

8996696
google-chrome	firefox
you can see it working correctly on google-chrome and firefox using css3 transitions

8996696
google-chrome	firefox
i want it to keep the fade even when i hover onto the project s title in the same fashion as it works in google-chrome and firefox

8996710
google-chrome	firefox
...in google-chrome s developer tools or firebug for firefox

8996716
google-chrome	safari
the same code works fine in safari and google-chrome

8996770
hide	show
now i only want to show the row with 1 visible collumn and hide the rest i.e i want to hide all rows except the first one still having the second and third collumn hidden how can i check if a table row have more than 1 visible collumn

8996796
touchesbegan	touchesended
then to detect a tap on the button you can just use the touchesbegan and touchesended i m pretty sure those aren t complete method names check in the docs for more info on them methods

8996809
verilog	vhdl
many designers write vhdl verilog instead of a high-level language for the same reasons that many programmers used to and still do in some cases write assembly instead of java you can tune resource usage and performance at a low level

8996809
verilog	vhdl
both vhdl and verilog are languages designed for designing hardware

8996809
verilog	vhdl
given enough time you could always write a program in vhdl verilog that will outperform a high-level language program

8996820
hash	md5
how can you create an md5 hash for a string on a mac using bash

8996839
hash	md5
if i create an md5 hash for a string on one cpmputer using a bash script will that same string create the same md5 hash if i were to cerate an md5 hash via a php script on another computer

8996839
hash	md5
that script will create an md5 hash for a user password

8996843
hash	md5
note md5 always produces the same hash

8996851
hash	salt
at least salt your hash

8996856
hash	salt
and as the comments above suggest you should always salt your hash to add an extra layer of security.

8996881
outputstream	inputstream
if you really wanted to test output though i m not sure if there s a lot of value you could add inputstream outputstream parameters to the method

8996881
outputstream	inputstream
output will then read from inputstream and write to outputstream

8996882
min	max
see if it s possible to limit number of rows by adding a max timestamp combined with your min timestamp

8996882
post	get
if none of the above help you immediately check out this post describing how to use a sub-query to get the count which avoids the group by altogether

maven-antrun-plugin	appassembler
the only way to do this is to process the file with another maven plugin like maven-antrun-plugin or assembly after running appassembler

8996947
tiff	ico	tiff	png	png	ico
if you re dealing with any png tiff or ico images and converting them to a format that doesn t support transparency you also need to call g.clear bgcolor prior to calling drawimage

8997018
post	get
when you get your post data run it through stripslashes

8997062
public	protected
regardless of philosophy a class outside of your implementation cannot access the private method without hacking the jvm so you re out of luck - you either have to change the method s visibility make a protected testing api the unit-test class extends or test the function indirectly by calling the public methods making use of it

8997074
awt	swing
pdfbox uses java awt and swing even for non ui tasks i ve tried to remove references but there are a lot of files and i was removing too much stuff

8997092
hash	salt
also as mitch wheat mentioned for password storage you really should salt the hash hash some random data together with the password then store the random data and the hash

8997113
public	protected
well i dont know what scott myers said but anyway by doing the way you specified a car method can only access the vehicle public methods and properties exactly the same way that you would be able if you created a vehicle object there are no protected methods and properties so there are no encapsulation breaking over here only if the base class is not correctly encapsulated

8997127
post	get
whether the request was a get or a post is nothing but a piece of data on the httpservletrequest object by the time it gets to you

8997133
post	get
patches for get and post

8997133
post	get
you will have to include those extra arguments or change this yourself to get the priority working with post and get requests

8997166
post	get
ex so once you get the post you can handle that programatically

8997214
mouse	keyboard
it can even do some non-network-related tasks like report input device keyboard mouse events

8997248
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
create java.util.date or java.util.calendar object set date value and use java.text.simpledateformat class method to format it

8997268
put	get
and put it in your db with the id _design yourapp then get it like this

8997269
maven	pom.xml
moreso because it s a maven.xml and not a pom.xml no reasonably old or recent ide can load the project up - i have to build it by hand running the maven script

8997269
versioning	upgrade
i ll freely admit i m fairly ignorant when it comes to java and maven but surely someone out there has to have some pointers on how i could upgrade to a more recent versioning of maven

8997278
post	get
5 once you get the post request to your page make the deletion before you do select queries

anyone can push and pull from any of the repos

8997456
qapplication	qwidget
the problem was that i initialize qapplication later than qwidget gets initialized

if i want to create three threads one for addition second for subtraction and third for multiplication i can simply do

8997619
subtraction	addition
see the example here i have created two threads t1 and t2 where t1 does the addition and t2 does the subtraction

8997685
margin	height
one of your issues was also that your footer needs to have the same total height as the negative margin of the wrapper

8997719
width	height
uc behaves as if it was newly created with width and height equal to 150px

8997771
matlab	s-function	matlab	simulink	s-function	simulink
for an s-function you need to make sure your c matlab or fortran code is where simulink expects it to be

8997822
portrait	landscape	oncreate	recreate
in android when the screen orientation changes between landscape and portrait the oncreate method is called which if not handled properly will recreate the entire activity when the result is too simply change the layout and retain all of the same information

8997855
post	get
it simply consists in redirecting after a successful post so that the user refresh results in an idempotent get to be done rather than a post

8997857
width	margin
one way to do that is to add it s width to your margin on the right like this

8997890
oncreate	ondestroy
when such a change occurs android restarts the running activity ondestroy is called followed by oncreate

8997929
disk	ram
note this is a hypothetical so don t bring up anything about premature optimization you d be better off to minimize disk i o before worrying about this depends on how much ram you have etc.

8997956
google-chrome	firefox
when submitting a form with javascript with onchange event google-chrome and firefox work but ie does not

8998032
rss	feed
so i have an rss feed application but am currently having some problems

8998141
width	height
i have a horizontal nav bar and my a elements are not expanding to be the width height of the parent li element

8998145
width	height
because the element is an inline element by default which means among many many other things you cannot give it a width or a height

8998157
width	height
it combines the best of both worlds - you can put them side-by-side without the need for float and give them whatever width and height you choose

8998162
put	get
moreover what is weird is that when i do step-by-step debugging with a breakpoint inside the thread where the image gets fetched from the internet the code runs fine and the image gets displayed but when i put the breakpoint further down outside the thread where the code to actually update the ui is the image does not get displayed as if this code is never reached

8998183
serializable	deserialization
by using the sqlxml class ado.net can communicate with sql server in this binary format and not require the database server to do any serializable or deserialization of xml

8998183
serializable	deserialization
however at worst instead of serializing to a string the message could instead be serializable to an xmldocument - which can then be passed to sqlxml through a new xmlnodereader - avoiding a deserialization serializable trip to a string

8998185
mkmapview	mkannotationview
i have set up an mkmapview with mkannotationview s for a bunch of locations

8998195
width	height
i don t get what you want to know clearly but in my case i try golovko fixedheader table and it works fine even with dynamic table except some bugs .if the table is static you can do with just css and js which control the height and width of table

8998228
google-chrome	firefox
i know i can do this for ie but what about for firefox or google-chrome

8998234
post	get
android sdk doesn t contain all the sources in order to get them all you need to use some tricks like described in this blog post

8998268
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
normally ejbs are hosted in an application server such as weblogic websphere jboss glassfish etc etc - when you deploy your ejb to one such server and start that server - server process is a jvm - meaning your server process that hosts your ejb is running in a jvm

8998268
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
now if you use a different java.exe say c jdk1.6 bin java.exe to run the client than the java.exe say c jdk1.5 bin java.exe used by your application server you are using two different jvms

8998280
post	get
i am guessing this should be done in a php post or get variable

8998280
post	get
i can grab the topic from the post or get variable and then run the rest of my site

8998280
post	get
as of now the only way i have passed post or get variables was from forms on the previous page

8998289
equals	gethashcode
you also need to override the gethashcode and equals methods from the object class

8998309
post	get
you should probably use get because it sounds like you re just trying to display different information and post is supposed to be for performing changes or actions

8998311
for-loop	arrays
i was thinking about two weeks ago and coded a very similar game in c and after some if-else-if-else terrible spaghetti i ended up thinking in put the paths and choices each one in one different arrays and then run a for-loop for each interation and checking in arrays correct answer or not left or right and then extract the point on the other arrays to go allowing the next movement

8998311
for-loop	arrays
so u have choices arrays and paths arrays and the for-loop realize all interations with minimal code

8998330
min	max
create 3 class level properties of max min and avg

8998378
gmail	hotmail
in browsers and outlook it s working nicely but in gmail hotmail and ymail it shows links underlined

8998490
getter	setter
the private setter allows the property to only be set internally to the class while the getter still exposes the property value publicly

8998512
public	protected
the private modifier allows the property to be read-only in the context of public protected or internal access while giving the type itself the ability to set the property in the context of private access

8998592
inherited	properties
for example you may decide that all your view models will expose a showprogressbar properties which can be bound to a progress bar on your page or you may decide to create a progressviewmodelbase or iallowprogress that you inherited implement in pages that require progress bars

8998596
range	minimum
in my experience using ses the minimum api response time i ve seen has been in the half second range while the average hovered around one second

8998603
public	protected
to only call public package protected methods of your code

8998631
accessor	properties
another benefit in some situations is after giving a private set to your properties you can give a set method for changing the properties value from external world when you want to do some calculations or validations on the value received which is not a best practice to do inside the set properties accessor and then change the value of the properties as follows

8998647
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

rtsp has rtp and rtcp.but when i try to create a socket connection which waits for rtp packets an exception throws

8998786
rtp	rtsp
can t i receive rtp even-though the phone supports rtsp

8998844
post	get
this is most likely because you re accessing indexes that don t exist in your post or get variable

8998859
getter	setter
take a java bean setter and getter methods class

8998864
post	put	post	get	put	get
not only http get request i need to generate dynamic post put request in some manners

8998864
post	put
there are many tools but i couldn t find right tool for generating post put request with non-static data

8998864
post	put	post	get	put	get
ability to write the custom request for http get post and put

8998864
post	put	post	get	put	get
based on certain condition the request generator needs to parse json document in the http body and process it to make another get post put request

8998895
cpu	affinity
we know how to change a threads affinity and we know that there is no guarantee that a thread will remain associated with any cpu although in this particular case the thread s eating up cpu remain associated with only one cpu but in order to do so we need to first determine which process thread needs to be relocated

8998935
affinity	processors
by default threads have no affinity can operate on any processors

8998987
cgpoint	cgrect
as far as i understood from your hints above you may use nsvalue to store cgpoint and cgrect in collection

8999010
versioning	upgrade
the best way to do it would be to upgrade to the latest versioning of joomla and use the built in acl to control what is displayed

8999062

8999081
128bit	64bit
is this the right way to implement sha-512 on 64bit architecture or is there any way to cater 128bit values on 64bit architectures that i dont know

8999083
stdout	stderr
redirect the process s stdout and stderr to a file which you can watch for activity

8999104
hash	md5
supplies a reference to the modified dates for all groups through assetmanager .cachetimestamps groupname as well as md5 hash assetmanager .cachehashes groupname which can be used for cache invalidation in templates

8999107
exif	xmp
png format files may use xmp metadata not exif

8999113

filesystems	fat
if a have a fat filesystems implemented in a sdram memory block on a blackfin 537 board how could i write a file to that memory filesystems

8999235
integer	unsigned
simply write __int128 for a signed 128-bit integer or unsigned __int128 for an unsigned 128-bit integer

8999278
post	get
we can make both get and post methods

8999311
google-chrome	firefox
first off try to debug your code - google-chrome has a neat console built-in ctrl + shift + j and firefox has the awesome firebug addon

8999311
submit	submission
apart from you can use #contactform submit and passing no event handler actually triggers the submission of the form this works for all other events too

8999371
mouseout	mouseleave
the mouseout or mouseleave of the black bordered box event is fired

8999484
google-chrome	firefox
we are calling the java script functions in code behind to refresh the parent window by using page.clientscript.registerstartupscript .but t is working fine in ie internet explorer but not working in mozilla firefox and google-chrome

8999511
hide	show
rather than moving html around and duplicating and replacing content i d just create the content once and hide it then show it with an animation

8999528
versioning	upgrade
try clearing the option always upgrade to the installed versioning of office

8999529
implements	extends
this class may extends any other class only 1 and implements as many interfaces as needed

8999564
geocoding	geocode
i just want to confirm that using the near method provided by the geocode gem when longitude and latitudes are provided does not make an external call to the google geocoding api

8999573
memcached	apc
you may try apc or memcached

8999614
implements	extends
in java while 1 class can only ever extends 1 base class it can implements multiple interfaces

8999630
getter	setter
as per my knowledge property is used in .h file as a setter method and synthesize in .m file as getter method

8999630
getter	setter
in java we use setter and getter methods same as java in objective c we use property and synthesize

8999666
dependencyobject	freezable
cannot use a dependencyobject that belongs to a different thread than its parent freezable

8999698
queue	fifo
usually a more appropriate collection type for the producer consumer pattern is a queue a fifo collection instead of a list

8999702
google-chrome	firefox
to complete guffa answer if you cannot use server side preprocessing and you have to target only firefox and google-chrome you can also use

8999736
mouseout	mouseleave
also using mouseout means that when the mouseleave the selected element or any of that elements children the event is triggered

8999761
post	put
if you don t know how put a comment on this post and i ll add the source code to do it

8999778
post	get
the key is sent to the server as a post get parameter it is up to the server what to do with the key

8999778
post	get
like any other post get parameter the key is sent as a string so unless your web framework knows how to decode the post get parameters into objects the key will be in string format

8999826
integer	unsigned
however a 64 bit unsigned integer is good enough for the intended purpose and simplifies the counting

8999874
super	implements
here your super car can implements bounceable

8999886
integer	unsigned
but you are asking printf to print 4294967296 which is beyond the maximum possible unsigned integer for your implementation

8999941
google-chrome	firefox
this works also in ie9 firefox and google-chrome

8999943
getter	setter
i think every section should be presented by the class and each option should have corresponding property getter and maybe setter

8999943
implements	extends
i need something like design pattern general idea template how to implements this so it was high quality easy to manage and extends

8999994
for-loop	arrays
if so what is the best way of initializing for-loop and manual assignment or defining values when i declare the players arrays through the use of braces

pull	push
personally i find that writing a pipeline of filters works much better with a push model than a pull model although both are possible

9000018
pull	push
intrinsically the job it is doing is very simple a loop that reads events from the pull input and writes events to the push output

9000023
post	get
i d like to get all created_times of all likes of a post

9000061
memset	calloc
the best way to initialize is to just create a for-loop or memset everything to zero or use calloc which is the easiest

9000067
hide	show
i have also a button which hide and show my uipickerviewer

9000072
multiplying	add

put	get
i can correctly retrieve the value of e.item. mystr.tostring a numeric value but if i try to put it in a variable i get the error in the title

9000112
x86	64bit
i m not familiar with this assembly but if it s pre-compiled to x86 in the gac then you ll need to load it with 32bit powershell when on a 64bit windows system

9000121
children	parent
that s why only a parent window may close its children windows

9000207
width	height
i don t know what the parameters for rectangle are supposed to mean but i assume the first two are positions and the last two width and height

9000248
google-chrome	firefox
oddly this issue only happens in ie8 and doesn t happen in google-chrome firefox ie7 or ie9

9000275
post	get
edited after seeing axtaxt s post the problem you describe here cannot be accomplished with a normal sort because it s always possible to construct a scenario where by these rules you get a loop in your sort hierarchy

9000285
uiview	calayer
i m struggling to find the missing piece in my code.i have a class which derives from uiview customview and also have a class that derives from calayer customlayer and implements the drawlayer incontext delegate method of the calayer class.i do that because i want to use the customlayer as a clipping mask and so i need the drawlayer incontext method which is not called when i start the application

9000288
hide	show
the simple way i found is to use 2 menu items and show one hide the other and then the opposite

9000294
uiview	subviews
iterating over all uiview in the subviews of a class and then checking the type in the loop using iskindofclass made my code look redundant

9000297
tcpdf	fpdf
somewhat good news you could move to tcpdf which is much better at handling utf8 and is more modern in general than fpdf

9000319

rss	feed
i am running some federated searches each of which use their own xslt for transforming rss feed but i cannot see a simple way to debug the xslt in real time

9000340
google-chrome	firefox
if i test this with a 15 seconds cache period and i just set the maxage and mustrevalidate it seems to work fine with ie9 firefox and google-chrome

9000345
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseenter and mouseleave events aren t propagating on all the overlaying dom elements as you would expect

9000368
rss	feed
apply your xslt ops on the innermost html element containing rss feed content

9000376
uiview	subviews
something like lineview extends uiview and then make lineview the exact dimensions of the line i want to draw fill it using its own drawrect method and then add an instance of lineview to myview as a subviews

9000407
free	malloc
having said all that if a call to malloc failed don t be surprised if subsequent calls to free also fail

is this the safe way to prevent and cron jobs would not work if i use the above code so what can i use to secure value from end user

9000563
oncreate	ondestroy
so in order to resolve it i written code which will set the wifi sleep policy to never and acquire the partial lock in the oncreate method of background service and releasing the lock in ondestroy method of the service.now observation is for some time it is working fine means for 5 or 10 mins thereafter again it stop communicating

9000596
children	parent
i expect the parentid should point to parent organizationstructure and childrenitems should point to children oranizationstructures

9000609
folder	directory
the data in i have in the tempdeploy folder is the result of running the mono develop deploy to the web option to that directory

9000638
profiling	debugging
i use nhibernate profiling to debugging things like that

9000645
trie	tree
a. use a standard trie instead of a ternary tree so your seek time will be considered constant no matter how many items you have in the trie

9000695
16-bit	64bit
the language requires that int is at least 16-bit long int is at least 32 bits and long long int is at least 64bit but each can be wider

according to the maven pom.xml intro page the relativepath attribute is to be used when you have a parent pom.xml project located in a different-than-normal location where normal is .. pom.xml

9005499
profiler	visualvm
your fear is probably well founded pooling reduces garbage collection and pause times for socket connects but i would highly advise checking your assumptions against a profiler like visualvm

9005509
width	height
giving a print-ticket with the exact width and height avoids scaling that was i wanted in my case

9005510
post	get
you will get a viewstate validation error if the page that your form post to does not match the page that generated the viewstate

9005517
textview	imageview
i m trying to use a gridview with an imageview and a textview inside each cell

9005519
mouseout	mouseenter
normally should be executed after the animation is done but i am looking in the developer tools chrome when doing mouseenter and mouseout but the css does not change.

9005555
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
basically the method uses a for-loop to add the guessed characters into a character arrays and every time the player guesses it checks to see if that character is there if it is it breaks out of loops and if not and the index value is 0 this means it s unwritten right

9005578
getter	setter
i have a model pojo called usermodel that has getter and setter for username and password

9005607
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
when linux passes it usually does not help you in analysis only when freebsd win32 or solaris pass then you got some certainty of correctness

9005652
folder	directory
i had added a main folder that had other directory under it

9005693
cpu	affinity
if you need to pin-point specific a thread or a process you can only assign its affinity so you can have reasonable hope that the process thread will be executed on a particular logical cpu

9005698
gtk	clutter
if this is correct will clutter replace gtk someday

9005753
factors	matrix
for each eigenvector the corresponding eigenvalue is the factors by which the eigenvector is scaled when multiplied by the matrix

9005758
inline	inlining
the compiler may alleviate some of this through inlining the functions which you could incentize by adding the inline keyword to the definitions

9005759
entities	entitymanager
and i ve got two entitymanager that contain different entities different modules of one application and both point to the same datasource

9005778
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to create an arrays of arrays with a for-loop

9005785
post	get
i need to get selected checkbox values in post actionmethod as well

9005867
put	get
so no matter what i put in it i get messages like

9005885
for-loop	arrays
note that you are pushing the same arrays into super_array for each iteration in the for-loop

9005900
superclass	subclassing
a single object is created - but that object is an instance of both the superclass and the subclassing and java.lang.object itself

9005901
aggregate-functions	sum
any query using aggregate-functions sum mixed with non-aggregated fields computerid must use a group by clause

9005922
opera	safari
i looked at developer toolbar opera s dev tool firebug safari s dev tool and analyzed each button

9005922
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
why is it that firefox and ie cause the button to change so dramatically while safari google-chrome and opera keep the look and feel exactly the same

9005947
int	double
it generates random double and int and send them to server

9006014
int	chars
one possible solution is to use the int value of an chars because every letter is represented by a number

9006032
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol with multiple tabitem

9006037
button	checkbox
what i m trying to do is that when at least one checkbox in my page is checked a button should be enable or disable if none of the checkbox are checked

9006055
versioning	upgrade
so it might be necessary to upgrade your versioning of bnd or use a plugin that supports blueprint

9006078
getter	setter
i want to write an aspect that will generate getter setter for the fields of a class where it is being used

9006123
hide	show
you can use .show and hide after animation complete and show hide respective content

9006126
getter	setter
if you could generate getter setter in runtime.

9006126
getter	setter
as in eclipse source menu - generate getter setter

9006148
put	get
you could use a uinavigationcontroller to manage your screens -- do a push to put up each view then do a pop to root controller to get back to the beginning

9006159
outputstream	inputstream
i think is the same thing that asking how can i transform an outputstream to an inputstream

9006181
tabcontrol	tabitem
this is weird standard behaviour of tabcontrol - it is unload items whilst switching so you have to extend it slightly to keep cached tabitem whilst switching see more details with an example in this article keeping the wpf tab control from destroying its children

9006202
getter	setter
it generates getter setter and various other handy methods

9006293
mouse	keyboard
3 better would be redirect reading for file contents to the backgroung task swingworker or runnable#thread then jbutton and jlabel will be changed and gui would be during background task responsible for mouse or keyboard

9006325
post	get
wp looks to the trash to prevent duplicate permalinks and until that post is deleted you will get the -2 type permalinks

9006351
google-chrome	firefox
i m on win xp but this problem occurs on firefox ie and google-chrome

9006396
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
install and use graphicsmagick or imagemagick from php

9006437
uiview	subviews
the idea was find the uiview of keyboard and add the button like a subviews

9006441
subplot	imshow
with regard to displaying both images side-by-side you can use subplot in conjunction with your calls to imshow

9006491
hash	md5
if you want the fastest encryption algorithm then there s no substitute for testing it yourself - somewhat strangely php s sha1 implementation is significantly faster than its md5 i know these are hash - this is to illustrate that performance depends on implementation as much as algorithm

9006491
client-side	server-side
why not just use a server-side session with a random value sent client-side you don t have to use the php session handler if you want to implement a remember me type function and still have a conventional session

9006494
portrait	landscape
when testing my application at wxga720 resolution on the android emulator running 4.0.3 ice cream sandwich my app takes the layout assets from the layout-normal-land-854x480 folder in landscape view and the layout-port-480x320 folder for portrait view

9006503
width	margin
one way to kind of achieve the layout you want is to stop floating .productdetailspanel and give it a left margin of 25 the width of .categorypanel plus spacing between them

9006610
websphere	ibm
i am building a java application that should be able to connect to an ibm websphere mq queue manager and i cannot understand why i keep getting this error

9006626
autocomplete	multi-select
try chosen a neat jquery and or prototype plugin to style your drop-downs including tokenization aka multi-select fuzzy autocomplete etc

9006631
tcpdf	fpdf
i am generating a reporting using both fpdf and tcpdf for comparison sack

9006631
tcpdf	fpdf
what i notice is fpdf took nearly 40seconds but tcpdf took nearly 3minutes and 20seconds

9006643
sorting	filtering
the problem is that in our callback function the l2e query is actually executed on the db before any filtering sorting and paging has been performed by the devexpress grid

9006643
sorting	filtering
skip 10 rows and take 10 in the l2e query when the user selects page 2 instead of selecting 100000 rows if there are that many in the table and afterwards applying the filtering sorting paging like in the described situation

9006651
portrait	landscape
when testing my application at wgxa720 resolution on the android emulator running 4.0.3 ice cream sandwich my app takes the layout assets from the layout-normal-land-854x480 folder in landscape view and the layout-port-480x320 folder for portrait view

9006654
ivar	nsmutableset
in the header file declare the ivar like nsmutableset buttonsset then in the class implementation

9006696
put	get
the other challenging part is if you insert an element in a spot where it doesn t belong or put an invalid attribute on an element you will get a corrupt file when you try and open it

9006708
put	get
these are set up to handle all verbs but to 405 to everything except get and head because that is the default iis behaviour for static files is to refuse to allow them to be posted to or put to or deleted

9006708
post	get
then try debugging it with a simple html form that post appropriate data or even inappropriate data so you can at least get an error message about the data being wrong rather than it ending up somewhere that refuses to handle post at all

9006720
sorting	filtering
i would implement the paging sorting filtering in the data access layer level and return only what needs to be shown because the grid as you noticed can show the right page but this happens client side and everything is always loaded from the database except if you use their xpo orm which i dont and enable the grid server-mode at least this is the concept in their windows forms and asp.net grid

9006755
google-chrome	firefox
in ie7 8 but not firefox and google-chrome the space between the child li elements provided by the line margin 0.25em 0 0 0

9006796
many-to-one	one-to-many
i have many-to-one mappings working fine but a one-to-many relationship between locations and location_times keeps giving me an error

9006805
min	max
for example we have usagerange type that have two properties min max

9006805
getter	setter
and it is widely used on many tables and have some logic inside getter setter

9006821
folder	directory
we run a website that has an english version in the root directory and a czech version in a folder called cs

9006825
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
but there is some performance glitch under some browsers google-chrome mac windows opera mac ie paradoxically not safari

9006875
stdout	stderr
nslog also writes to stderr while printf writes to stdout

9006876
submit	submission
my intended functionality is for the ajax form to submit without the whole form submission and populate with data that i queried

9006881
try-catch	exception-handling
a while-loop ensures that the input value stays between x and y and my try-catch is supposed to throw an exception-handling if the user enters an invalid variable user enters e when the program expects an integer

9006881
min	max
here is my code when i run it everything runs fine except for when i try to enter an invalid variable for example if i enter e or then my program just loops the code nslog enter a number between i and i min max infinitely

9006893
vimeo	flickr
one i tried was this which iâ m using to extract the vimeo thumbnail so therefor i thought i would work on the flickr thumbnail

9006946
opera	google-chrome
see here for a demo google-chrome or opera

9007016
post	get
looking through other post on here i ve found the following code to get the list of ips for the interfaces on a system

9007029
put	get
in the first approach we put every new candidate into single data structure and that s bad because too many things get mixed up unwisely

9007038
cpu	processors
the first type is when the cpu does not have the virtual-physical mapping in the tlb - the processors invokes the pagefault software interrupt in the os the os puts the mapping into the processors for that process then the proc re-runs the offending instructions

9007058
gtk	cairo
yes cairo is a high quality 2d drawing api and gtk uses cairo to draw itself

9007058
clutter	cairo
clutter uses cogl for rendering but it can also use cairo for 2d elements

9007058
gtk	clutter
clutter will not replace gtk gtk is a very complex library that provides system integration complex widgets and other utility api that clutter has no interest in providing

9007058
gtk	gdk	gtk	clutter	clutter	gdk
clutter can use gdk the gtk windowing system api to talk to the windowing system surfaces and get input events

9007058
gtk	clutter
in the future it s entirely possible that gtk will use clutter internally as the base for its widgets - though that s still a work in progress

9007084
apache	nginx
if it isn t possible by mod_auth_kerb but possible by some other apache or nginx mod it is totally ok

9007109
src	attr
you d need to call replace on this attr src no

9007122
google-chrome	firefox
tested with ie8 google-chrome and firefox

9007126
qstring	qbytearray
however there is another serious issue in your code which is that you are trying to convert from a qbytearray the result of readall to a qstring

9007140
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works perfectly in ie and firefox but will not work in google-chrome or safari webkit

9007196
puts	putchar
simply printing it all a la putchar c puts the exact same character at the end of the line

9007217
public	protected
or if the id is a protected public variable

9007217
public	protected
or even call your own method protected public

9007243
multiplying	add
i am pretty confident that you are dealing with strings based on the slicing you use in your example but if row.getvalue ld_mcpi returns an int you can multiplying it by 1000 to add the three zeros

9007245
accessor	properties
the retain is done by the synthesized properties accessor method

9007292
hash	md5
so i thought of using a hashing function like sha or md5 to hash the identifiers i get then use them as ids for my spans and i can apply the hashing function again to find my element

9007319
hide	show
these statments are used to show or hide columns in a grid run queries to return data and any other restrictions needed

9007337
put	get
if you don t get a permission which is not critical and inputsimulation is far to dangerous a permission imho to be considered critical to put the camera away run but inform the user at the appropriate time that s he has to do some manual stuff

9007348
listener	eventhandler
another way as implementing inner actionlistener with setactioncommand string actioncommand for whole jmenu is wrote java.swing.action for each of jmenuitem or implements eventhandler seems like as valid for all listener that i tried

9007348
listener	eventhandler
example about jbuttons and with implemented actionlistener and eventhandler both listener firing events

9007367
portrait	landscape
im developing an application to display a gallery of images by using a uiscrollview the sliding between images works fine on portrait mode but when changed to landscape mode it shows the image plus a portion of the next image

9007387

9007452
typedef	struct
in my code i have typedef struct to represent the particle and a set of vectors to represent the particle s velocity acceleration and position

9007461
httprequest	httpresponse
httpcontext httprequest httpresponse etc

9007461
mvp	presenter
to summarize in the mvp design model the presenter is handling the work that might be handled by the view in the mvc design model

9007474
submit	submission
i suspect the reason that it s not submission is because the element in the page isn t a form element and doesn t have an associated submit action

9007476
entities	entitymanager
using an lifecycle event listener you can access the entitymanager and delete those entities too

9007483
free	malloc
for every memory region that you malloc you re responsible for free ing it yourself

9007526
min	max
this function returns an array of pretty y axis values that encompass the min and max y values passed in

9007529
free	malloc
in order to free memory you must use the free function after you ve allocated with malloc

9007529
free	malloc
so the answer is if is the only pointer to space you ve previously allocated with malloc you must release the memory with free before you assign to that pointer as that will mean you no longer have any pointer to that space and that is a memory leak

9007532
free	malloc
if you re not using malloc you must not use free

9007532
free	malloc
if you ve used malloc you have to use free

9007576
filtering	grouping
i want vertically grouping checkboxes with a search filtering

9007576
filtering	grouping
is there a way to style a regular search filtering list to look like vertically grouping checkboxes

9007576
filtering	grouping
can i add the search filtering to the grouping of checkboxes

9007604
min	max
as for the min max part simply write the appropriate comparator classes

9007624
post	get
for some odd reason by design or omission on facebook s part using the graph api to get at public post using a user access token just doesn t want to work

9007638
versioning	upgrade
you have to upgrade your java versioning to 1.6 minimum

lwp protocol https socket ssl connect attempt failed with unknown

9007739
libstdc++	libc++
current libc++ gives the same results on your test as libstdc++

9007761
namedtuple	dictionary
if for some reason you still need to access the rows as a collections.namedtuple it should be easy to transform the dictionary to namedtuple as follows

9007784
matplotlib	scipy
it has python matplotlib numpy scipy and many other packages precompiled and has an osx 64 bit version

9007795
google-chrome	firefox
ecmascript 5 will let you pass array-like objects but it only seems to work in firefox at the moment and not ie9 or google-chrome

notice i got the width and height from the iframe code

9007847
udp	tcp
i was reading about tcp and udp socket programming

9007854
qapplication	qwidget
one possible reason for qwidget constructor failing is that you have forgot to initialize the qapplication object

9007864
post	get
can someone just post an example code to get constant vars like this from a php file

9007933
mdpi	hdpi
afaik 1dp equals 1 real pixel for mdpi density 1.5 for hdpi and 2.0 for xhdpi

9007947
getter	setter
one way to do it write getter setter functions

9007969
queue	fifo
it is a queue list like data structure with a fifo data access model but rather than being actually fifo it rather returns the object of greatest priority first

9007980

have you tried replacing the ä s with their octal or hex escapes

9008107
apache	nginx
with local development you ll need to setup some sort of apache nginx setup with a locally signed cert bolted on

9008108
heapsort	in-place
if you only care about the big-o complexity the answer is o n log n and you can probably get more concrete bounds some actual constants in there if you look at the analysis of some efficient in-place sorting algorithms like heapsort or smoothsort

9008128
min	max
start with a pairs of numbers and find local min and max n 2 comparisons

9008128
min	max
next find global max from n 2 local maxes n 2 comparisons and similarly global min from local mins n 2 comparisons

9008148
for-loop	arrays
the problem is that i m getting the received packet as an arrays so the length 0x0a01 would be 0x0a on lets say 1 and 0x01 on 2 and i want them both to be 0a01 in one var so i can run a compare to a constant or use in a for-loop

9008180
post	get
i have found several post discussing how to get htaccess to only allow images out disable php output scripts in plain text form.

9008193
width	height
also you may need to give your body an explicit width and height iirc ie will collapse it otherwise

9008199
portrait	landscape
i m wondering why ipad project based on uitabbarcontroller won t autorotate when i specify some of the tab should autorotate in landscape mode and the other will autorotate in landscape and portrait mode

9008199
portrait	landscape
in the other hand if the uiviewcontroller should rotate in landscape and portrait i ve just return yes

post	put
for a form submit with post you can add to the end of the input name to put it in an array

9008377
dbcontext	objectcontext
yes i know dbcontext doesn t support stored procs which is why t4 template uses the iobjectcontextadapter to convert it to an objectcontext

9008426
post	get
i get the post back from the edit view page

9008440
width	height
the pixelmap is going into a writeablebitmap in silverlight - which once constructed takes a 1d array as a pixel source since height width is passed into the constructor

9008457
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also noticed that it will sometimes run successfully if i switch to an open google-chrome browser and then back to the firefox browser while it s running

9008507

are you using debian ubuntu or some other debian derivative

9008541
getter	setter
currently have this code defining getter setter for an object s selectedid property

9008581
google-chrome	firefox
you could observe what requests are made when you click the button using firebug in firefox or developer tools in google-chrome

9008594
hash	md5
just use an md5 hash on the actual file after it s been uploaded and stored

9008614

9008749
mouseleave	mouseenter
event can be mouseenter mouseleave click etc

9008780
post	get
pcapperf - get http waterfall charts from your mobile device connected to a wifi hotspot blog post open source

google-chrome	safari
you can use google-chrome devtools with an android device and you can use safari devtools on a mac with an ios device

9008813
put	get
this worked fairly well because i could put everything in there and then get at more than just one namespace

9008830
dns	spf
if you just use an unconfigured service to send your emails you will definitely end up in the spam folder due to reverse dns and spf checks failing

9008916
concave	convex
the generated polygons could be either convex or concave but for larger numbers of desired sides they will almost certainly be concave

9008925

send ajax request with post and or get data to url responsible for adding friends eg mysupersocialnetwork.org friend add

9008938
submit	submission
so i tried to do the following for programmatically checking the condition before submission the form but when i use the following code it doesn t even submit the form which was being done by

9008938
submit	submission
is it possible to programmatically submit the form just like it works for manual form submission where it checks for a condition before submission the form

9008989
vertica	infobright
there is a lot of confusion about when to use a row database like mysql or oracle or a columnar db like infobright or vertica or a nosql variant or hadoop

9009016
redhat	fedora
for instructions for centos redhat fedora see compile ffmpeg on centos 6.0

9009016
ffmpeg	libvpx
or just download a build of ffmpeg that has libvpx support

9009020
config	ini
a config ini file i would recommend using a java properties file

9009037
zlib	crypto++
i am getting a strange error with valgrind on a program that makes use of crypto++ s zlib functions

9009042
division	modulo
use modulo and division

9009049
post	get
by using a main script and including the file by switching on some post get param your sending could be a random string hash number

9009067
division	modulo
use integer division to find your number of groups and the modulo to find out how many inserts are in your last set

9009086
spaces	delimiter
if you modify the default delimiter you will have to add spaces around your delimiter from then on otherwise the parser chokes

9009126
awt	swing
swing has superseded the original awt so it would still be a good idea to use japplet in lieu of applet simply for keeping up with the current libraries

9009138
awt	swing
applet is awt whereas japplet is swing japplet is the extended version of applet therefore it is more recent

9009139
multiplication	modulo
can i optimise multiplication modulo p much like exponentiation modulo p is optimised with pow a b p

9009156

9009226
min	max
min max sum etc

9009244

i have one use case that might be valid what if you load some data from the internet whether it is xml from an rss feed or wsdl response then flatten those responses into a tabular from generating an in memory data table and finally mash it all up into a single coherent data model then you can create the entities for those in memory data tables and create master detail relationships

google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome 16 and firefox 8 the session id is the same between http and https

9010721
getter	setter
i also find that the hype over only use direct access in init dealloc use setter getter everywhere else to be largely overblown and thus just use the setter getter everywhere

9010721
getter	setter	ivar	subclassing
as caleb points out another reason to use direct ivar access in init dealloc is to avoid subclassing that implement custom setter getter logic that may barf due to the undefined state of the object during init dealloc

9010721
getter	setter
while this may be true i consider it a nasty architectural flaw to implement setter getter with custom behavior

9010721
getter	setter
if your setter and getter are written such that cannot be executed at any time on foo then your code is busted

9010724

superclass	subclassing
in the example below only the fields and setters annotated with inject in mywidget and its superclass will be injected - it won t know to look for subclassing as well

9010981
xslt	xquery
if you only have xs sequence to worry about and not choice repetition and so long as the schema isn t written to use lots of complex features like named model groups and substitution groups and wildcards then it shouldn t be too difficult at any rate if you use xslt 2.0 or xquery and forget about trying to code it in java

9010995
google-chrome	firefox
i ve checked this in firebug on google-chrome and firefox

9010998
folder	directory
however some hosting companies think it is safer for php to execute as a generic user nobody apache etc. this means that the user php runs as is not the user that owns the folder you are trying to write to so the other group on that folder needs write permissions 777 to be able to write to that directory

hash	salt
always store a password in a database using only a hash of the pasword and a randomly generated salt googling for these terms combined with php should yield some useful results

9011231

median	max
i want to export only the pdl function from pdl to avoid namespace collision with other automatically exported functions such as max median sum intersect etc

9011254

you will need a loops an if-statement and another loops

9011368
inherited	properties
the product entity maps to 7 or 8 tables and has about 50 properties each type that inherited from a product has some 5 to 20 extra properties that extend a product

9011404
inherited	subclassing
as i perceive it defining a subclassing for each feature and then using multiple inherited to bring the desired interfaces together is not sufficient

9011438
mouseleave	mouseenter
to make this functions like mouseenter or mouseleave in the loaded content possible

9011449
google-chrome	safari
in short log errors with console.log if available then fix the errors using your debugger of choice firebug webkit developer tools built-in to safari and google-chrome ie developer tools or visual studio

9011450
folder	directory
i am not sure but the reason of the error might be that i added the folder c program files microsoft sdks windows v7.1 include to the included directory at the project settings and visual studio already included the folder c program files x86 microsoft sdks windows v7.0a include which is for the 32 bit programs by default

9011450
x86	64bit
i added the opengl header files only to the program files x86 include folder removed the include for 64bit program files folder and the opengl code seems to be working now

9011509
int	chars
void permute chars pool int pool_length int num_picked chars stringy

9011514
width	height
simply do the same math you did with keepaspectratio but this time keep the height instead of the width

9011514
width	height
this makes it easy to multiply the values with your width height

9011514
min	max
just replace max with min

9011514
width	height
for your case you d just have to multiply the resulting texture coordinates with your width height

9011519

the user can choose one favorite color via a radio button then they can choose multiple secondary colors via checkbox in case their favorite color is out of stock

i m not a programmer but i ve put together a site that uses fancy box and all is good in google-chrome and firefox but ie8 ie9 are a disaster

9011558
post	get
1 for the syntax to get a json asmx service to work take a look at this post

9011567
button	checkbox
the entire label is being used as a shortcut to the radio button so clicking the checkbox which is inside the label as well will activate the label and also the radio button

9011576
button	checkbox
clicking anywhere on the label selects the radio button including the checkbox you have inside the as well

9011596
required	placeholder
to be honest it looks like this is a placeholder block to be used if required

9011597
cs-cart	smarty
i m working with a shopping cart cs-cart that uses smarty templates

9011607
public	protected
you may have to create a class and inherit from whatever class you re using which inherits from listview i m assuming this because if you were using the listview class directly then you would probably have access to the underlying cache and the mechanisms to get the item at a particular index would be manifest create a public wrapper function call the protected onretrievevirtualitem function with the parameter you specified in your example code and the return the .item from there so

9011608
folder	directory
on the other hand if you want to run it from windows say from a cmd.exe command prompt then the .sh extension is used by windows to determine how to execute it and you can invoke it as rd if a it s in a directory in your path and b windows is configured in folder options and or by setting pathext to use sh or bash to launch .sh files

9011621
opensuse	linux
i am using gcc suse linux 4.6.2 on opensuse 12.1 asparagus i586

how can i reset file input in ie i used the following and it worked in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

9011657
post	put
the problem seems to be with all tests that do post put delete requests

9011686
onfling	gestures
there s a few issues with the webview and gesturedetectors - try always returning false in your onfling .. method instead of true - using a gestures detector in the fashion you do is known to block pretty basic stuff such as even updating the currently displayed page

9011693
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox and it should work perfectly in internet explorer

9011780
valgrind	memcheck
at alanxz s suggestion i ve run the standalone version of the code under valgrind memcheck helgrind and drd tools

9011854
16-bit	64bit
back when the natural-size on 16-bit machines was well 16-bit of course the balance went more in favour of going for the natural size than today when we ve 32-bit and 64bit machines

9011854
unsigned	short
firstly though we tend to use signed more than unsigned values which would lean us toward short but also ushort is not a cls-compliant type and there s hardly any point introducing an incompatibility with other .net languages in obtaining compatibility with com

9011891
put	get
if you don t do anything the app will get put to sleep anyway and won t execute any code

9011892
sendkeys	msgbox
-threading and sendkeys i was also unable to get the msgbox to respond to sendkeys

9011964
width	margin
set the width of the others margin s padding s etc and float them

9011987
getter	setter
locking inside the getter or setter won t help because that lock s scope exists entirely within one of the steps either 1 or 3

9012017
xslt	xquery
then you can use other libraries like saxon to execute xpath xslt or xquery against that xml tree

9012029
draggable	droppable
i have tried using draggable droppable so that the card is not initially confined to sortables but i still cannot get it to recognize where the card is

9012029
draggable	droppable
i m also thinking that draggable droppable will not be what i need because then i cannot move the card from a sortable back to original listing draggable

9012052
post	get
here is a modified version that sends a byte array to the server as far as you can get the image bytes you can use this to send them to the server as an attached image to the post request

9012134
atomic	interlocked
using the interlocked class provides for atomic operations inherently threadsafe as in this linqpad example

9012156
post	get
my problem is that when i try to post i get a js error because some of the vars are undefined

9012192
rtsp	rtmp
ideally i would like to show the video in player like jwplayer however it does not support rtsp protocol but rtmp instead

9012192
rtsp	rtmp
1 transcode the video stream from rtsp - rtmp

9012201
post	get
should i add the below check on the post version of the edit action method also in addtion to the get version or it will be considered as unnecessary check

9012207
stdout	stderr
we would like to be able to output stdout to another file either a csv or txt and we would also like to be able to output stderr to null or a seperate file so we can inspect it later

9012223
post	put
i am very new to backbone.js and i am trying to figure out why changes in the page s form fields are not being sent in post put requests

9012275
strcpy	strncpy
use strcpy or strncpy function to copy a string in an array of char

9012290
for-loop	loops
change the for-loop to a while loops and only increment if

9012292
concave	convex
if the polygon is concave let s call an edge a concave edge if it s not on the convex hull of the polygon

9012293
width	height
clone the div incrementally strip words out until the clone s height width becomes less than the original s

9012318
for-loop	loops
although it s not strictly illegal in java it s not a good idea to change the value of the for-loop control variable from within loops

9012318
for-loop	loops
by changing loops iteration variable within loops you re messing with the implicit assumptions offered by your use of a for-loop

9012330
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if the redirects are simple redirects url1 to url2 no regex etc and you have access to httpd.conf then you could use a rewritemap for all the redirects and possibly have just 1 rule in your .htaccess to handle these

9012331
equals	gethashcode
it makes sense to me we re overriding gethashcode to return a value based on two properties that if match the two objects should be treated as equals

9012342
typedef	struct
for convenience you can combine the struct declaration and the typedef into one block

9012356
equals	gethashcode
based on your gethashcode implementation objects with coordinates x y and y x will be considered equals since

9012360
equals	gethashcode
gethashcode can return same value for two cartesiancoordinates that are not equals for two objects c1 and c2 such that and

9012365
chunked	transfer-encoding
you should try using curl instead to test out transfer-encoding chunked

9012370
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode contract says that two objects with the same tracked properties should generate the same hashcode not that two objects with equals hashcodes will be equals

9012381
equals	gethashcode
in your particular case it should also be noted that your gethashcode method doesn t even match your equals method because your gethashcode will return different hash codes for strings that are equals except for case while your equals will return true in that case

9012383
post	get
you should check both get and post

9012511
punctuation	words
tokens are usually words punctuation numbers etc

9012526
mouseover	mouseout
i would recommend mouseover mouseout

9012535

9012667

place4 place5 i may should handle errors there cause there is malloc so i should probably put all the line with place4 to if and if the malloc fails i should put at place 5 free player

9012671
google-chrome	firefox
2.0 now runs across mobile environments and desktop browsers including google-chrome firefox and internet explorer highly customizable and

9012675
for-loop	loops
changing loops variable in a for-loop is bad practice for the reasons described by greg

9012688
int	chars
not sure i can supply more for you other than the concept of casting from chars to int doesn t exist in the language specification

9012688
int	chars
if i treat a chars like an int indexing through it in memory at a low level wouldn t work

9012688
int	chars
a step of 4 bytes treating like int would actually step 2 indices in a chars

9012690
int	chars
the types int and chars are not compatible

9012692
nspersistentdocument	nsdocument
i built my application based on nsdocument - well actually nspersistentdocument as it gives access to core data services for storing my object graph

9012710
typedef	struct
you re creating a typedef called player_struct which is just an alias for struct player

9012714
int	chars
then why i can t assign a chars to int

9012714
int	chars
it is not equivalent to a loop that assigns the values of chars elements to int .

9012716
versioning	upgrade
that is actually an older versioning 1.4 and an upgrade to 1.7 would not work

9012718
typedef	struct
player_struct is a typedef for struct player

9012718
typedef	struct
you don t need struct because of the typedef - same as above

9012721
hide	show
i have two ul s that when the top li is clicked it show the others below and hide another opened in other ul s

9012721
put	get
i have put another a tag beside the main li s but now i cant get the show feature too work

9012726
int	chars
the chars to int promotion is a special provision for primitive types

9012726
int	chars
this works only if a is a reference type. even though chars can be assigned to int this rule doesn t apply because it doesn t apply to primitive types

9012743
punctuation	words
token can be words or punctuation

9012752
getter	setter
now this could be done using standard getter and setter such as vec2 xy and void xy vec2 val

answer number 1 - with the exception of apple s own container controllers notably uitabbarcontroller uinavigationcontroller uisplitviewcontroller uipageviewcontroller and uipopovercontroller did i miss any

9012920
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
malloc calloc and realloc all return which can be assigned to any object pointer type without need for a cast 1

9012920
typedef	struct
also it s not clear what you re trying to accomplish with your typedef and struct definitions

9012920
typedef	struct
you re creating a typedef name value which is a synonym for an as-yet-undefined type struct value_t

9012920
typedef	struct
this value type is different from the struct value type you create later typedef names and struct tags live in different namespaces

9012935

9013082
button	checkbox
instead of using a dropdown menu or checkbox i would like to display the data on button similar to quirky.com s application form- specifically the choose a category field

9013085
pull	push
then i did a pull which as far as i know is a fetch followed by a merge then a push and it worked kinda

9013120
mouseover	mouseout
or do i use mouseout and mouseover events instead of just hover

9013144
fast-forward	merge
pull will do a git fetch and then a git merge which may or may not result in an actual merge git will do a fast-forward by default if at all possible

9013152
fast-forward	merge
pushing is only possible if the pushed branch can be merge on the pushed onto branch using a fast-forward merge meaning that the current head of the remote branch must be part of your local branches history

9013152
pull	push
so if you work on a branch alone and only from one location you can typically get away with simply commiting and pushing otherwise you might need to use git fetch followed by git merge or simply git pull to get the most recent version of the remote branch into your own before you can push it

9013162
hide	show
the only setting i can find that affects the navigation bar is to hide show located in tools options text editor your language general at the bottom under the display heading navigation bar check box

9013184
freetype	libpng
the freetype libs python-gtk python-tk libpng

9013192
jcomponent	bufferedimage
instead draw to a bufferedimage and have the jpanel or jcomponent draw the bufferedimage in its paintcomponent override or add your image data to a collection of some sort and have the paintcomponent override method iterate through the collection using the information to draw your images

9013192
japplet	jcomponent
don t draw directly in a top level window such as a jframe or japplet but instead in a component that derives from jcomponent often either jcomponent itself or jpanel

9013203
pull	push
and you found the solution you had to pull fetch and merge the upstream change into your branch from the bitbucket repo before git would allow you to push your changes

9013243

kde	gnome
i saw that svn now offers an alternative for gnome and kde users where the password is stored in a keyring but many of our unix users don t use either desktop environment

9013427
kde	gnome
in mac gnome and kde it uses a keyring to encrypt and store them

9013427
kde	gnome
as we don t use gnome or kde this makes management very uncomfortable

folder	directory
zendlibrary is a folder in the same directory where my script is

9013632

after experimenting a bit i found a solution that works on safari and google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox

9014428
margin	height
after doing so the image was still affecting the height of the li so i just added an id to the affected li and overwrote the margin-bottom so the sum of its height + bottom margin would equal the sum from the li without the 32px image

a while ago we recognized the need to standardize and currently are almost at a point of ripping out all that dcom baggage and replacing it with a fully compliant rtp rtsp client server framework

9014617
rtp	rtsp
one thing we noticed during testing over the last few months is that when we switch the client to use rtp rtsp there s a noticeable increase in start-up latency

9014617
rtp	rtsp
however my team fully controls our entire rtp rtsp stack and i ve been thinking we could introduce a new rtsp command without touching any of existing commands so we are still fully inter-operable as a solution describe_setup_play

you just show the image before you make the call and hide it in the callback function for the ajax request

9014901
hide	show
you can also use global ajax events in jquery to always show a loading image when an ajax request is sent and hide it when the request is done

9014915

int	chars	int	boolean
in c obj-c the boolean and chars types are treated as int types which is not the case in call languages

9014980
int	boolean
are defined to return the int yes none of the boolean not even _bool value 0 if the relation is false and the int value 1 if the relation is true

9014980

it may be surprising but the whole statement is evaluated without any use of boolean at all - it is all done with int

9014980
int	boolean
- which also doesn t use any boolean is defined in terms of int

9015094
nhibernate	massive
there are great tools out there which can effortlessly move data between a set of pocos and the database nhibernate ef simple data massive dapper etc so in that retrospectiv i would say that you would probably end up with a set of entities in most solutions today the real difference being whether this is just a database model or a real domain model

9015135
typedef	struct
the typedef eliminates the typing of struct when you use it but not when you define it there is no way to eliminate that

9015135
typedef	struct
with a typedef then declaring an instance of the struct becomes

9015135

typedef	struct
note that i used the same identifier for the struct tag and for the typedef

9015244
typedef	struct
on the other hand my own preference is to omit the typedef altogether and just refer to the type as struct structa

9015244
typedef	struct
to summarize the typedef is necessary only if you want to have a one-word name for the type which isn t really required -- and if you do use a typedef there s no real reason to use different identifiers for the typedef and the struct tag

9015246
implements	extends
our customers that use our lab software have to be extra cautious of another user taking control of their computer so we can t implements persistent timeouts i think the last time i read you can keep extends the timeout as long as there s something happening in asp.net right

9015707
cvs	svn
you should use a scm system like cvs svn git or something else

9015707
ant	maven
build with ant or maven but this will be much more expensive solution

9015761
getter	setter
since you cannot override any public getter or setter you can t detect when anyone using your class is writing to these variables

9015761
getter	setter
then change your getter and setter for x y from super. x y to mypointinstance. x y

9015801
objectoutputstream	printwriter
the three methods you mention printwriter objectoutputstream and httpconnection will all result in something being sent to the server but what is actually sent will differ greatly between the various methods

9015815
decimal	ieee
if you re doing financial math you may or may not be better off using a library that does decimal math rather than ieee floating point something akin to java s bigdecimal class or c# s decimal type

9015817
stdout	stderr
i m experiencing some odd behavior when attempting to pinvoke setstdhandle to redirect stdout stderr from an unmanaged dll

9015817
stdout	stderr
where fxnfromunmanageddll outputs to stdout stderr via fprintf the output gets redirected to file only when the project is built as debug. if it s built as release the output goes straight to the visual studio output panel

9015824
width	height
the problem with preview and i assume also pdfkit behind it is that when you set the rotation to 90 it does not simply set the rotate attribute to 90 but it switches the page width and height and applies a transformation on the page content stream so that the page content appears rotated

9015839
g++	gcc
you really should compile with gcc -wall for c code or g++ -wall for c++ code and then you get warnings

9015854
uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller
maybe you confused uipageviewcontroller with uipagecontrol

9015857
tabcontrol	tabitem
the screen has a tabcontrol so many controls are hidden now-showing until you open that tabitem

9015895
folder	directory
the most common thing is to read properties files from the classpath or from the working directory in the first case you should create the file in the root of the source folder

9015895
jar	war
in the second case you can create the file directly in the project node but in this case the file won t be added to the final jar war if you want to distribute your program

9015911
width	height
in order to always get this size i first resize them to fit the max width or height depending on image orientation and then crop in the center

i ve also found out that it only exits when the x and y arguments to putpixel are bigger than the original width and height of the surface but haven t i resized the surface using sdl_creatergbsurface to the required width and height

9016140
width	height
you need to set the paper size in report properties to custom and specify width and height explicitly according to your layout

9016396
oncreate	setcontentview
the trick is to add the setcontentview in the onbuildheaders section but not in the oncreate

9016439
dlsym	dlopen

9016614
sorting	grouping
sorting via the details properties window will override the tablix sort order for sorting within grouping

9016677
children	parent
and if a child is active then the parent should be active too and automaticly show the children

9016677

i can only get the standard links to do so and if you click a parent who s not active the parent who is active should slide up the children and become deactivated

9016734
portrait	landscape
the first two are in portrait orientation and the last two are in landscape

9016750
superclass	subclassing
in a class hierarchy when a function method in a subclassing has the same name and type signature as a method in its superclass then the method in the subclassing is said to override the method in the superclass

9016801
int	chars
when that result is stored back into variable it s converted from int to chars

9016801
int	chars
another rather obscure possibility is that chars and int could be the same size which can happen only if chars is at least 16 bits

9016829
multiplying	modulo
we divide degrees by 360 and multiplying by 40 to get the correct image given a specified degree we then use the modulo to keep the image_direction in the range 0-39 for degrees +360 or -360 and finally if the degree was a negative one image_direction will turn out to be negative therefore adding 40 to it will correct the image_direction

9016829
subtract	add
edit oh sorry i seemed to have missed the part about a degree of 90 image index of 0 easy enough to add in here just subtract 90 from the actual degree code edited above

9016868
textmate	sublimetext
i ve added textmate to the tags as sublimetext is compatible with text mate plugins

can u tell me how to iterate each row of temptable using while loops or for-loop in sql

9016961
superclass	subclassing
the aggregateservice is intended to be what isolates your subclassing from changes in the superclass and enable changes in the superclass without breaking subclassing

9016961
superclass	subclassing
if you go for option 1 you couple the subclassing to your superclass thus loosing the intended isolation

9016961
superclass	subclassing
taking an explicit dependency on iservicea in the subclassing that class can live on happily ignorant about changes going on in the superclass internals

9017023

path mtu is supposed to be automatically discovered but if an intervening router is dropping all icmp traffic including needs fragmentation then you may see hanging connections

9017147
min	max
problem is i don t know the numbers beforehand so i don t know the max and min value

9017147
min	max
in other words the max and min numbers are different each time the user enters different values to the equations

9017147
min	max
a is the min value and b is the max value

9017147
min	max
one of the numbers a b c d e can be the max value and another can be min value

9017147
min	max
so basically i need to compare these numbers find which one is the max and which one is the min and add them to the aforementioned formula for normalization

is there a major difference between objectcontext dbcontext or they are mainly the same and offer that same capabilities

9020809

is there a way i can get the buttons to all be the same size and all maintain the same width to height 4 3 ratio

9021144
width	height
how can i get the width of the buttons to be the same size while maintaining a 4 3 width to height ratio

9021144
width	height
the width to height ratio constraint is so i don t end up with really tall and thin buttons which would look silly

9021144
width	height
if i could find a way to incrementally increase the width or height whichever is smaller of the button and then resize it so it re- wraps_content then this could work

9021177
portrait	landscape
i think the problem here is that because your page is landscape it actually gets created first by silverlight as portrait and then rotated around - leaving your uielementrenderer with the wrong size and everything looking wrong

9021179
ddms	adb
i ve tried restarting adb stop start adb restart ddms restart emulator recreate avd

so for now i just inline javascript just after the html code of the tag that has to be changed but is there a way to do this without inlining js after every such tag

9021556
width	height
it respects both width and height while widht 100 or height 100 works unless the window width height is not smaller then image itself

9021564
domcontentloaded	onload
the onload handler is not exactely equal to the domcontentloaded handler but it has a better support and may be preferred here

9021573
int	chars
ive tried setting the database table field in vchar chars int date datetime and time just nothing

9021585
google-chrome	safari
it runs on webkit what safari and google-chrome use so it supports tons of css properties

9021587
put	get
so the problem is if i put template code meant for the client inside a template it still get s parsed on the server side

9021594
put	get	width	height
if you are able to get the same height for all you can use android layout_weight 1 for all buttons and put android layout_width 0dip so all buttons will have same width

9021598
submit	submission
i need to be able to hit submit on the parent page and as well as submission the parents form fields but also the iframes form fields all to the same php script

9021608
for-loop	loops
one way i was thinking to solve this was to count the number of lines at the first iteration of loops and then check it at the end of each iteration against what it thinks the value should be and if it is more than it expects then go back to above the for-loop using a goto or some such but gotos don t work in logic expressions

9021624

9021889
vb.net	vb6
vb6 was interpreted vb.net is almost compiled

your converter is currently returning a boolean to indicate whether or not it could parse an int from the string value

9022060

an alternative is to just do the job in the listener method of instead of in the getter setter doing business job in getter setter is a poor practice anyway

9022383
folder	directory
if i can t do that how can i have a script duplicate all folder without contents in directory a to directory b

9022387
folder	directory
i d like the script to basically check if these if files or folder exist in a few different directory and if they do redirect to it

9022435
lxml	beautifulsoup
if that s the case you should not use a regular expression but parse the html with lxml beautifulsoup or another html parser

9022440
put	get
the nearest you can get to that behaviour is to put as near as you can to the very start of the first stylesheet on your html page rather than applying directly to the style property of the element where it will have a very high specificity

9022480
post	get
first i ve run the following statement to get the right post code

9022494
for-loop	arrays
or you could use an arrays and find the entry with std find_if or a simple for-loop if your library doesn t have that yet or std binary_search if you make sure the arrays is sorted

9022505
hide	show
i have some filters that the users can click to hide show the markers on the map

9022505
hide	show
the problem i m having is that when i hide several markers they all disappear at once but when i show the icons they show up slowly it takes a couple of seconds for 40 markers to become visible

9022507
folder	directory
ideally this would create a random folder each time the script is run under my web directory sample_folder

9022570
rank	percentile
here is my take using percentile rank which only assumes a univariate series of measurement is available your column headed x

9022570
rank	percentile
in r i would simply use a function like trunc rank x length x to get the percentile ranks.

9022605
post	get
i will post in a new question if i don t get a response

9022613
pop-up	dialog
then your auth-cookie will expire and use js to pop-up the login dialog a few min before the auth cookie expired to avoid the gap where the user will land on login page if they click on a link if you care about that even

9022644
tiff	png
the purpose - to save each tiff s page as png and store it as byte s array

9022664
hash-collision	key
hash tables must allow for hash-collision even if two key have same hash value the implementation of the table must have a strategy to insert and retrieve the key and value pairs unambiguously

9022664
cpython	pypy
if the slot is occupied cpython and even pypy compares the the hash and the key by compare i mean comparison not the is comparison of the entry in the slot against the key of the current entry to be inserted dictobject.c 337 344-345

9022666

specifying equals gethashcode in the interface does not work

9022673
folder	directory
have you checked the filesystem permissions for the folder under which you are trying to create the directory

9022685
folder	directory
to write directory into that folder your script will need write access

9022715
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works with google-chrome 16 in a logical and expected way and it completely bug with firefox 8

9022760
turing	decidable
i m inclined to think that this is decidable given the fact that when fed into a turing machine it will never reach an accept state and loop for infinity unless it rejects

9022811
implements	extends
mylist implements imylist extends list myitem

9022811
implements	extends
myotherlist implements imylist extends observablecollection myitem

9022833
children	parent
this means that if a parent is deleted it s children cannot exist

9022835
hash-collision	key
hash tables must allow for hash-collision even if two distinct key have the same hash value the table s implementation must have a strategy to insert and retrieve the key and value pairs unambiguously

9022835
cpython	pypy
if the slot is occupied cpython and even pypy compares the hash and the key by compare i mean comparison not the is comparison of the entry in the slot against the hash and key of the current entry to be inserted dictobject.c 337 344-345 respectively

9022851
gcov	lcov
the reason i need -a is when i use lcov it gives that option to gcov i can hack geninfo to ignore that option but i prefer not to since i ll eventually run lcov on a public system

9022887
equals	gethashcode
most hashtables require two bits of support from your storage objects - gethashcode and equals

9022887
equals	gethashcode
if two objects return the same gethashcode but their comparison with equals returns true they represent the same data and thus is not a collision just duplicate entries

9022887
equals	gethashcode
this is why in many oop languages like c# you have to overrride implement gethashcode and equals in your storage objects

9022887
equals	gethashcode
if you ever implement those methods such that two objects when compared with equals returns true but return different values from gethashcode then you have a bug

9022914
ant	maven
comparing maven with ivy ant is to compare a smartphone to telegraphy

9022914
ant	maven
in the past i wrote many ant scripts and with upcoming maven i began to hate ant

9022914
ant	maven
another advice should be mentioned ant offers the integration of maven

9022914
ant	maven
this integration is often used to test and play with maven in projects that are grown up with ant

9022914
ant	maven
instead stay with ant and its pain or migrate fully to maven

9022924
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested in google-chrome safari with no success

9022925
textview	listactivity
from the tutorials i have seen android either displays a listview using listactivity with separate xml which would not display the textview and the button or using activity with main.axml which would not let me populate the listview with something like this

9022927

currently only firefox and google-chrome fully support web sockets according to caniuse

9022968
mouseover	mouseenter
use mouseenter instead of mouseover

9022987
hide	show
this code essentially loops through the spans and sends it to a cycle function which will hide the current span and show the next one

9023004
hide	show
the purpose of the code is to eval the value of #rfq_need_report and show the #rfq_report_language if need_report is true or hide if false

9023020
put	get
so you can put it in the string directly and get an exact measurement like this

so i recommend not to use marshal.allochglobal malloc marshal.freehglobal and free crosswise

9026550

multiplying	subtract
for the next seed we got 59694 now there is a kind of a shortcut that you can also use once a full seed has been calculated or the shortcut itself could be used which is you take the last digit multiplying it by 2 and subtract the first digit doubling one digit is easily done in the head the important thing is to remember all the other digits and their order in the sequence this will at best though only produce pseudo - random numbers with some long repeat times the larger the list of numbers that you use but the initial list must be chosen with care like for instance don t pick all zeroes as you list or you will have an endless stream of zeroes and well some sets of digits will produce longer repeat cycles than others but maybe this should be done on paper provided you have a pencil or pen and a sheet of paper handy.

i ve seen audio architectures that are push and pull based and both have pro s and cons

9032263
ready	each
in a push based system where each filter pushes data downstream to a down stream filter you need some notion of timing the push requests such that you have data at the end of your chain of audio processing units when the sound card is ready for data

9032263
pull	push
i would recommend not doing a pull push based system but an executor style architecture

9032267
hide	show
change to and switch the show and hide texts

9032324
getter	setter

of course you also need to consider the rtp traffic which is what will carry the audio part of the call once sip has set it up

9033162
voip	rtp
there are no standardised ports for rtp but some popular voip softswitches do use certain ranges by default

9033162
voip	sip
still it s likely to need a sophisticated entity monitoring your traffic to detect a voip call using sip over tls on a non-standard port and srtp call amongst the general noise of internet traffic

9033180
width	margin
remove the margin 0 auto from the nav there s no need for it as the width is 100 and you want to center the ul

9033677
rss	feed
now everything is done and when i generate the content by php coding and when i try to extract the things from title and content tags the output is not generated...when i cross checked i found the php generated file source code rss feed looks like

9033923
portrait	landscape
i have two views one of them is in landscape and other in portrait

9033923

if you have 1 screens switching off all but the main screens this should resolve the problem

9033943
puts	gets
if then it puts it on the map but if the second word is one again instead of fetching frequency 1 it gets null again

9033965
getter	setter
normally to realized linked objects i usually use getter and setter methods and this way i add objects of different type to another object

9034008

it has a ton of extensions that go above and beyond normal jax-b one of which will allow you to ignore inherited properties etc

9034527
width	height
so in this case i start out with the default height and width for my view as the values for the metrics dictionary keys viewwidth and viewheight

9034527

beneath is the final code that works in google-chrome + ie + firefox

9034609

compute the maprect s origin width and height manually while trying to be fancy and not worry about the correct ordering of the corners

9034652

csv handling functions fgetcsv fputcsv are much better for this - they will handle edge cases and will likely be far more reliable than any regex you can come up with

9034659
int	chars
for int it would be 0 for chars it would be 0 etc

9034674
datediff	difference
i am experiencing a rather strange problem using php 5.3 s datediff function to calculate the difference in days between two dates

9034828
google-chrome	firefox

9034918
g++	gcc

9034951
range	min
try using math.random the size of your range + min

it s because the subclassing has visibility of private for the void func method but the superclass has visibility public

9035107

assuming you re using the jquery validate plugin you ll need to modify it to bind to only the submit button form submission

9035119

if the overridden or hidden method is protected then the overriding or hiding method must be protected or public

9035119
superclass	subclassing

9035122
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari	webkit	blink
ie since version 5.5 i think and webkit blink browsers google-chrome safari and opera version from the last couple of years for example support a selectionchange event on the document which does exactly what you want

9035122
opera	firefox	mouse	keyboard
firefox and pre-blink opera have no such event and all you can do is detect selection changes made via keyboard and mouse events which is unsatisfactory there is no way of detecting select all from context or edit menus for example or simply poll the selection object returned by window.getselection checking the selection s anchornode anchoroffset focusnode and focusoffset properties against their previous values should be sufficient

9035138
inherited	properties
inherited from the parent element properties

9035203

you don t need to set height width for buttons they will be set relatively

9038874

anyway i checked your code ..your mistake that you always calculate knopafmeting based on width that is correct if height is equal or greater than width

9038881
slideup	slidedown
or alternatively you can use the slideup slidedown functions that do this already

i was wondering if there s any way on android to under certain circumstances like if i m on a kindle force it to load from the hdpi artwork instead of defaulting to mdpi

9038987
mdpi	hdpi
i do realize that i could just save my hdpi artwork in the mdpi folder with a slightly different name and do a check for every resource but that s a lot of overhead not to mention an increase in the size of my app which i d also like to avoid

9038987
mdpi	hdpi
i guess what i m really getting at is there a way for an android device to chose hdpi artwork instead of mdpi even though the mdpi artwork exists

9039033

similarly if i drag the card from position 3 and dropped it in position 9 then card in position 3 should move to 9 card in postion 4 should move to position 3 card in postion 5 should move to position 4 card in postion 6 should move to position 5 card in postion 7 should move to position 6 card in postion 8 should move to position 7 and card in postion 9 should move to position 8

since you re passing an int in place of a double printf is trying to get 8 bytes off the stack instead of four and it s trying to interpret the bytes of a int as the bytes of a double

couldn t there be potential problems if a user sends input to a mouse event or a keyboard event before the whole page has been rendered

9042520
getter	setter
and then define its getter setter or synthesize it in the .m file

9042520
getter	setter
if the property is not declared but a getter setter synthesize exists the compiler will let you use it from inside the class implementation from the point it was defined down the file

9042739
maven	pom.xml
i don t know the exact reason but it looks like properties-maven-plugin can substitute the property value properly defined under properties tag in pom.xml and maven can only recognize the properties name explicitly defined in pom.xml the following pom.xml works for me

9042739
maven	pom.xml
from my point of view the predefined build lifecycle of maven is quite exclusive especially when integrating with other build tools like adt the pom.xml version used for generating the apk is quite restricted moreover from the plugin documentation current version of android-maven-plugin does not provide any configuration for customizing the final apk name during apk goal

9042739
android-maven-plugin	zipalign

accessor	properties
this specifies that the accessor methods for firstname lastname and age should be synthesized and that the properties age is represented by the instance variable yearsold

9042844
getter	setter
this is saying that the display getter and setter provide access to the _display member variable

but i think an unsigned integer is allowed to take the zero value isn t it

9044059
integer	unsigned
does somebody can explain me the mechanism behind that reverse loop with an unsigned integer

int	double
the int types in java don t have representations of infinity not a number values etc - whereas ieee-754 floating point types such as float and double do

9044130
int	double
also bear in mind that the cases in which int or decimal floating point types are used typically don t need to concept of infinity or not a number results - whereas in scientific applications where float double are more typically useful infinity or at least a number which is too large to sensibly represent is still a potentially valid result

9045328
post	get
what is the best way to make a post to another aspx page to get values

9045333
crypt	salt
crypt is a one-way function and returns a string that already contains the salt

9045333
crypt	salt
when comparing the user input with the crypt result the function automatically extracts the salt from the string

9045333
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
crypt outputs a string that contains both the salt and the result of the hash

9045333
hash	salt
when you pass it that string as a salt it knows to extract only the salt part and ignore the hash part

9045333
hash	salt
and it still returns a string containing both the salt and the hash

9045333
crypt	salt
when you pass this output as salt back to crypt it will extract the right algorithm and salt and use these for the operation

9045333
hash	salt
the hash part in the passed salt parameter is ignored

9045357
clang	llvm
i m not sure for llvm clang there are ones but i don t remember them right now but for gcc you should use the macro __gnuc__ which will be defined by the compiler itself without you having to worry about it

9045385
persian	farsi
the farsi language persian iso 639-1 2-letter code fa is not recognized by default

9045448
integer	unsigned
the bit pattern 0xffffffff happens to look like -1 when interpreted as a 32b signed integer and as 4294967295 when interpreted as a 32b unsigned integer

9045464
integer	unsigned
this can be also a caveat because when comparing signed and unsigned integer one of them will be implicitly casted to match the types

9045502
division	multiplication
i ve also taken the liberty to replace division by two with multiplication by 0.5f because the arm processors do not have a division instructions therefore the divisions are executed by software and rewritten as multiplication anyway

9045510
fadein	fadeout
do you realize that the code inside the fadeout callback the shuffle and fadein function calls is getting run once per every .list li element

9045531
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
that accepts either nothing a salt or a hash that crypt made earlier which has the salt to make the hash embedded in it

9045531
hash	salt
in the latter case the salt is used and not the entire hash

9045585

maven	pom.xml
apparently maven does not make any variable property substitution when installing the pom.xml

9045751
maven	pom.xml
you d better not read any properties from pom.xml unless this is version number bout you should configure your properties in external file one per stage dev.properties test.properties ... and then configure maven profiles again one per stage and invoke maven like mvn -pdev depending on what you want to build

9045751

9046028
post	get
is it possible for me to get paypal post variables in return url

9046034
width	margin
i would suggest explicitly setting the widths of every object that usually fixes the problem under ie6 please remember that the outer width of the object is width + margin + padding so when you calculate the desired width take that into consideration

9046052
opera	google-chrome
i tested in opera 11 and google-chrome

9046074
pull	push
i can now pull push from this extension

9046086
width	margin
alternatively you can keep width 100 but then you ll need to remove the default margin on body

9046101
width	height
the problem is that you cannot simple use the width and height of the drawable to calculate the rectangle s position as it might get resized to fit the imageview

9046101
width	height
coordinates of the rectangle are from the upper left corner counter wise 0 0 width imageview 0 width imageview height imageview 0 height imageview

9046101
width	height
when the ratios don t match and let s say for example the drawable is wider than the imageview then the drawable will fill the complete width of the imageview but will not fill the height

9046101
width	height
so the coordinates of the rectangle are from the upper left corner counter wise 0 y width imageview y width imageview y + current height drawable 0 y + current height drawable

9046101
width	height
if the drawable is higher than the imageview then you can calculate it the same way but have to exchange the width and height values

9046116
width	height
i then compute a vector from anchor to target that points to one of the four corners it always does even when on an axis allowing me to expand shrink the width height of the view at the same time as moving or not its origin giving the effect that you can resize the top and left origin change required as well as the width height only origin left alone or a combination of both

9046116
width	height
in other words the vector is used to determine which corner i am pointing to and thus which quadrant the touch operates in thus allowing me to chose which of x y width or height to alter and the target current previous position tell me by how much

9046116

width	height
using frame buffer objects for rendering on ios which appears to be apples preferred way of rendering on ios according to the opengl es programming guide for ios from apple one is supposed to use glrenderbufferstorage for specifying properties like width and height according to opengl es 2.0 programming guide from munshi ginsburg and shreiner

9047023
width	height
apple then goes on writing to fetch width and height from the renderbuffer as that buffer sets them on creation without further detail

9047023

background-color	transparency
if i understand correctly then it would be easier if you gave your image a transparency background and set the background container s background-color property without having to use filters and so on

9047174
vbo	normals
for such simple objects i would make one big vbo say 200 objects nrverticespercube put all the data interleaved vertex normals uv vertex normals uv etc

9047174
vbo	normals
this creates my vbo buffer with the correct size in this case 8 sizeof glfloat wich is 3 verts 3 normals and 2uv and copies the first keyframe to the buffer you could do the same with you initial object positions or just leave that and compute latter.

9047194

put	get
here is what i put to get it working

9047258
udp	tcp
tcp uses data streams and udp uses data blocks

9047258
udp	tcp
the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

9047315
udp	tcp
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

9047349
put	get
now when i run this and input the dummy names i put into a google doc spreadsheet to test as soon as i hit shift+ctl+v without hitting enter i get this

you couldget the effect you want by removing the height and width bindings and leaving them as automatic

9047505
firefox	safari
the code runs just fine in the latest firefox ie9 and safari though no sound at all on ios4 iphone ipad but apparently that s a commercial decision by apple

i have a spinner which gets populate using a simplecursoradapter

9048095
min	max
i am trying generate a random number that is within an annulus we have a max and min radius

9048097
for-loop	loops
i say it is potential because the for-loop has already buffered the queue so it doesn t care - unless you abort loops because new work has been appended to the late.txt file - then you actually will skip those missing ids

9048147
hash	md5
for example you can store a hash code like md5 or sha1 of the password in a second cookie and then check if that hash corresponds to the user that the client pretends to be

9048163
hash	salt
bcrypt uses a modified encryption algorithm along with a salt which makes it expensive to calculate a single hash by using something called a work factor

9048166
children	parent
is there any way in eclipse cdt to locate the pure virtual functions of the parent class and auto complete the declaration of the children class just like in the java development

9048175

try spinner#setselection int position boolean animate with animate false

9048189
width	height
i can reduce the width of the selected item but i haven t found a way to reduce the height

9048235

9048472
google-chrome	safari
edit i should point out that the code works fine on google-chrome and safari

9048519
stdout	stderr
the problem is that the process you are trying to execute may depending on lot of things either first write to stdout or stderr

9048519
stdout	stderr
to handle this properly always you must create 2 threads to read stderr and stdout simulteneously

9048533
ssl	https
i m building an application that needs to open self-signed https ssl

9048533
keystore	jks
all you have to do is import the certificate in a keystore jks or pkcs12 and load it in your custom trustmanagers in your application

9048543
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
firefox allows a require directive but opera and google-chrome do not and local file security issues come into play with loading any local files

9048543
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
preferably for a userscript this would be a combination that works in opera firefox and google-chrome

9048594
pem	pkcs#12	pkcs#12	pfx
you need openssl the cygwin version works on windows to convert the pfx pkcs#12 file to a pem file then you can create a certificate from the pem

9048594
keystore	jks
finally you can use the java keytool program to convert the certificate to jks format the keystore default

9048594
keystore	jks
now you should be able to load the jks file with the keystore instance in your code

9048633
width	height
it s better to first cache the original file and then like explained by nick lockwood resize them remember retina displays need twice the width height for hi-res displaying

9048637
sorting	filtering
you will be still able to use local paging sorting and filtering searching of the data

9048638
alarmmanager	wakelock
i solved the problem by removing wakelock waste of battery doing a 10-second busy wait thread sleep just in case one blocks the gps invocation of onloc and using alarmmanager to wake the device from sleep and start the service

9048656
firefox	safari
the problem is that some browsers firefox safari on mac first time display menu incorrect like this

9048673
range	max
then assuming you name this named range ratio_data your function could be referring to max ratio_data in combination with index-match as suggested by tim mayes

9048691
width	height
give the frame a width and height

9048703
apache	lighttpd
it doesn t sound like suexec is in use so fastcgi will most likely run as the same user the web server is running as apache nobody daemon lighttpd etc

9048703
apache	lighttpd
are you using apache lighttpd or something else

9048707
width	height
i am working on a small game project and i have created an image that is 25 x 35 width height

uicontrol which is the superclass of uibutton passes itself as the only parameter to its target using the action selector

9048850
folder	directory
when i open the project in eclipse make any changes and save the project eclipse automatically copies the .svn folder from my java directory to my classes folder

9048856
int	chars
the result of the conversion of the negative signed chars value -1 will be a huge unsigned int value equal to uint_max

9048856
int	chars
y is of signed chars type so it is first promoted to int after int promotions and x is of unsigned int type and stays an unsigned int

9048856
integer	unsigned
usual arithmetic conversions suite c99 6.3.1.8p1 otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type.

9048856
int	chars
unsigned int has the same conversion rank as the int type remember signed chars was promoted to int so the promoted y will be converted from int after promotion to unsigned int

9048856
int	chars
now how is an int value of -1 the signed chars -1 after its promotion to int converted to an unsigned int value

9048856
integer	unsigned
integer conversions c99 6.3.1.3p2 otherwise if the new type is unsigned the value is converted by repeatedly adding or subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type until the value is in the range of the new type.

9048863
int	chars
in this case signed chars y will have been converted into the unsigned int with value uint_max

9048891
put	get
when i use the sbt plugin gen-idea it seems to download all the necessary dependencies which get put into my .ivy directory as expected

9048895
django	web.py
i use django for web development and i don t about how web.py works but i think you can store it in session context or as a cookie if that variable is per-site-visitor based

9048917
ord	chr
you can replace the list comprehension with a map chr range ord a ord z +1 call but that s perhaps not what you re really asking

9048932
decimal	ieee
the ieee 754 standard requires that a binary - char - binary roundtrip recovers the original value if the character representation contains 36 significant decimal digits

the other compilers are the same on both platforms as are other .net languages like nemerle boo and phalanger php

9049030
int	chars
number of bytes number of chars since the c standard reuires that chars be an 1-byte int

9049075
stdout	stderr
if you do plan to run your program directly from the shell like this be sure that any error messages are written to stderr instead of stdout

9049084
gif	png
you can check if uploaded file has konwn image format extension jpg gif png etc and if so then save to your content gallery folder otherwise save to your content files folder

9049087
mouse	keyboard
i m making a little application that needs to know how long the user has been idle â as in not using a keyboard or a mouse

9049087
xlib	xcb
both xcb and xlib promise to give me idle time through their respective screensaver extensions

9049099
qgraphicsitem	qvector
i figure i can loop through each dimension create the qvector for the outer loop then cloning the qgraphicsitem on the inner loop unless it s possible to just simply clone the base qvector and inherently clone everything inside - currently everything inside are pointers

9049099
qgraphicsitem	qvector
each qgraphicsitem has get set functions to retrieve any properties i need so i could just create a new top level qvector outer loop to create a new qvector for each row then inner loop creating new qgraphicsitems and setting the properties of the original chart

9049107
getter	setter
i skipped the details of timeable base but it has a setter start_date val and a getter start_date and of course many more

9049139
getter	setter
so i have getter and setter methods in the facts model like this

9049150
mouse	keyboard
however contrary to most of the documentation it is mentioned here keyboard and mouse hooks work without a dll

9049191
codeigniter	cakephp

post	get
get will be after loading user edit form post would be after subbmiting it

9049225
svm	cross-validation
thus it only returns the cross-validation accuracy assuming you have a classification problem otherwise mean-squared error for regression as a scalar number instead of an actual svm model

9049225
svm	cross-validation
this shouldn t be hard to implement create a grid of values using meshgrid iterate overall all pairs c gamma training an svm model with say 5-fold cross-validation and choosing the values with the best cv-accuracy.

9049242
folder	directory
and in linker - general you set additional library directory to the output folder of navigator project if you haven t changed it s output directory it is .. debug for debug configuration and .. release and in linker - input you add

9049287
apache	nginx
yes you have to change in the apache settings or nginx settings or the server you are using this will redirect all the requests coming to your old website to your new website

9049297
centos	linux
i am on x86_x64 intel xeon cpu running a centos linux distro kernel

9049298
free	malloc
note that if you use malloc instead of and worry to free the previous array and to initialize teeest it will be correct

9049381
hide	show
the problem is slidedown doesn t animate it s current behaviour is analogous to me calling hide and show it simply appears

9049405
post	get
i have found post explaining how to send an image and how to receive files in mvc but i can t seem to get the two to tie together

9049415
put	get
however one way to get around this would be to put a pass-through property on myusercontrol that just relays its information to the nested controls

9049460
jobs	cron
i m familiar with creating cron jobs in linux

9049512
komodo	aptana
i ve been using komodo edit for the last few years but am once again thinking of switching to aptana because of it s built in refactoring tools for python

9049524
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both have no issues

9049573
next	except
i tried the most obvious thing which is to prefix it with spaces which works except when the text wraps to the next line as shown below

9049579
octal	binary
this concept could be extended to the octal and binary numbering systems

9049582
mousemove	mousedown
now when you mousedown on either sliderrect sliderstartline or sliderendline i hook onto the mousemove event and use it to determine what to set the start time end time and duration variables else where in my javascript

9049670
width	height
the pixel width and height of your page will depend on orientation as well as the meta viewport tag if specified

9049674
for-loop	arrays
you d first have to extract each decimal place s value first either by converting it to a character arrays itoa or by writing a small for-loop that divides the number by powers of 10

9049707
floating-point	integer
when doing a floor although it would be possible to convert the argument to an integer this is not what most languages would do because the original type is a floating-point number

9049709
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie firefox but not google-chrome

9051066
for-loop	arrays
i put it in for readability to make it obvious that you are storing a reference to the object you were looking for then removing it then putting it in at the beginning of the arrays but given that the .splice method returns an arrays of the removed item s you can replace those three lines within the for-loop with this single line

think about your using union and distinct keywords

9053123
union	distinct
rationale both union and distinct apply a unique sort operation on your intermediate result sets

integer	unsigned
note that integer overflows only regard signed integer as unsigned integer never overflow

9053207
integer	unsigned
c99 6.2.5p9 a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type.

9053267
width	margin
also anything floated needs a width and as to the double-margin bug it only occurs when you have margin on the same side as the side the element is floated.....so if you re declaring float right on something you don t want to have margin 0 20px 0 0 on the same thing.

9053294
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
as zmbq mentioned in his comment to marc s question the sortedlist is implemented as an array so if faster insertion removal times are needed then the sorteddictionary would be a better choice

i believe it boils down to the behaviour of the stl allocator used since it is responsible for writing the initial zeros or not

9054230
folder	directory
in java i am trying to list the files and folder in my c directory and loop through them using

9054230

furthermore as you would suspect when you start to use a recursive method to look through every folder on the drive it throws a nullpointerexception as soon as it tries to list the files in that directory

9054233
gmail	hotmail
i am going to have a bunch of these modules 10+ for gmail hotmail etc...

9054248

this will behave slightly different than the other approaches in that it will leave a dangling spaces delimiter at the end

9054257
min	max
it is faster than sort or multiple call of min max for large size inputs

9054299
uiview	subviews
i recommend creating your own uiview subclass which looks like a uialertview and then you can add it and an image or whatever else you want to put in there as a subviews and you won t have unexpected breakage if apple does something to the uialertview class to make its innards even more private

9054553
int	chars
here is the code i have written which splits a string in c and then i want to return the first int value pointed by the chars pointer

9054602
activemq	rabbitmq

9054805
put	get
this is done with typeclasses for each effect on offer for example monadstate provides get and put

9054868
getter	setter
you ll also not want to try to directly access itemtoupdatetipo0 s fields but rather use public getter and possibly setter methods to do this for you

9054883
post	get
i am using lwp useragent to do a simple http post and get the error below

9054906

vendors folder in my apps directory right

9054986
base-class	subclassing
because you would have a lot of subclassing to a base class it s important to take your time and think out how that base-class should work

so far the program seems to work except for the fact that each key needs to be clicked by the mouse before the sound is played by pressing each key hence put the object in focus where i need the key to play the sound without clicking the keyboard key put the object in focus on keydown

9055168
put	get
when i put in a bad email address i don t get a notification that is was not delivered

9055308
int	chars
i read that one can use chars for small int

9055311
hash	md5
in case usually uses md5 hash

9055326
int	double
avoid using double precision and use arbitrary length int instead

9055362
int	chars
operations on unsigned int are typically faster than on unsigned chars because your processor cannot fetch single bytes but has to get at least a multiple of 4 and mask out the other 3 bytes

9055368
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i did a little experimenting and it seems the viewcontrollers view sets its frame correctly somewhere after viewwillappear is called and before viewdidappear is called

9055369

9055403
post	get
first of all i know this type of post are already been made but i ve tried almost all of them and i m not been able to get the results so here i m again posting the same kind of question

9055417
int	chars
a chars is a small int with range -127 to +127 and it is subjected to the same int arithmetic as int are

9055417
int	chars
the problem here is the concept mix-up between the internal representation binary number representing the -127 to +127 range with the external one that conventionally makes the input and output functions to represent it as the glyph whose ascii code is the number carried on by it while for int the external representation is the chars sequence that read like the int represented in decimal form

9055435
std	ostream
there is an overload of for std ostream and signed unsigned char that performs character output

9055435
int	chars
in order to output the int value of the chars you need to perform a cast

9055458
versioning	upgrade
i would also strongly recommend that you upgrade to a more recent versioning of cassandra

9055464
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
yes just for something like reading from a file you have java.io classes for things like file randomaccessfile filereader fileinputstream datainputstream and bufferedreader all slightly different and used for different purposes often one stacked atop another

9055469
width	height
i would like it to only resize the chat text area when the resize is done vertically keeping the controls the same height consistently also i would like the buttons for sending the chat to maintain their size with the input box increasing in width when the size is increased horizontally

9055469
width	height
obviously the swf resizing will be done by javascript jquery .onresize and thus i will be able to set a mimimum width and height for the swf maintaining usability

9055493
cassette	squishit
i have a small article on using squishit with mvc3 though i prefer cassette

9055564
post	put	post	get	put	get

9055566
chunked	transfer-encoding
if you re using chunked transfer encoding which is your case here transfer-encoding chunked you should look for the 0 termination character but you ll also have to analyse all the chunks and glue them together since you don t want to stop when the actual content contains a 0

9055572
pull	push
i was able to push and pull to this repo just fine before reinstalling lion and i still can with the different syntax

but if all you have put into the list are comboitem then the object you get out will be a comboitem

9055634
width	height
you can use screenfly to test your website on the iphone resultion screenfly uses a iframe with a specified width and height

9055653
keystore	jks
the default keystore format for java is jks

9055653
keystore	jks
instead you can support more than the jks and try the default keystore type and if it fails try the #pkcs12

9055706
implements	extends
implements an interface instead of extends a base class or doing both could be another way to let functionthatreceivesanextendedexample call func on ex without caring what exact class the ex object is and without the example class having to implements a func function as in your example

9055727
post	get
please post your implementation of pluginmanager.dowork and the exact error message you get when the test fails

9055788
gcj	javac
it s working fine with javac but with gcj on an up-to-date ubuntu it s not working

9055795
width	height
this means that animating the dimensions requires you to adjust the width and or height incrementally while re-drawing the entire canvas at each iteration

9055795
width	height
if you are looking to animate the canvas dimensions to reveal content that is already present on a larger theoretical canvas the user has a small window that s cropping the full canvas you would be better off playing with your css width and height along with the overflow hidden

9055805
post	get
first of all to the moderators don t get angry if this is not the right place to post this

9055819

you need to make sure that there is a top-level uiview object which is not added as subviews of any other view and that there is a uitableview in the uiview

9055989
uiwebview	nsurlprotocol
see drop-in offline caching for uiwebview and nsurlprotocol

9055989
uiwebview	nsurlprotocol	nsurlconnection	nsurlprotocol
the short answer in my experience is that the easiest solution is to use an nsurlprotocol to intercept nsurlconnection requests including the ones made by uiwebview and write the results to disk

9055989
nsurlcache	uiwebview
for more information on how to subclass nsurlcache see substituting local data for remote uiwebview requests on cocoa with love and afcache .

9055992
next	except
you can do certainly do it except when you are pointing at the last element of the list in this case next would return null and you would see bad access as the result

9056009
put	get
an restful api exists for the attachments providing get put delete operations implementing crud operations on the server side

9056027

9056345
width	height
let h screen height w screen width f fraction of screen dimension x image size

9056392
put	get
however if you cannot do that for some reasons then i would suggest to make it an xml file and then you can get variables from simplexml and such you can view all and put their values to a form

9056439
children	parent
if that were the only style being applied to both of these elements it would make sense to set the style on a parent higher up so that it gets inherited by all its children grandchildren and so on

9056503
width	height
you can use some code like this you can adjust a height and width as per your need

9056509
width	height
just as an aside - in your pasted code you ve mixed up the variable names you declare them as height and width but pass them as _width and _height

9056565
children	parent
it uses the html as you provided with one minor change i moved the ul that houses the children selects inside of the li that houses the parent

9056811
post	get
you are sending the form via get but test for the post parameter

9056846
post	get
also i think you should be using a get request instead of post for curl

9056866
free	malloc
that is if you are going to need memory during run-time and do not want to declare it during compile time you will need to use malloc and free when you ve finished with the memory

the problem is that you are trying to instantiate a nsmanagedobject using a conventional alloc init method of nsobject

9057148
opencart	magento
a pretty long wish list i know but i expect a combination of modx with something as powerful as magento xtcommerce opencart or the likes would be a really nice way to realize a big website with integrated shop

9057157
entities	entitymanager
moving both entities into the same entitymanager resolves the issue

9057183
udp	tcp
this may let you change protocols as well and may change how the device is configured - the difference between streaming udp with no retransmission of lost packets and tcp where the sender may need to be able to retransmit may be significant

voip	rtp
and now that i ve blathered about the systems side there s a lot of information out there on packetizing and streaming analog data ranging from development of streaming protocols such as rtp to details of voice packetization for gsm cdma and voip

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
however i m not sure where to put the output statement or what the for-loop inside loops should loops over i d think the size of the inner arrays

9057253
for-loop	arrays
have tried to think of something that sort arrays t and use for-loop to go through s and use binary search to see if i find integer like k - s i for every element in s

9057271
disk	ram
that s basically possible but it would take hours as hard disk access is so much slower than accessing ram caches

9057277
put	get
what i want to do is that when i write something in column c i want excel to check if it exists in any of the cells in column a then do the following.for example lets say i entered number 33 in c44 and a 35 has also the same value which is 33 then get the value in b 35 then put it in d 44 .sounds so simple but almost impossible

9057279
for-loop	arrays
at that point you have an arrays of animals objects so you can use the same solution as above a single for-loop to iterate through each of the animals object and perform some action on them one-by-one

9057331
width	height
282 width and 337 height are integer division - when the denominator is larger than the numerator you will get 0 as a result

9057332
integer	fractions	width	height
because 282 337 width and height are all integers the operator performs an integer division truncating any fractions part of the result

9057366
serializable	deserialization
reflection is used to build the class maps but reflection is no longer needed while doing the serializable deserialization

9057366
serializable	deserialization
you could speed up serializable deserialization a little bit by writing your own handcoded serializable for your classes or by making your classes implement ibsonserializable but since the bottleneck is probably the network anyway it probably isn t worth it

9057391
put	get
the only way i can get it to work correctly is if i put it inside a table

9057465
getter	setter
what you are doing there is probably assuming that __construct or any setter getter should be called by the orm

9057472
portrait	landscape
i have a sencha touch 1.1 phonegap 1.3 application and i ve got a portrait and landscape launch image sized according to the ios documentation

uiview	uipagecontrol
i made a class that manages a uiscrollview a uipagecontrol and an array of uiview

9057530
zoo	xts
edit i realize my error was because my function testfun returned a zoo object and apply.daily requires an xts object

9057530
zoo	xts
can anyone suggest to me how i get my testfun to return an xts object instead of a zoo object so i can use apply.daily

9057585
mouseover	mouseleave
wrap your .scroller and .tickpop elements in another element and bind the mouseover and mouseleave events on the wrapper

9057585
mouseleave	mouseenter
add a little settimeout to the closing of .tickpop on mouseleave and call cleartimeout if the mouseenter .tickbox or a .scroller item

9057587
post	put
i need to put a 201 created response code and a location header for a post request but for some reason i am still getting a 302 response

i m having issue with casting double to int in qtdeveloper

9057615
int	double
as you can see in picture bellow x is int and y is double

9057621
addclass	removeclass
to change the class name on the cloned elements you can use the removeclass and addclass methods

9057638
octal	decimal
so our class was given an assignment to convert decimal numbers to their octal representations

9057641
hex	binary
if an application stores values from a function such as md5 or sha1 that returns a string of hex digits more efficient storage and comparisons can be obtained by converting the hex representation to binary using unhex and storing the result in a binary n column

9057641
hex	binary
each pair of hex digits requires one byte in binary form so the value of n depends on the length of the hex string

9057641
hex	binary
if your password salt is also stored in a binary column if it too was a hex string generated through the sha1 function then the last parameter of the zend_auth_adapter_dbtable should be

9057649
skip-lists	tree
there are some newer binary search tree designed for parallelism that sometimes outperform the skip-lists here is one such data structure though i expect that there will be fewer existing implementations and discussion of these newer structures

9057651
int	boolean
method.invokenative object object class class class int boolean line not available native method

9057667
pop-up	dialog
if you create a modal pop-up with the modal dialog as the parent it should already be shown above the modal dialog

9057673
textview	simpleadapter
i also have a custom simpleadapter in which i override the getview method and am able to retrieve clicks on the textview and checkbox changes

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m using nsuserdefaults to keep an object in sync across several uiviewcontroller s that are used in a uitabbarcontroller

9057757
children	parent
at a bare minimum your children will need to know of an interface or worse the parent itself to implement it

9057757
children	parent
which means your children code will be tied to the parent code

9057757
children	parent
also with mvvm knowing the parent does not mean that the inotifypropertychanged event will occur on your children automatically

9057757
children	parent
or when instantiating the the children add a propertychanged event on the parent that updates the child

9057889
typedef	struct
create a struct and typedef both named node -- standard trick for self referential struct

9057893
typedef	struct
if you change typedef struct to typedef struct node that error will be gone

9057899
hash	md5
i am saving a struct which contains a string which is the result of hashing the bytes of another string with md5 and then encoding the hash sum bytes into a string with hex

9057925
queue	fifo
the extra thread the main thread listens for new connections with the listen system call accepts the new connections with accept then determines which worker thread currently has the least number of connections acquires a lock mutex for that worker thread s pending connections fifo queue places the descriptor for the accepted connection onto the worker thread s pending connections fifo queue and sends a check your queue notification using a pipe to the worker thread

9057925
queue	fifo
if when a worker thread receives a check your queue notification from the main thread it would acquire the lock mutex for its pending connections fifo queue and add any newly accepted connections to its fd_set list

9057933
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
a superclass is a parent or base class that is derived or inherited from by a child class or subclassing

9057946
ubuntu	mint
in a bash shell script on ubuntu mint i need to create some symlinks in the jre lib ext directory under the java installation directory

9057947
int	chars
an easy way to implement this would be using a map of stacks such as where location is a class you create that holds two int s a line number and a chars number

9057982
youtube	vimeo
i made some progress on this with the php transfer youtube to vimeo tool i made

9057986
int	chars
to make an int from a single-digit chars use this code snippet

9057986
int	chars
therefore when you subtract the code of 0 which is denoted as 0 in c from a single-digit chars you get the int value of the corresponding digit

9058005
google-chrome	firefox
code is working in firefox and ie and i try to not use iframe because google-chrome keep caching old page

9058010
int	chars
chars s are just small int s so userchar - 0 assuming userchar has a chars with a value between 0 and 9 has a value of 0 to 9

9058050
int	chars
however in int expressions types smaller than int are promoted to int so you can don t need a cast to convert a chars to an int

9058050
int	chars
the last thing that you need to know is that whatever the int equivalent of the chars 1 is the actual value is unimportant it is 1 more than the int equivalent for 0

9058050
int	chars
in other words the chars 0 1 ... 9 are represented by a contiguous range of int and the same is true for a b ... z and a b ... z

9058050
int	chars
therefore if you know a chars is a digit because you ve used isdigit you get it s int equivalent using

9058063
post	get
i am trying to build rpm for my java code.rpm build and install sections works fine.but later i have added a shell script in post section to run shell script file that creates some files and starts the java application.the file gets copied fine.but in post section i get the failed dependencies bin sh error.i am building the rpm on linux machine and target machines are centos.i have also tried autoreqprov no in spec file.i am not running the install as a root user.also target machines are not expected to have ant iam using it to build the java code-this might be not related to the problem on them.i am attaching the code below.default location of installation is in tmp folder. for testing

9058121
google-chrome	firefox
for example when it is a slow connection the detection method fails because it thinks that the file is a stream and when it is a fast connection or google-chrome - that preloads the stream faster than firefox it thinks the file is corrupt and skips playing and starts the next file

9058163
onkeyup	onkeydown
you could use onkeypress onkeydown or onkeyup to get that change quicker

9058163
submit	submission
following your comment you should add a submit event to the form that would compare the current state of the textbox before submission the form.

9058164
implements	extends
i ve only implements it for one- and two- parameter functions but it shouldn t be a problem to extends this

9058164
g++	gcc
by implementing doit as a macro and using variadic macros a gcc g++ extension it is possible to have a fully variadic solution with the function name appearing first

9058183
int	double
in the middle of the code you re using int instead of double

9058190
bash	zsh
suffix aliases are the only reason i m considering to switch to zsh but i want to stick with bash

9058203
pascal	delphi
if subpixel accuracy without gpu dependency is needed i would recommend antigrain geometry or it s pascal cousin aggpas for delphi

9058227
nsurl	nsstring
i m trying to convert a nsurl to a nsstring to use elsewhere in my program

9058253
post	get
i ve tried a bunch of things to get this working using php s curl library but i just can t seem to get it to not use post which their servers kick out with an error

9058257
stdout	fflush
we found that grep fflush its output when it writes to stdout but not to a file

9058289
installation	upgrade
this line is now raising an exception i suspect my web host has upgrade it s php installation

9058333
puts	gets
however if the user puts in an invalid number gets an error changes their mind and backspaces the phone number field the error message should go away

9058361
fadein	fadeout
my main problem using scriptaculous fadeout fadein effects is that when one is triggered before the other has finished the effects conflict and the element misbehaves

9058414
ubuntu	debian
note that this conflicts with the command-not-found debian and ubuntu packages so you may need to uninstall or otherwise unconfined this package for reliable results

9058432
put	get
suppose you put an alert helloworld in the partial -- it would get triggered twice

9058433
google-chrome	firefox
many things supported by firefox or google-chrome are not available in ie even newer versions

9058437
mouseleave	mouseenter
obviously you can refactor that in several ways but basically all you need to do is observer the mouseenter and mouseleave events and remember to cancel any running effect before starting a new one

9058524
put	get
retrieval operations including get generally do not block so may overlap with update operations including put and remove

9058567
width	border-box
just set it to border-box to subtract the padding and border from the box s width or content-box to render the padding outside of the specified width

9058572
llvm	clang++
i am using clang++ with llvm version 3.0 and generating arm binaries

9058579
put	get
get your info and ctrl+a copy all the information then put all the words into this textarea. the xdebug will tell you the xdebug s version and config put the end of your php.ini file

9058604
comparator	icomparer
i guess the type with which pqueue is instantiated has to implement comparator icomparer

9058609
button	checkbox
i have the following jquery script to transform a checkbox into a jquery-ui button and set up the icons to be displayed

9058615
uilabel	uibutton
i read that uilabel aren t meant to respond to touch events and that i could just use a uibutton

9058636
octal	decimal
first of all a number is not decimal or octal

9058636
octal	decimal
decimal and octal refer to different string representations of a number

9058636
octal	decimal
that is decimal and octal etc

9058636
octal	decimal
only make sense when talking about strings and a particular number can be converted into a string as decimal or octal or whatever

9058636
octal	decimal
instead you are trying to pack it back into a number in such a way that the resulting number s decimal representation would look like what the octal representation of the original number would look like

9058636
octal	decimal
this happens to be possible since any octal representation is also a valid decimal representation of some number

9058636
octal	hex	octal	decimal
this wouldn t be possible with hex for example. in other words you are converting a number to its octal string representation then parsing that string into a number as if it were a decimal representation

9058636
octal	decimal
for example take the number 42 whose decimal representation is the string 42 and octal representation is the string 52

9058660
rvm	bundler
if you provide more detail rvm bundler etc. it may be of help

9058665
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	mp3	ogg	wav	aiff	wav	ogg	aiff	ogg
is there any way to know if a file extension is supported by bass audio library such as wav aiff mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg

9058674
preorder	postorder
is it possible to just by changing a few things achieve preorder and postorder traversal using the same algorithm

9058696
width	height
specifically the image string source number x number y number width number height method within this class

9058715
post	get
values are set by the form as long as the form s method is set to get rather than post which doesn t submit the values in the url

9058722
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
after finish go to about in xcode menu bar and check to see the xcode versioning again to make sure the upgrade installation was successful

9058739
int	chars
read the variable as a chars check if it is between 0 and 9 chars zero and chars nine and if it is cast it to an int like so

9058746
int	chars
you can read the int in with scanf and then convert it to a chars by adding 0

9058746
int	chars
since digits are always represented sequentially this will convert any single digit int to its corresponding chars value

9058756
hide	fadeout
when you do this the hide method is run immediately after the fadeout method is called as opposed to waiting for the fadeout method to finish

9058756
hide	fadeout
as an aside there is no need to call hide here because fadeout actually does this for you at the very end

9058807
int	double
int double 0

9058884
post	get
you will get a much better response if you post this on sublime text s forum sublimetext.com forum

9058902
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the code that i have works in google-chrome and safari but does not work in firefox and ie

9058908
post	put	post	get	put	get
if your application is only concerned with put post delete get on a resource your documentation could easily explain that

9058924
int	double
either t is a built in number type like int double etc

9058940
stdout	stderr
that means create 2 processes which is very slow 2mb of stack for each full process information such as ip address registers stdin stdout stderr ...

9058975
folder	directory
could the .svn directory be stored somewhere else so when i do a full checkout it s using those folder or cached information causing the partial checkouts

9058987
pop-up	dialog
when you click that button a dialog pop-up with two buttons one labeled don t close dialog and another labeled close dialog

9059005
outputstream	inputstream
you can talk to someone remotely with the outputstream and listen using the inputstream

9059012
implements	extends
it s more cumbersome to implements but extends more gracefully

9059037
oncreate	recreate
you should use onsaveinstancestate to save your state and then recreate it in oncreate

9059069
put	get
the workaround is to get a copy of the vertex from the list update it and put a copy of it back

9059098
std	ostream
have you tried std ostream

9059109
msdeploy	webdeploy
i have the following task in my msbuild script to deploy to a remote server using webdeploy msdeploy service

9059126
equals	gethashcode
but you should also implement equals and gethashcode

9059145
google-chrome	firefox
i seem to happen only on flash flowplayer firefox google-chrome android+flash

9059151
inherited	properties
your vm is not a frameworkelement so it has no datacontext properties presumably it is not freezable either and hence might lack an inherited context too so i suspect that this won t work

9059180
submit	submission
this happens prior to the actual submission so we can cancel the submit action by calling .preventdefault on the event object or by returning false from our handler

9059183
mouseover	mouseout
you have to use mouseover and mouseout events because hover with two separate callback functions is not supported with .on at least it wasn t the last time i checked

9059201
int	chars
where as s1 and s2 are simply struct pointers that have a chars pointer and an unsigned int in them

9059201
free	malloc
if there is enough space in the char pointer for s2 to fit into s1 including 0 and it doesn t free and call malloc again it just assigns with the for-loop will it keep the original contents of s1

9059209
mouseover	mouseleave
i want to have an element with a fixed small height that expands to his full height on a mouseover and shrinks back when mouseleave

9059211
width	height
then just divide the width with how many sprites are there in a column and divide the height with how many sprites are there in a row

9059212
int	chars
for example if the user enters 1 followed by 0 you need to compute the int value 10 from those two chars

9059221
free	malloc
including 0 and it doesn t free and call malloc again it just

9059221
free	malloc
if there is enough space you don t need to free or malloc again

9059247
serializable	deserialization
it uses reflection once per type to generate a serializable using reflection.emit so serializable or deserialization of the first object might be slow but any objects afterward are fast relatively

9059296
clang	llvm
as another data point apple s been converting from gcc to llvm with and without clang

9059296
llvm	clang++
llvm has traditionally had issues with some c++ and while llvm-gcc is now a lot better there still seem to be issues with clang++

9059380
folder	directory
go to search directory and under compiler link it to the path of your curl-7.24.0-devel-mingw32 include folder

9059411
moq	nmock
moq and nmock rhinomock will not help you here

9059414
uiview	subviews
alternatively you could instantiate the new subviews with the full image set it with the original uiimageview s frame and then using a uiview animation block set it to the newer frame

9059420
uilabel	uibutton
so my app has the uibutton and uilabel but nothing else is showing up in my app

9059428
wordpress	vbulletin
ensure any popular web applications like wordpress or vbulletin are updated

9059484
google-chrome	firefox
this is windows only but needs to support google-chrome firefox and internet explorer

9059550
int	double
int streamposition double wavfileformat_samplespersec double wavfileformat_bitspersample 8

9059605
fadein	hide
a similar syntax applies to other jquery methods like fadein hide etc

9059636
iprincipal	iidentity
even then you still should use the base iprincipal and iidentity functions that membership and formsauth implement

9059645
hide	show
in all modern browser i tested it so far it works but in ie8 the div fadetoggle just show hide

9059685
msdeploy	webdeploy
if you want webdeploy aka msdeploy to natively support this feature please vote on it at

9059732
nofollow	noindex
some of our front end developers have noindex nofollow code on the pages and we are told this is to prevent google and others from blacklisting the site as trying to have multiple links all going to the same content think somerepcode representing over 1000 sales representatives with nearly the exact same page minus name and contact number shown

9059734
portrait	landscape
refer to and specifically check out the providing alternative resources section - you can have the layout system use different layouts depending on whether your device is in landscape or portrait mode automatically

9059734
setcontentview	findviewbyid
then you will only have a single call to setcontentview and all the findviewbyid s ..

9059777
post	put
also be sure to put quotes around attribute values in your form and post value

9059804
single-quotes	double-quotes
ps replace double-quotes with single-quotes in str2

9059844
cpu	processors
having said that you can realize performance benefits with a multi-threaded algorithm on a single core cpu despite the fact that you only have one processors

9059854
rspec	capybara
when running my specs with rspec capybara it can t find capybara s visit method

9059964
google-chrome	firefox
it s working in firefox and google-chrome

9059976
nofollow	noindex
all links that go to www.site.com or www.site.com page.html as opposed to www.site.com somerepcode page.html should not have the noindex nofollow set

9059976
nofollow	noindex
all links going to mirrors www.site.com somerepcode ... should have the noindex nofollow set

9060018
firefox	safari
i can t speak for safari but in firefox there is a marvelous addon called greasemonkey that does exactly what you want execute arbitrary js of your choosing creation on arbitrary websites

9060085
g++	gcc
if using gcc or g++ that is done using the -g option

9060129
width	height
is there any way to allow only the width to resize and not height

9060156
subtract	add
i have defined an instruction set which only have load store move add and subtract operation

9060170
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
if the arrays 12 10 0 0 ......0 the for-loop needs to consider only the non-zero elements so loops should get executed only twice..once for 12 and next for 10

9060170
for-loop	arrays
similarly if the arrays is 0 0 0 ......0 then for-loop should not executed at all since all elements are zero

9060170
for-loop	arrays
if the arrays is 12 10 5 0 17 8 0 0 ....... 0 then the for-loop should get executed for the first 6 elements even though one of the inner elements is zero

9060180
background-color	transparency
add the style attribute to table and set it to background-color transparency

9060183
int	double
but with int float long double etc i cannot do this

9060192
children	parent
for me i would build the tree in a top down fashion create the parent node before the children

9060204
folder	directory
the output directory should not be saved in svn so you should add it as an ignored resource right click on the output folder go to the team sub-menu and select add to svn ignore

9060208
fgets	getline
there is one difference fgets reads the line and n is included in the string while getline reads the line but delimiter n is not stored

9060234
width	height
if you set those equal to your viewport height only the width will be resizable

9060253
width	height
going with anthonywjones i m pretty sure width or height is something like double.nan

9060253
width	height
make sure you place a check to see is width and height is a real number

9060694
punctuation	words
we just iterate over every words remove punctuation and make it lowercase

9060713
disk	ram
my potentially crazy idea is to have an a master database that runs entirely in ram either as a memory table or as innodb backed by a ram disk and then replicate to a slave for slightly delayed persistence

9060743
onfocus	onblur
i found that adding onblur and onfocus events to inline bypassed the issue

9060765
hide	show
however i can t use listview because my list is a nested list and the frameworks default behavior is hide the nested list and show it once the its primary list is clicked

9060823
int	chars
when working with chars buffers in c sometimes it would be useful and more efficient to able to work with int -sized chunks of data at a time

9060832
sorting	filtering
include operation doesn t support filtering or sorting

9060859
onenote	ms-office

9060993
getter	setter
however if outside agents still need access to it then you should provide a getter and setter method for this job

9060993
getter	setter
a getter returns the value of the property and a setter lets it get changed in a controlled way

9060993
getter	setter
getter and setter let you do such things as make a property read only or implement lazy-initialization meaning that if the class needs to do some expensive operation to

the first problem here is that there is no way yet to have an argument to increase the minorversion when branch the project the maven-release-plugin 2.2.2 does not increment the pom.xml minorversion on trunk when branching so that s why we need to use -dproject.rel. groupid projectid 1.0.0-snapshot

9063149
stdout	stderr
you cannot read from stderr and stdout in the script engine in this way as there is no non-blocking io as code master bob says

9063149
stdout	stderr
if the called process fills up the buffer about 4kb on stderr while you are attempting to read from stdout or vice-versa then you will deadlock hang

9063149
stdout	stderr
you will starve while waiting for stdout and it will block waiting for you to read from stderr

9063149
stdout	stderr
the practical solution is to redirect stderr to stdout like this

9063149
stdout	stderr
the incantation redirects prog.exe s stderr to stdout

9063149
stdout	stderr
you can now succeed by reading from stdout and ignoring stderr

9064128
snmp	mib
attempting to run a mib based snmp script and i running into an issue

9064140
viewdidload	viewwillappear

since the date and commit message will be different for each client the repositories will become unrelated and hg push and hg pull will then error out if you try to mix changesets from different clients

9065765
post	get
i imagine get is fine so is post possible

9065875
tabcontrol	tabitem
reading the first and last element in the tabcontrol.items list does not work because it is possible to add a non-tabitem control a button to a tabcontrol which is then written into the tabcontrol.items list and thus can not be casted to a tabitem

if i add a button to a tabcontrol the tabcontrol automatically creates a tabitem but i don t know how to access it

hide	show	slideup	slidedown
but the problem is when i want to use slideup and slidedown instead of show and hide

i check the checkbox in r1 r2 and r3 one by one and then i click save button

9067040

in ondraw method i get view s width and height via getwidth and getheight and using these values i scale and move my image

everything is fine with that but sometimes when orientation has changed my imageview in ondraw still remember old values of it s width and height

9067310
cout	cin
what i am finding curious is when i call cout in the main function and i am running the program the console appears and displays nothing when i press a letter and enter the program returns 0 as if it were at the cin statement but the console will not even display the letter i have pressed

9067404
ssl	https
i also tried terminating the ssl using node.js https server and the performance was very similar to pound stunnel and stud so no clear advantage to that approach

our desktops are running ubuntu 11.10 with python-odbc 2.1.7-1build1 and our server has gentoo not my decision with pyodbc-2.1.8

9067664
onclick	onmousedown
the main difference is that while onmousedown triggers regardless of which mouse-button was pressed onclick triggers only for the left mouse button - which will be most likely what you want

9067679
xlsx	xlsm
as i understand it backgroundchecking is a setting specific to the excel application itself and nothing that could be set in the xls or xlsx xlsm file format itself

9067692
x86	64bit
however if your application did not exceed the limits of 32-bit you may deploy the application on x86 only anyway it should also work on 64bit os via 32-bit virtualization

9067745
uiview	subviews
a much much more elegant solution is to use a uiview subclass though this isn t always appropriate and recalculate all your subviews on a parent s frame change and be smart only recalculate them if the new frame size has changed use cgrectequaltorect to compare the new frame when you override setframe and before you call

9067745
hide	show	drawrect	layoutsubviews
the naive implementation would be to override drawrect don t a better one would be to just use layoutsubviews and then in the uiviewcontroller or whatnot you can call view setneedslayout in a single method that is called for either show or hide

9067824
put	get
i m trying to put all my variables into a class but i get errors

9067841
virtuoso	tdb
if you want to use the data you might want to look into loading it in a triple store 4store virtuoso jena tdb ... and use sparql to query it

9067853

but most likely you misnamed the variables or sent them via get instead of post

9067947

android custom popupwindow dialog

9068057
put	get
change your line to put an echo in front and you get

9068069
int	chars
firstly it should be noted that date and time values should always be stored as those types and together as timestamp not as individual fields not as int or chars types - the headaches you run into just aren t worth it mostly relating to invalid values

9068070
portrait	landscape
create a portrait and landscape layout in a datatemplate

9068096
post	put
you could put the values in hidden fields so they are posted to your post action you can then bundle them in the actionresult of the post method

9068114
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	setcontentview	setcontentview	findviewbyid
you are using findviewbyid inside oncreate of your world activity but you did not call setcontentview before it

9068115
post	get
then on the post action it can accept a parameter of the same class the model will automatically get the values from the form variables it will automatically matches values to properties of the model whenever possible

9068194
777	tmp
i both tried the tmp folder and a different folder with chmod 777

cpu	processors
some very old processors didn t have fast shift hardware in which case a lookup might be considerably faster - especially as cpu speeds tended to be the same as memory speeds back then

9068751
getter	setter
that isn t necessary if you re just doing trivial getter setter methods we re not writing java here... but since you mention that there is other business logic involved i think that s a good design decision

9068811
put	get
i supposed that you can call in your jquery code to get the object and do something i think could work because if you put a click event that fires an alert in the first element it works

9068864
nsresponder	nsapplication
you need to implement flagschanged in the same class where you implement this -keydown method or just any nsresponder subclass that may be able to catch this event the nsapplication

9068937
width	margin
the problem is that it is getting the width of the parent container which if you go far enough back is taking the width of your browser window and then adding the margin

9068950
cos	sqrt
also the functions has names in lowercase cos log sqrt

put	get
put another way any incoming packets destined for port 9923 on your public ip address will get forwarded to port 9923 on your android s ip address

width	height
it is as though the client layout s width and height are scaled to that larger than the form allows but should it not still fill the form s area

9069078
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
opera is likely referencing document.dayselector.value whereas firefox and google-chrome are referencing window.dayselector.value

fast-forward	merge
the --no-ff flag prevents git merge from executing a fast-forward if it detects that your current head is an ancestor of the commit you re trying to merge

9069127
fast-forward	merge
a fast-forward is when instead of constructing a merge commit git just moves your branch pointer to point at the incoming commit

9069127
fast-forward	merge
similarly if you want to execute a git pull or use git merge in order to explicitly fast-forward and you want to bail out if it can t fast-forward then you can use the --ff-only flag

9069134
post	get
is it possible to to use a get value file from an ajax request into an other reqest post as file

9069198
width	height
i just want a simple one that works i don t want any fancy animations unless that plugin works great one i have had worked perfect in firefox however in webkit it would autogrow when you typed even before the text got to the end of the line and then another autogrow one wouldn t allow me to set the height width to specific values

integer	fractions
integer part of returned value is the number of seconds since midnight and the fractions part can be converted into miliseconds - just multiply it by 1000

9069420
graphics2d	bufferedimage
you might try something like creating a bufferedimage getting its graphics2d and setting its affinetransform to affinetransform.scale -1 1 and then using the graphics2d s drawstring method

9069434
gif	png
i think the simplest way to do this would be to get a set of images of all the letters and symbols use flip them using any conventional graphics software -- paintshoppro photoshop whatever -- save the images as a bunch of individual gif or png files and then retrieve the appropriate one when you need it

9069474
free	malloc

free	malloc
thus if you make a lot of calls to malloc and free with varying memory size requests it could in theory cause a condition called memory fragmentation where there is enough space in the free-store to allocate your requested memory block but not enough contiguous space for the size of the block you ve requested

this does have a slight disadvantage in that you are taking on a slightly higher server-side load but i would be very careful when it comes to increasing the client-side load time since that is a critical metric for user happiness and engagement

9070776
client-side	server-side
collections of server-side classes lists arrays etc. easier to handle when represented client-side flash by mx.collections.arraycollection

9070776

i am using the database first approach with entity framework when i used to work on the default template the database tables were mapped using the objectcontext so i used to create #partial classes metadatatype typeof to apply the data annotation but when i start using the dbcontext code generation template to map the database tables i found that it will create .tt folder in my model area were i find that i can apply the data annotation directly to the .cs classes themselves without the need to create partial classes as in objectcontext case

free	malloc
their proposed solution is no better they malloc copy and then free the original which has the same net effect - the address has changed

9071767
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
if you re gambling on realloc never moving always growing then you ve probably got bigger problems to worry about anyway and switching to malloc + copy + free can t possibly solve that

9071767

.each show hide toggleclass addclass removeclass function

9071939
auto-generate	edmx
the presence of this separate definition of the partial class will cause this code to be effectively merged with the auto-generate book class when the assembly is compiled but it allows you to have this special custom code in a separate file which won t be affected when you regenerate the model data from the edmx file

9071945
children	parent
unfortunately you are forced to load the children from the database to delete the parent correctly

9071960

9072260
namedtuple	dictionary
since you have a static set of keys for your data dictionary a namedtuple from the collections module would actually be better than the anonymous dictionary

9072260
namedtuple	dictionary
namedtuple have a lower overhead than dictionary since the duplicate keys don t have to be stored per item but have the convenience of named access

9072270
int	double
imho you may also need to change all your int double and bool typed variables to int double and bool types

9072274
multiplying	add
it s true that both 640 360 and 1280x720 use an aspect ration of 1.777777777777778 multiplying 480 by 1.777777777777778 gives 853.3333333333333 which i think makes youtube add this nasty black bars

9072275

i discovered that when the text is too short for it to start the marquee the textview and the imageview disappear as stated earlier they appear for a split second then disappear

9072401
textview	imageview
i got it to work by calling postinvalidatedelayed 500 on my imageview and textview after calling videoview.start

9072409
portrait	landscape
it s frustrating because i always have to manually check to see if the phone is in landscape or portrait mode to account for rotation and if i have to set up my subviews in a specific way that i can t do with autoresizing then i also have to do manual calculations

9072514
textview	imageview
ordering matters the textview and the imageview would be covered by the videoview

9072514
textview	imageview
in this case videoview then imageview then textview

9072520
xslt	schematron
although implementations exist that work directly with schematron schemas the canonical model is to first transform the schema into an xslt style sheet using stylesheets available at the schematron home page which can then be used to validate the input document by transforming it into schematron validation report language svrl a language used for reporting the results of a schematron validation

9072606

9076517
spaces	delimiter
it wasn t 100 clear on whether the first delimiter spaces was a tab or a variable number of spaces so i just used echo to squeeze them all into 1 spaces here

i have a website that is working properly.i dont know when i do domain-name.com images it shows me all the images in the images folder present at my site.i dont know why is this.may be this is due to the directory permissions

9076569
folder	directory
this is because there is no index file in the folder and apache assuming apache is set to do directory indexes

9076595
folder	directory
if it s a web accessible directory meaning it resides in the typical webroot folder such as public_html www etc and the permissions on the folder are open then anyone can see the contents

hide	show
alternatively you can also add a second label and hide show it

9076790
mouseleave	mouseenter
istead of adding the class by javascript since hover is not working in ie on other elements but the a element but mouseenter and mouseleave are i prefer the js solution

9076814
hide	show
the way i m doing it is by passing a frompage attribute in the session and making a decision to show or hide the search component

9076842
hide	show
i would just include both as normal in the html and then hide show as needed

9076849
gridview	objectdatasource
i m using objectdatasource with gridview using custom paging getting per page records the sorting works fine but only for current page

9076850

uipopoverbackgroundview	uipopovercontroller
the hack is a category on uipopovercontroller and i just put it in the files for my subclass of uipopoverbackgroundview

9077048
mvp	presenter
i never used mvvm so i m not sure how it applies in this case but in case of mvp you can use long living context if it is used for single operation - for example edit view will be handled by its own presenter with its own context

9077068
vpn	wlan
i would like also to distinguish between specific types of those devices wlan ethernet virtual vpn ...

9077088
getter	setter
i d like to either route the getter setter methods to .attr the example above i just related them to .data or better the native setattribute and getattribute

9077088

how to reload grid data when navigating the treelist

9077239
try-catch	exception-handling

why evaluate in the getter and not in the setter

9077436
width	height
i have a video file and i want to get width and height of video

9077436

how can i get width and height of video

9077439
uiwebview	nsurlprotocol
by implementing and registering a subclass of nsurlprotocol you can capture all the request from your uiwebview

9077540
mouseover	mouseout
put your thumbnail inside a div with light colored border default later on mouseover find the div and change the style border-width and border-color although it is not a fadding style but as user quickly mouseover and mouseout on the image looks like minor fadding effect that is enough i guess

9077550
getter	setter
so if i interpret your question correctly - you want to know if it is a good practice to use setter getter

9077550
getter	setter
but if you have some cases where you have to have different getter setter then do not do it

9077626
min	max
how are min and max being used here

9077665
min	max
of course for the first call you could determine min and max from the tree but for subsequent ones you must pass down like this

9077689
range	min	range	max	min	max
min max represents the range in which a valid value in the current node could be

9077689
min	max
that is why we change the min and max values for them respectvely

9077691
min	max	minimum	max
here min max specifies the minimum value stored in tree and the maximum value stored in the tree

9077749
equals	gethashcode
kirill gave already a good answer but i use some kind of improved schema for implementation of the operators including a correct implementation of equals and gethashcode in the following way

9077753
serializable	deserialization
objects will be serializable before being placed in the session thus they will be fully fledged when they are retrieved form the session due to deserialization

9077754
getter	setter
also you cannot write a custom getter setter and leave the other as it is

9077775
width	height
in this code i am giving the width and height of the bar graph.i want to give device height and width.how to do that

9077840
memcmp	strcmp
routines strcmp for comparing and memcmp for everything else do they run faster on memory block on x86_64 which is somehow aligned how

9077855
width	height
width height of the modal to which i want to resize the colorbox modal

9077855
width	height
probably you should try calling this function after some time period using settimeout this will help to calculate the width height to set hope this helps..

9077869
width	height
multiply all your x and width parameter with x_width and all your y and height parameters with y_height

9077904
inherited	subclassing
since pulltorefreshtableviewcontroller is a subclassing of uitableviewcontroller i think i can t make my controller inherited from it am i right

9077970
profiling	debugging
if you re able to debugging the app then you re not using the ad-hoc profiling

9077970

ui-design	master-detail
in general your approach is not bad ui-design but a typical master-detail view

9078009
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the two new indexes created were incompatible with our lucene versioning so we ended up having to upgrade lucene in our solr installation to 2.9.4 which can read 3.0.x indexes

9078022
qabstractitemview	qabstractitemmodel	qtableview	qabstractitemmodel	qtableview	qabstractitemview
qtableview implements the interfaces defined by the qabstractitemview class to allow it to display data provided by models derived from the qabstractitemmodel class

9078039
tcplistener	tcpclient
on the client side i use io socket inet while the server side uses a combination of tcplistener and tcpclient

9078062
width	height
if you know the sizes of the image you can provide width and height attributes then it s going to work even inside domcontentloaded

9078062
domcontentloaded	onload
sometimes it s preferable because onload event takes longer to fire then domcontentloaded

9078075
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

9078087
gridview	repeater
if you are not going to use the paging feature of the gridview control so i suggest that you move to the repeater as it will give you the power to format the table header section and footer and it will give you the power of rendering the table exactly as you want it to be rendered

9078136
width	height
depending on what you want to know you may use a hidden tag with fixed width and height and the scrollleft and scrolltop-properties to find out if the text exceeds the tag dimensions

9078259
realloc	malloc
aligned malloc is posix_memalign that s ok but what about the aligned realloc

9078297
post	get
get works fine both empty form + form populated from db post works fine only for creating new object but doesn t work for editing

9078317
realloc	malloc
realloc behaves the same as malloc so the memory returned by realloc has the same alignment constrain of malloc

9078338
realloc	malloc
if you look at the glibc source code for realloc it calls directly on to malloc

9078366
hash	md5
i suggest you generate a md5 hash of the message and send it along

9078366
hash	md5
if the hash does not match the md5 passed to server it means the user has tampered the data

9078378
post	get
to do that you should get you app album s id than you ll be able to post an image to it like

9078379
yacc	lemon
for the lexer you re probably going to use nsscanner the parser for your grammar is easy to write by hand see for example or you can use a tool like yacc or lemon

9078415
gridview	sqldatasource
i have this gridview and i use sqldatasource

9078421
folder	directory
this means that when the testsolutiona is built all the files and folder which have been referenced in this solution are checked out to a check out directory and then the solution builds

9078462
accelerometer	gyroscope
while there is no gyroscope on the 3gs it is perfectly capable of detecting device orientation changes using the accelerometer it has build in

9078501
button	checkbox
as list view sub child checkbox can use setoncheckchangeslistener in base adapter class directly.now you just have to keep track record of check checkbox and their corresponding position in arraylist.now when you click on delete button then remove element from arraylist and call notifydatasetchanged

9078525
prepare	execute
the data mappers execute prepare statements via the zend db adapter

9078547
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome but when i try to get it to work with firefox it refuses to load the html5 video i have linked

9078555
pull	push
i know i can use git to push pull from a central repository but it s not transparent as i have to push before switching computer

9078627
free	realloc
a just keep in mind that neither posix nor linux man pages specify whether or not you even can pass these pointers to realloc only that you can pass them to free

9078627
free	realloc
in that case free may have been made intelligent since the specs say it must be able to handle the allocations done by posix_memalign but realloc may not have been given the same intelligence since the docs are silent on that matter

9078627
free	realloc
however based on gnu glibc 2.14.1 it actually allocates more memory than needed then fiddles with the arena to free up the pre-space and post-space so that the address returned is a real address usable by free or realloc

9078645
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it works in different ways in firefox google-chrome and in ie9 opera

9078645
google-chrome	firefox
it shows about 60 fps i guess should be 30 in firefox 9.0.1 and google-chrome 16.0.912.77 m

9078809
google-chrome	firefox
is there a recommended way of retrieving the current url given the hwnd of google-chrome firefox or ie

9078825

9079168
button	checkbox
i have a situation i have web site in html5 with some controls like button checkbox ect. and native application with uiwebview

9079231
dbcontext	objectcontext
does anyone know if there is an alternative for dbcontext otherwise what is the point of dbcontext if all the examples i find for deleting a child object all use objectcontext

9079276
sudo	passwd
programs like sudo read the passwd directly from the terminal device not from stdin so this is unfortunately not a trivial thing to do

9079276
sudo	passwd
what you would do is use runtime.exec to execute the expect program supplying a script that just runs sudo mount watches for the passwd prompt and provides the passwd

9079278
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
i would seriously consider using an mvvm framework for view composition - caliburn.micro for example makes viewmodel first development extremely straightforward and already provides a viewmodel base class which implements inotifypropertychanged and a mechanism for building view compositions with conventions

9079278
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
caliburn.micro also has a host of other features such as being able to place a button control with on your view and your save method on your viewmodel will automatically be invoked when the button is clicked

9079437
decimal	ieee
no c# decimal doesn t follow the same rules as ieee 754 floating point numbers

at a very basic level all you have to do is point the image source tag at the phpthumb script with the required width height and file location in the get string

9079517
qcombobox	qspinbox
hi would like to populate a qcombobox with a number of items which equals a variable set in a qspinbox

you should copy the matched url to your newsurl ivar or make your newsurl ivar a copy properties and set the value through the accessor method

9079679
put	get
and if you really want to get fancy you can put the whole process to the gpu too one example that sounds interesting is but there will be more coming up when you use google

9079701
clang	llvm
you could also get involved in a compiler project perhaps something like the llvm s clang project

9079734
folder	directory
this perl script will look at each pair of files in the directory folder being compared that are the same and rename one of them to be the same as the other so that the two folder can be run through beyond compare which will do a full binary compare if the flatten folder option is switched on

9079738

i want cargo maven plugin to start a tomcat7 so i put into my pom.xml

9079837
post	get
as far as i see using jsonp i have to send the callback and the data using get jquery allows to use post as method but when i inspect web traffic i see it is sending actually get and everyting as parameter

9079837
post	get
jsonp also requires changes in the server because they are expecting a post request with json data and they have to implement something to process the jsonp get request

9079891
multiplying	add
as a simple optimization if the constant is 2 as it was in your example you could replace the multiplying with an add instruction instead not requiring any constant

9079907
uilabel	uibutton
i have a custom uibutton with uilabel added as subview

9079957
width	height
what i did was i gave every element in the page relative positioning using the universal selector then made a class .bg with absolute positioning 100 width and height a negative z-index so it will display below the content

9079979
put	get
sure put in in the jar then get an url using getclass .getresource

9079992
google-chrome	firefox
the code seems to be working on google-chrome and firefox

9080168
switching	screens
when i switching between zoom to fill screens and stretch to fill screens my application will crash

9080192
implements	extends
you ll need to extends my suggestion from the mailing-list for everything that implements idisposable inside your loop since it can allocate memory much more quickly than the gc will be able to collect it

9080200
post	get
i am using wininet api in order to access web services http post and download files hosted on web server http get

9080260
implements	extends
create a new filedatasource say zipfiledatasource and extends the filedatasource and implements the getinputstream method

9080288
magento	oscommerce
however the magento started from this with oscommerce realised the problems limitations and built a far more sensible system with the best programming methods

9080288
magento	expressionengine
thinking you can format magento blocks any better in a cms such as expressionengine and use magento just for the backend will put you on a hiding to nothing to end up with a fairly useless setup that isn t going to go anywhere

9080377
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
from the screenshot it looks like you ve tried to put a uitabbarcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller

9080427
width	height
you can change the height width top and left position to make the glass pane only fit over a certain area

9080429
apache	nginx
another way not sure but possibly change from apache to nginx

9080441
hide	show
if the client has all the data required to perform the price calculation then i would suggest a single form with some show hide functionality as per your second idea

but the div-element had no height or width to begin with and for some reason it works different with or without doctype

9080620
hash	hmac

edit registry settings as outlined in above post hkey_current_user software microsoft microsoft sql server 100 tools shell - change all the paths except mydocumentslocation this is what seems to cause the settings to get reset

9080648
google-chrome	firefox
will be ok in firefox google-chrome but not on ie

9080668
width	height
looks like parent layout repositions it s siblings after you set a new text for the button2 because as describe in xml button2 wraps it s content by width and height

9080687
jtextfield	jtable
now my problem is i want to show the text in the jtextfield by selecting the label from the jtable and clicking on a ok button but i don t now where to start

compareto or equals

9089736
equals	compareto
compareto tells you which and if one is greater less than the other while equals simply tells you if they are equivalent values

9089736
equals	compareto
finally note that these equals and compareto methods are not strictly needed for primitive types like int because the standard comparison operators are overloaded so you could do these

9089736
equals	compareto
equals and compareto work as i have describe for string as well

9089737
equals	compareto
compareto will return an int with -1 or any other negative value for less than 0 for equals or 1 or any other positive value for greater than

9089743
equals	compareto
the functionality in compareto is actually a superset of functionality of equals

9089743
equals	compareto
a compareto function dictates ordering before after or equals while the equals function merely dictates equality

9089743
equals	compareto
hence it s actually possible to define equals in terms of compareto

int	chars
this removes any content after the first space chars ignoring leading spaces and then converts the remainder to a 64bit int which will then remove all leading zeroes

9091539
int	chars
while my answer might seem quite verbose compared to simply select cast substr mycol1 1 5 as bigint from mytable1 but it allows for the space chars to not always be there situations where the mycol1 value is not of the form nnnnn nn if the string is nn nn then the convert to int will fail

9091834
stdout	stderr
i suspect the problem is that you re never reading from stderr - so if the process has filled up whatever buffer it has for stderr but hasn t printed anything to stdout you ll be blocking trying to read stdout

9091834
stdout	stderr
i suggest you start one of the reading loops in a different thread one reads from stdout and one reads from stderr

9091838

9092659
typedef	struct
most of us are well aware that in c in order to create a struct you normally prefix it with a typedef to avoid calling the struct keyword before referencing the object

9092659
typedef	struct
my point is that given that you can already create a struct in c++ which doesn t require the typedef to declare without the struct keyword and using non encapsulated functions which pertained to these struct for an object-oriented approach i was curious to know if there are any advantages to the c approach of coding in c++ which would include using static global functions as private member functions along with global function constructors which would return pointers to objects

9092666
screens	tablet
of course the screens you will be running on is larger than a typical phone screens but with android s support for tablet you have a lot of tools such as fragments available to adjust to take advantage of the screens

9093145
gridview	detailsview
how do i ensure that the gridview displays the correct data after the update in the detailsview

9093145
gridview	detailsview
p.p.s. i discovered this similar question but the answer doesnâ t work it resets the entire page back to pristine state which means the gridview loses its selected row and the detailsview disappears

in django i have created a function decorator which can - in this example - create a lowercase version of a supplied post get argument and it updates the request before the view handles it all

9093299
post	get
i m a bit concerned i hack django s wsgirequest object in such a way other django functionality might not see the updated get post request objects

9093336
width	height
the width and height presumably you are taking this from frame.size have to change because they describing the smallest rectangle that holds the entire rotated view - if you rotate a rectangle by 45 degrees then the rectangle to hold the rotated rectangle is wider and taller than the original rectangle

9093431
children	parent
in case you suggest to add a count column to parent table do you know of any way such that the count will be automatically updated by mysql when i make a change in the children table

9093468
getter	setter
the article at the link also explains how you can customize the process by providing your own persistence delegate but i would try adding getter setter first to see if that is enough to make it work
