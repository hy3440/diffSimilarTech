i want to do several aggregate functions at once eg to get the max and min id s grouped by status

8100193
min	max
volume rms min value max value

8100207
charindex	substr
you could for example use charindex to find the index of the - and then use substr to get the characters up to that point

8100216
accessor	properties
however in section 11.2.1 properties accessor using dot notation were changed from

8100235

this works great locally with webrick but when i deploy to apache using phusion passenger i cannot get the cache to expire

8100300
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
browsers tested internet explorer 6-8 firefox 3 safari 3-4 google-chrome opera 9

8100317
int	chars
since you state that you don t want to use r then you can cast the int to a chars

8100322
int	chars
convert.char byte asciivalue creates a chars from any int

8100332
width	height
let say image 1 width 600px height 600px and image 2 width 50px height 50px.

8100332
width	height
width 600 and height 650px

8100396
dreamweaver	aptana
1 if you are using an ide like dreamweaver or aptana the preview will not show the new subpixel rendering you just enabled

8100425
post	get
for a simple request one that uses either get or post with no custom headers and whose body is text plain the request is sent with an extra header called origin

8100425
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ and google-chrome all support usage through the xmlhttprequest object

8100425
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
the xmlhttprequest object in firefox safari and google-chrome has similar enough interfaces to the ie xdomainrequest object that this pattern works fairly well

8100425
onreadystatechange	onload
onload â use instead of onreadystatechange to detect successes

8100434
apache	nginx
the advantage of using apache or nginx as a proxy is that it can load-balance between different mongrel or thin instances

8100480
draggable	droppable
so you need to find and bind the draggable droppable to the iframe and fire an event to detect and handle that

8100491
width	height
the only thing u can do is to set it s position and height width relative to the closest parent with position relative

8100511
awt	swing
is there a way to create a window using swing or awt that behaves and looks like an inspector window on mac os x

8100516
ceil	floor
substitute round or ceil for floor depending on what behavior you want with rounding

8100522
.htaccess	httpd.conf
after some more looking around i found out that lite version doesn t support .htaccess so only httpd.conf file that works globally

8100558
min	max	width	height
the div has the exact height set with overflow hidden and the img has min max width and height set

8100558
min	max	width	height
all browsers except ie will change the width height to the min max levels without changing the aspect ratio

8100558
width	height
ie changes the aspect ration changes width and height independently

8100570
width	height
so the only criteria that facebook uses to ignore images is the width to height ratio all other images in your page will get picked up and will be an option as a thumbnail

8100571
getter	setter
then from your ide go to code generation options - choose generate getter and setter for both fields

8100577
children	parent
also the node would be responsible for ensuring that the sizes and shapes of its children make sense -- that they don t overlap they fill the entire parent they don t go outside the parent

8100600
onresume	onpause
for whatever reason they queue them up until the activity goes through a onpause onresume cycle then they will fire all their queued events

8100621
width	height
the width and height are unknown variables

8100621
width	height
i can t constrain the width and height because i ll distort the image

8100646
folder	directory
i am trying to allow the user to upload as many images as they want place them all in a new directory based on the title of the form and then write that folder name to the database and i will call it later to do an image dump

8100657
min	max	width	height
instead of using min max width and height

8100661
width	height
yes set height of image height of div extra width will be hidden by overflow div

8100684
opera	firefox
firefox opera and webkit-based browsers have a document-level event domcontentloaded that you can listen for with document.addeventlistener domcontentloaded fn false

8100687
hash	md5
i have had the experience of coding a secure software activation key package in 2001 using pki and md5 hash

8100687
hash	salt
do use a hash digest and salt to store passwords

8100694
hash	whirlpool
using a hash algorithm like sha or whirlpool with a unique input like the users unique username will result in a hash that has an expected collision rate of 0

8100699
int	double
since you didn t use implicit none in rter3 it might do that in which case the bits of integ would be interpreted as an int while they are supposed to be interpreted as double precision -- the value would appear incorrectly

8100721
setinterval	settimeout
simple implementation would be javascript settimeout and setinterval to check server status with trigger stored procedure on mysql

8100749
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this works in all the browsers i ve tested it in google-chrome 15 firefox 7 ie 9 and opera 11.52 all on windows which seems promising

8100781
width	height
but you should add the img programtically and the get the image height and width straight from the object like this and then run the resize function above

8100817
stdout	stderr
i am trying to redirect stdout and stderr to a socket

8100817
stdout	stderr
i tried the flollowing it works but i can only redirect one of stdout or stderr

8100819
google-chrome	firefox
the edit button shows up in google-chrome firefox but not internet explorer with the same exact code base

8100824
openni	kinect
i would like to know if avin2 sensor kinect drivers work with latest versions of openni

8100824
openni	kinect
whats the order of installation and what driver do i install to make kinect work with openni 1.3.4.6

8100834
width	height
both width and height can be individually scaled and the original width - height constraints can be lost but this is of no importance

8100842
ddms	adt
to solve this problem you have to update also android ddms adt and all other components on eclipse

8100845
cgpoint	cgrect
how can i given two different cgpoint turn them into an cgrect

8100865
udp	tcp
i want to identify an udp or tcp packet that have its source ip address faked

8100894
width	height
this will return a rect of width or height 0 if the two points are on a line

8100897
width	height
the absolute value of the difference between x values will be the width and between y values the height

8100906
cos	sin
cos sin etc

8100908
udp	tcp
the way i see it udp and tcp have nothing to do with this

8100911
folder	directory
i have a virtual directory on iis7 that is pointing to a folder inside my application root

8100970
google-chrome	firefox
this works for me in google-chrome and firefox but not ie9

8101004
width	height
i ve been trying to use a table tag but i need the whole screen to be used 100 width and height and i would rather use more modern tags since i will have to end up using canvas in one of those segments anyway

8101023
melt	reshape
i m not sure about the way your data were generated whether you use a combination of cast melt from the reshape package which is what i suspect given the default name of your variables but here is a toy example where sorting is done outside the call to ggplot

8101032
traceroute	packets
yeah you can send ack packets to the fake source address ip and then use traceroute command to know the path of the source packets so that you can atleast find the location of the originating

8101067
serializable	deserialization
i can write the serializable serializable the typerep then serializable the value but i can t figure out how to write the deserialization

8101067
dictionary	map
the basic problem is that given a typerep you need to map back to the type dictionary for that type - and i don t know if that can be done

8101130
udp	tcp
so i ve been programming with tcp for quite a while and decided to pick up udp

8101130
wan	lan
i m not quite sure what needs to be done in order for me to have communication both ways across the wan or lan for that matter easier on lan because i could just open two ports with udp once i send information from client to server how can i respond on that socket

8101148
put	get
we had to put in a special request with rackspace just to get access to that much disk space on our server

8101173
for-loop	arrays
also what is important to point out here if this arrays would have hundreds instead of 8 bookmarks for-loop would probably be statistically about twice faster as it does not have to iterate through rest of the arrays

8101173
for-loop	arrays
but in that case it would probably be a good idea to put for-loop into function which returns first found item which satisfies condition and with prototypejs it probably can even be hooked up to arrays

8101201
portrait	landscape
what is the best approach to change a css file when a mobile application page orientation changes from landscape to portrait and vice versa

8101203
width	height
the code executes without errors and all the width height stride and buffer size values are correct but the bitmap remains black as if wic never touched it

8101234
width	height
let nearplane be the height of the pyramid and w and h the width and height of the pyramid s base

8101239
pop-up	dialog
1 don t use another jframe as pop-up window use jframe with joptionpane dialog jwindow these container are same as jframe but can take parent and owner

8101239
jwindow	jdialog
3 depends if you needed decorated window then use jdialog don t forget look for setmodal or modalitytypes if undecorated then use jwindow

8101239
jwindow	jdialog	joptionpane	jdialog
4 don t create lots of joptionpane jdialog jwindow on fly becasue there object are still in jvm memory create this container once and re-use that by removing child for another action

8101245
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and ie9 all output

8101288
jtextfield	jlabel
if i just put it in jlabel jtextfield and text out of borders it wrap path from the right side like c my documents .

8101319
versioning	upgrade
i was on versioning 2.0.5 and have upgrade to 2.0.10 but that doesn t resolve the issue

8101328
freebsd	solaris
and as was mentioned freebsd and solaris has own implementations

8101350
httprequest	httpresponse
you need to read up on the httprequest and httpresponse classes

8101419
portrait	landscape
just so that i am clear are you saying that you have several tabs which are using different orientations portrait or landscape and you are having issues when switching tabs and setting the corresponding orientations properly

8101445
put	get
in each step you get a position from the queue put each neighbor to the queue change their neighbor data rinse and repeat

8101458
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this only happened in firefox though ie google-chrome and safari didn t register it

8101498
cvs	svn
if you setup your own svn cvs or other source management system you will have to maintain it

8101512
width	height
your constructor takes the arguments by non-const reference but you pass a temporary object dimensions2d width height to it

8101608
libs	buildpath
if you want to know how to load the archive google it s in in project properties java buildpath libs tab swt jar add jar add your swt.jar then expand and edit the javadoc location

8101609
cut	dash
at the request of a couple of you i ll clarify that i want to cut out the second - dash and replace it with a comma and space

8101623
post	get
the request parameter is also null but i m guessing that s because i m doing a get and not a post

8101627
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
i m trying to create an nsdate from nscalendar and nsdatecomponents with

8101655
pem	pkcs#12
i have also tried to change the file extension from txt to pkcs#12 pem in order to be able to import the file into windows certificate store but no success

8101679
int	chars
with php i wanna cut out the int only amongst the strings which are combined by chars + int

8101698
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
rem is supported in safari 5 google-chrome firefox 3.6+ and even internet explorer but for older browsers you still have to use em percent or px

8101756
width	height
width height buffer size format guid and scan size all seem correct

8101760
width	height
and this 2 in there should actually be your window s aspect ratio width height in your case

8101770
hide	show
here is the code i use to show the progress bar and then hide it on page loaded

8101780
getter	setter
making the cs be a member of the object and using the cs inside of property getter setter methods is the correct approach

8101785
width	height
one of these lines should be height not width

8101834
width	height
this sort-of-works if i set the video element s css height width to 100 so it s always the same size as its container

8101834
width	height
however if the containing div s dimensions go below the video image s inherent videowidth or videoheight then it starts to behave as though the css height width properties refer to percentages of the video image s inherent dimensions not the container div

8101844
onresume	onpause
not sure about how to handle the camera during activity lifecycle methods like onpause onresume etc

8101867
for-loop	loops
note the check on data is useless as your code loops elements of data ie if data doesn t exist data.codes.length can only be 0 and the for-loop never starts

8101882
folder	directory
i put it in the main directory not a folder

8101901
ubuntu	linux
the only difference i can possibly thing of is the different linux ubuntu versions i am using on each laptop

8101913
hide	show
and hide progress indicator which is show before ajax call

8101926
getter	setter
if you put a lock inside your getter and setter you can guarantee that your object is internally coherent but users of your object may see multithreading artifacts

8101992
free	malloc
i am struggling to wrap my head around malloc in c - specifically when it needs to be free d

8101992
free	malloc
i gather from the errors i m getting in gcc on program crash that i m just not understanding malloc and free

8101992
free	malloc
everything i see says that whenever i use malloc i need to use free

8102004
width	height
make a div put it on position fixed width 100 and height 100 left 0 top 0

8102010
free	malloc
in general every call to malloc must have one corresponding call to free

8102016
folder	dir
the first rename must be done over file 3.txt and folder 2 and then proceed upwards to above folder but the lines displayed by dir command are sorted in alphabetical order and the other available orders don t help in this case

8102023
free	malloc
well the scope of the malloc d memory lays between calls to malloc and free or otherwise until process is stopped that is when os cleans up for the process

8102023
free	malloc
the error you are getting is most likely either because function returns a pointer to some memory that was not allocated using malloc or it returns a null pointer which you pass to free which you cannot do

8102027
free	malloc
broadly speaking every pointer that is ever returned by malloc must eventually be passed to free

8102029
tiff	png
the sub-folder containers each has files of different file types pdf png jpeg tiff avi and word documents

8102034
hide	show
my first thought is that the interval was quicker than the script was getting rid of the last list item but i have tested this with a interval of 5000 for the get and 1000 for the hide show of the elements which should provide an extra 3000ms at least before the next call

8102039
onresume	onpause
add in your own onpause onstop onresume etc

8102056
versioning	upgrade
you might want to upgrade to the latest versioning 2.0 public or even the latest 2.1-level build from as you will get many reliability improvements and you will be able to push notifications with a single line of code instead of all these complicated steps

8102096
mouseup	mousedown
you should be able to dispatch a mousedown event with the subject element as the event target and it should stay active until a matching mouseup event is dispatched

8102110
width	height
i checked the position of child control in new parent left and top and width and height no problem

8102117
implements	extends
you can certainly implements these attributes yourself just as you would extends any class with a facade

8102149
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable iqueryable or list

8102160
ilist	icollection
if there are to be no further queries and all the data will need to be read return an ilist icollection etc

8102197
width	height
when the user is finished with their caption and would like to submit i need a way to insert the width height and position left and right attributes into my database

8102205
for-loop	loops
your while loops terminates as count increases past mycnt and anoter iteration of for-loop is executed

8102215
hide	show
i can t put all the data into one table because each table represents a different category of information and is inside a custom control with a collection of collapsible panels so you can show or hide each category separately

8102218
accessor	properties
instead of creating a virtual static variable just create a regular properties that returns a sprite based on the type of the class switch on this.gettype .tostring in the get accessor

8102231
ienumerable	icollection
if the answer is not very i d just return icollection or even arrays if you want to prevent the query results from being inadvertently modified. in a pinch if you ever need to change a query to stream results with a custom ienumerable you can always have the old method call the new one and materialise the results to keep compatibility with older clients

8102233
quicksort	mergesort
insertion sort is simple and for small lists it is generally faster than a comparably implemented quicksort or mergesort

8102251
udp	tcp
udp is connectionless protocol server just needs to start listening on udp port and client can send data datagram immediately there is no need for connection establishment with connect accept like in tcp

8102272
opengl-es	glsurfaceview
i know that i can use opengl-es the ndk or an glsurfaceview but i would like to know from the community

8102336
free	malloc
if you don t want memory leak you have to free the memory from malloc

8102406
debian	linux
i am using debian flavor linux system

8102413
pop-up	dialog
a dialog box called application pool identity will pop-up

8102413
folder	directory
network service must be granted both read and write permissions to the app_data folder located within your web project s directory

8102447
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox google-chrome and safari do things a little smarter differently

8102513
execvp	fork
the simple program i threw together to test with does not have the issues you are experiencing so i ll just go over the core of it around the fork execvp area with some error checking omitted for brevity

8102513
stdout	stderr
the above is the core of a very basic server only one client at a time that when it receives a connection forks a new process to run a command and sends its stderr and stdout to the client over the socket

8102544
pull	push
wicket is written so that you do not have to go pull data from a form submission and push it yourself onto your pojos

8102546
portrait	landscape
i am trying to programmatically select a tab when the orientation changes so that when the user changes from portrait to landscape for example the active tab remains the same

8102546
onresume	onpause
the issue also happens whether i use onstop onstart or onpause onresume for saving and restoring the active tab respectively

8102550
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
is it possible to extract image of uisegmentedcontrol from app so that i can use custom uibutton with this image as background

8102569
onresize	onscroll
utilising a jquery the solution i ended up with involved creating an onscroll and onresize for window resizing event listener that ran a check through all and checked their on the page

8102575
struts	wicket
the alternatives i m considering are struts wicket but frankly i editing big xlm files is painful

8102618
lisp	scheme
in the same way that a function is defined function-name in lisp scheme or there are do..end blocks in ruby the syntax of a java main function is with string args

8102674
stateless	stateful
why do they call webserver as stateless and database as stateful

8102731
stateless	stateful
networked filesystems might also be stateless earlier versions of nfs or stateful newer versions of nfs

8102734
free	malloc
note that since initqueue does not malloc its counterpart function emptyqueue should not free

8102751
folder	directory
i am working with an site where i have to store four images of different formats by creating a directory in an specified folder

8102781
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
if i was doing this in c i d just do a double for-loop that loops through an arrays doing arr i width + j arr of j+1 j-1 i+i i-1 the neighbors and have several different arrays that i d do the same thing for different qualities of the map i d be changing

8102867
put	get
user can insert new data using put command followed by id number and data value and retrieve data using get command followed by id

8102880
integer	unsigned
where nrows and ncols are integer constants and lc4uint is simply a typedef to unsigned int

8102909
min	max
is there a way in a single sql statement to grab the max temp_hi and it s id and get the min temp_lo and it s id

8102933
nsstring	nsdata
if you really want to use it first you ll have to read your whole file or a large chunk into an nsstring or an nsdata and then convert that to nsstring

8102941
min	max
there could be more than an id with max and min temperature so i just pick one

8102975
post	get
what i need to do is cancel current post calls and just get the last callback

8102990
portrait	landscape
please go through this link iphone sdk orientation landscape and portrait views i think you are not putting your code in orientation changing method

8103000
folder	directory
for example in my .vim bundle directory it has two new folder delimitmate and colorschemes

8103026
implements	extends
i have public class experimentallinoneactivity extends activity implements onclicklistener on each button click listener i want to go some other class like public class temperaturestrategy and perform all logic calculation in this class but main thing is that i have class like public class dialogdisplay extends dialog implements onitemselectedlistener in this class a custom dialog is created

8103058
onresume	onpause
perhaps you can call onpause in the onresume called only after the screen turns on and call and onresume when your activity has focus again

8103085
querypath	phpquery
you can use domdocument or one of the simpler library frontends like phpquery or querypath

8103092
gson	jackson
i highly recommend abandoning gson in favor of jackson whenever possible.

8103162
width	height
you can define more layouts with different width and height.then check the height and width and density of device and use that specific layout for that device

8103194
width	height
for most width and sometimes height problems you can use layout_weight to assign the exact ratio catered for each view

8103197
getter	setter
i think you should consider data transfer objects dtos which would have public getter setter just to transfer the serialized object data

8103219
width	height
i have a string like this now how can i change the values of width height etc using javascript.there may be a n after or before the properties width height etc

8103275
emacs	aquamacs
i really like the xcode dusk color theme and i was trying to get something similar for my aquamacs emacs

8103297
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass and a subclassing

8103297
superclass	subclassing
i am supposed to do an assignment where i execute a method from the subclassing which overrides the method from the superclass

8103297
superclass	subclassing
however when i declare the type to be of the superclass it does not recognize any of the subclassing s methods to even exist

8103299
viewdidload	viewwillappear
uitableviewcontroller reloads the table view s data in viewwillappear not viewdidload

8103359
pop-up	dialog
anyway what happens is that the dialog pop-up the user provides the login info but then it redirects to a blank screen

8103359
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested on google-chrome firefox safari and opera

8103393
subtract	add
i know in java it s possible to take a char and add or subtract from it to change the char which was an extremely simple method

8103414
int	double
in vararg functions such as printf int smaller than int are promoted to int and floats smaller than double are promoted to double

8103416
stdout	stderr
it s more complicated than this -- the behavior changes if the file descriptor in question is being used for stdout or stderr or another file

8103446
uipangesturerecognizer	uipinchgesturerecognizer
note after the first comment i have added two more recognizers to the sprite uipinchgesturerecognizer and uipangesturerecognizer

8103592
profiling	benchmarking
of course the only way to deal with all performance issues is to benchmarking and profiling

8103599
hide	show
in my experience i have implement 4 uiwebview that load amount of xml data and convert to html with objective-c code and use javascript to manage each pages with javascript that hide show document.getelementbyid

8103639
oncreate	findviewbyid
in activity oncreate i call findviewbyid on a few resources to configure them everything works fine on first load

8103639
oncreate	findviewbyid
when oncreate is called due to an orientation change findviewbyid returns null for all these resources

8103653
bindparam	bindvalue
but i can t override the bindparam and bindvalue methods

8103653
bindparam	bindvalue
then i replaced the pdo param_str to null in the parameter list of bindparam bindvalue so i got

8103653
bindparam	pdostatement
strict standards declaration of dbstatement bindparam should be compatible with that of pdostatement bindparam

8103653
bindparam	pdostatement
strict standards declaration of dbstatement bindparam should be compatible with that of pdostatement bindparam in d www pdotest.php on line 73

8103655
put	get
you can put that code anywhere else but it at least has to be somewhere or else you ll get a linker error during building

the subtle difference with instead of piping is mainly that the while loops would execute in a subshell due the pipe and the variable in the for-loop would not actually be updated because of the subshell

8108392
folder	directory
so i placed my dlls including the tessdata folder in the same directory and deleted the dlls from system32

8108394
google-chrome	firefox
if you have google-chrome or firefox you have many add ons that will help you with seo

8108427
getter	setter
this is related to getter and setter

8108427
getter	setter
from the code it could be either the setter or the getter

8108427
getter	setter
it does seem to be something that is called when the getter or setter is used not defined

8108427
getter	setter
also please pay attention to getter and setter rules

8108427
getter	setter
a getter must have at least as much visibility as the setter ie public if the setter is public etc

8108427
getter	setter
and since we are talking about a compiler bug here i d avoid weird visibilities ie anything not public or private inheritance or mixed visibilities eg setter private and getter public

8108427
getter	setter
so it is related to a getter or setter which is defined in a trait and used on a class or used on a trait

8108427
getter	setter
do you have overload getter setter for lazy vals or getter setter being overloaded with lazy vals

8108509
ubuntu	linux
iâ m a completely newbie and i like to know which environment can you recommend me for programming in c++ i mean operating system if linux ubuntu is a right option

8108511

i am tagging this as haml since i am guessing haml will have the same issue when using coffeescript

8108512
maven	pom.xml
i want to migrate from maven 2 to maven 3 on windows and i was wondering what are the necessary steps to migrate beside adding an environment variable for the maven 3 are there any changes in pom.xml file

8108520
int	chars
because i want to use the strings and int in that line with .next .nextint how can i break the while loop after reading one line or how can i break the while loop with entering newline chars

opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the page shows normally on pc every browser and on mac osx safari opera google-chrome and on some osx with firefox

8108586
width	height
in the following some of the width and height can probably be replaced by wrap_content

8108597
nsstring	nsdata
that means staying with nsdata the whole way through and not at any point trying to convert it into or interpret it as text for an nsstring

8108646
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you could write a firefox plugin google-chrome safari extension to do that

8108655
getter	setter
more complicated getter and setter from within a class

8108683
fseek	fread
you can use the skip option of the fread function as well as fseek to read the records one column at-a-time

8108688
min	max
in fact implementing len max min as a built-in function is actually less code than implementing them as methods for each type

8108719
folder	directory
if you run android.bat from command-line with update sdk arguments it will run all items from a temp directory and not lock the tools folder

8108819
textarea	textbox
on the textarea textbox

8108823
hash	salt
the security class uses the sha1 scheme by default and cakephp also uses a salt which you set in your config.php to generate an even more unique hash

8108830
post	get
according to the samples i ve seen as well as the nice post by jeremy north at i should get what i need from the show method of my iotadebuggervisualizerexternalviewer implementation

8108834
execvp	fork
a job is started by calling fork and then calling execvp with the proper arguments

8108859
hide	show
so i think the flicker comes from this the animation reaches 0px which means sudden fullresize in chrome as show in the above jsfiddle and then the element hide

8108898
free	malloc
memory that is allocated by malloc for example and that is not free

8108912
do-while	break
expression statement do-while statement continue statement break

8108934
free	malloc
that claim about malloc and free is correct for all modern computing operating systems

8108946
button	checkbox
i already have the code for the checkbox and button

8108953
post	get
since you want the app to be able to post to your wall you ll need it to ask you for the publish_stream permission in within the scope but since you ve managed to get your app posting to its own wall as itself you ve probably figured that part out already

8108960
overwrite	preserve
then you would have preserve the old object and created a new object with any properties from the old object if they aren t present in the new object and overwrite any existing properties with the properties from the new data from the server

8108966
uninstall	upgrade
you should be able to uninstall the old products by authoring a major upgrade using the upgrade table

8108991
codeigniter	kohana
what you seem to want is a folder structure like kohana 2 codeigniter and most likely other frameworks which have dedicated folders for controllers models and views

8108992
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if that s the case is viewdidload or viewwillappear the common places to load the data for the viewcontroller

8109006
children	parent
once you delete that parent key you ll orphan the children and won t have access to them anymore

8109008
button	checkbox	hide	show
if you want to prevent the user to find the i agree checkbox and submit button right way you will have to hide it and then show these inputs once he read the last page

8109008
button	checkbox
this loads the terms as you scroll the page and at the last one it adds a checkbox and submit button

8109008
button	checkbox
make sure the page is long enough so you have to scroll and also use the .live event because the checkbox and input button don t exists when you load the page

8109094
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m currently building a site which looks very well in safari but many elements are out of place in other browsers ie google-chrome chromium canary regular firefox

8109094
google-chrome	firefox
i can probably put conditional comments for ie but what of google-chrome and firefox

8109096
int	double
i don t think there s significant improvement performing int arithmetic using matlab s interpreter using int data types might actually be slower because matlab s functions are optimized for double

8109157
google-chrome	firefox
i m getting the following error message in google-chrome and firefox while trying to implement gorbachev s syntax highlighter

8109159
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the longer version is that i m building a fullscreen extension for google-chrome that works the same as firefox and safari on pc

8109171
width	height
i m sorry for answering my own question but the answer is use a flow layout with a script that calculates the space to the bottom of the screen using percentages calculated by the current width and height of the window to calculate the height of the content and or footer div

8109181
daemons	systemd
you can run size geoip_server.o to make sure that the bss uninitialized static data is the same for the 2 daemons on each systemd

8109188
public	protected
default modifier in other words no modifier not public not private and not protected

8109194
viewdidload	viewwillappear
and then of course you have viewdidload and viewwillappear

8109202
firefox	safari
please test it in firefox safari

8109255
post	get
therefore cookies can easily be manipulated and should only be trusted in the same way that you trust post or get data

8109286
bash	zsh
you might try using zsh instead of bash

8109300
pull	push
i had a similar problem although with all internet and not just push pull of git

8109355
post	get
client does a get on the header location but post data is gone meaning the form cannot be repopulated

8109378
sudo	passwd
this solution here says to use sudo whoami and then rvmsudo because it will remember your passwd for 5 minutes but my passwd is not remembered

8109381
free	malloc	implements	extends
just implements a regular memory manager with malloc and free equivalents and extends it to support extra control data your process ids

8109412
innodb	myisam
i m not db expert clearly and from researching have become warry of running innodb at the same time as myisam replication backup implications

8109412
innodb	myisam
but it does seem like splitting the product table to house main information innodb and the fulltext descriptions myisam seperately may help dramatically

8109507
google-chrome	safari
the problem occurs for me only in safari google-chrome is ok and only on certain machines reproducible on macbook pros 15 with non-retina displays but not on imacs and retina display machines

8109521
int	boolean
typically semaphores are boolean but they can be int for example if you want to allow a specific number of threads to enter the region at any time

8109532
int	chars
i mean i am seeing people use bytes int chars

8109552
for-loop	loops
of course you can shove multiple statements in a for-loop initialisation or final-expression by separating them with commas but if that is anything more complicated than i++ j++ k-- it quickly gets too messy for my taste and a while loops would be a better choice

8109559
boost	stl
i had this same problem the short answer to your question it s not possible with the standard stl libraries although it is possible with boost phoenix

8109604
textview	imageview
inside it put an imageview and a textview

8109639
width	height
another alternative could be to make a #container with the overall height width 400px then set the .divs to be height width 50

8109699
rss	feed
i am using domdocument to call an rss feed

8109727
post	put
you can replace the method with post delete put for profile editing

8109744
calloc	malloc
malloc will not initialise the memory but calloc will as mentioned by prasoon saurav

8109754
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for some reason it seems to work in firefox and google-chrome but the slider is broken in safari

8109762
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
i was wondering why is it required to create a new bufferedoutputstream when we create a new dataoutputstream

8109762
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
i ve modified the 2 lines of code output and input taking away the bufferedoutputstream and bufferedinputstream and everything seems to work just fine so i was wondering what is the purpose of the bufferedoutputstream and bufferedinputstream

8109832
folder	directory
note that this images folder is located inside whatever directory contains your executable

8109884
folder	directory
then i copied this file privatekey.store from my user directory over to my project folder and did the following changes in my code

8109902
atoi	atof
then you can use atoi atof etc

8109905
put	get
i put in my api key but the problem is whenever i call this method i get

8109973
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
note i have tested the above cookie script in firefox google-chrome safari and opera and all work fine

8109973
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie 8

8110012
realloc	malloc
make yourself familiar with malloc and realloc - here is some kind of example small tutorial

8110024
integer	fractions
you are using int s for currentsize and totalsize which results in integer division which removes the fractions part yielding 0

8110028
integer	fractions
if currentsize and totalsize are integers this calculation will do integer division which will truncate your fractions down to 0

8110053
sdl	glew
for the record i am using visual c++ 2010 express glew 1.7.0 and the latest sdl 1.3 revision

8110087
folder	directory
i think the problem is that the directory cache and fonts of tcpdf residing in the folder which path is stored in the constant k_path_main by default this is the tcpdf-directory are not writeable by your webserver

8110118
int	double
therefore i cast one int operand to double

8110118
int	double
after the calculation if you want the result to store in int you have to cast convert double to int

8110142
ubuntu	linux
i m using the latest v0.6.1 running on ubuntu linux

8110145
allocator	stl
allocator at least pre-c++11 were something of a late addition to the stl

8110157
realloc	malloc
implement your resizable array using malloc and realloc

8110189
unix	solaris
there is no library i m aware of but implementing it would be quite straightforward under solaris and all unix unix like oses supporting tmpfs and mmap

8110202
hash	salt
you can use something like sha-256 but you should also salt the password before hashing it and you can iteratively hash the password - so in the unlikely event it is cracked it will only reveal another hash in other words cracking the password takes much longer

8110235
width	height
get the real width and height of an image with javascript

8110235
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome

8110235
width	height
these two sources help fix the jquery get image height or width returns 0 problem which was the initial problem

8110251
implements	extends
java will not allow me to extends from bytebuffer because it implements abstract methods that i am not overriding yet these methods work for any bytebuffer objects that are created such as asdoublebuffer .

8110251
implements	extends
yet if i extends a new class from bytebuffer it forces me to implements asdoublebuffer even though the superclass already implements this method obviously since i can call it just fine

8110270
textview	imageview
i have a complex row layout 2 imageview 3 textview so i have defined my own adapter

8110280
concave	convex
as you see it is neither convex hull nor concave hull

8110300
crypt	salt
also use a varying salt for each call to crypt

8110300
crypt	salt
to call crypt with the blowfish algorithm use a salt that begins with followed by a number the cost parameter between 04 and 31 followed by a and then 22 digits from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z

8110301
folder	directory
if that is the case then the easiest route would be to simply create a new workspace whose root directory will actually be the htdocs folder

8110338
hash	salt
say i hash passwords with standardpasswordencoder which uses sha-256 and 8bit random characters as a salt and save it to db for registration form for example

8110338
hash	salt
and even if it knows how will it find out what salt to apply to get same hash

8110349
equals	tostring
tostring equals and hashcode method creation

8110406
hex	binary
the exception is for hex numbers that can be formed by two groups 4 binary numbers 2 4 16

8110406
hex	binary
1110 binary would be 14 decimal and equivalent of e hex

8110417
post	get
the method is a get instead of post

8110418
division	modulo
so if you do modulo and integer division in a loop stopping when x 0 you can output a number in any base

8110443
g++	gcc
please enable all warnings and debugging for your compiler with g++ -wall -g if using gcc and improve your code till you get no warning

8110464
hex	binary
to convert 1101000 into hexadecimal we can use a little trick very similar to your attempt to use 10 and 4 to build the hex version from the binary version without much work -- look at groups of four bits at a time

8110477
udp	tcp
if you start from scratch - you know nothing about the lan - and you want to find every possible service you have to scan almost all the tcp and udp ports for every possible host

8110477
min	max
this is the most efficient way both max speed and min network bandwidth

8110477
packets	multicast
your pc nic in promiscous mode doesn t receive all the traffic on the network because the switch forwards to you only the packets for your host or for all broadcast and - if registered - multicast

8110477
winpcap	libpcap
libpcap winpcap is the de facto standard to capture packets and it works

8110482
vim	emacs
you could also use gnu emacs instead of vim

8110560
hash	md5
for a concrete example of why using plain unsalted md5 for password hashing is a bad idea try entering the md5 hash of some reasonably common passwords into a site like md5decrypter.co.uk or md5hashcracker.appspot.com or md5this.com

8110603
prepare	execute
you can have cached prepare statements and after each execute clear parameters

8110662
int	chars
use explicit cast to convert int to chars

8110738
udp	tcp
i m going to use the udp protocol as it is faster than tcp

8110738
udp	tcp
i like the kryonet api its very clean code however it appears to only allow running of servers on both tcp and udp when i only want a server running on udp

8110748
mailgun	cloudmailin
yes check out the add-on link for cloudmailin mailgun and sendgrid

8110761
for-loop	loops
i thought of an alternative but not yet tried vaz i wanna the way out this way only using a for-loop instead of while loops that might work.

8110762
udp	tcp
i don t think you should make the assumption that udp is faster than tcp

8110783
entities	entitymanager
you should never use the entitymanager inside your entities

8110818
button	checkbox
you could bind the toggle event without the onclick with something like adding a selectall class for the checkbox button

8110853
inherited	properties
the fileinfo and directoryinfo classes both inherited the non-abstract attribute properties from the abstract filesysteminfo class

8110864
post	get
reading these helpful tips and some other post about setting the android device i wrote down a step by step tutorial how to get the device ready

8110864
ubuntu	centos	redhat	fedora
ubuntu redhat fedora centos

8110925
entity-relationship	diagram
not sure if they do entity-relationship diagram syntax though

8110981
post	get
what i d like to know is why every post i read says there is very few places you would typically pass a ref i know the examples are contrived but i hope you get the idea when it seems to me that the ref example is smaller cleaner and more exact

8110982
hide	show
both the hidden show hidden files... and hidefileext hide file extension reverted back to their previous values as soon as i opened the view tab in folder settings

8110984
google-chrome	firefox
but this only supported by gecko firefox google-chrome and internet explorer 10+

8110991
setinterval	settimeout
what you want to do instead is use the settimeout or setinterval functions both methods of the window object

8110991
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
both settimeout and setinterval return an id that is essentially a reference to the timer that has been set which you can use with cleartimeout and clearinterval to cancel any queued execution that hasn t happened yet so another way to implement your function is as follows

8111013
post	get
i have checked with firebug and found that the post to jqpost.php is showing a loading icon and at the same time the get request made by poll is also showing the loading icon

8111042
postgresql	mysql
if i change to postgresql do i have to change a lot of syntax or can i do that hierarchical stuff in mysql itself

why in the case of subtraction eax register need to be used and not in the case of addition

8111206
width	height
make layout width and height as fill_parent

8111208
inherited	properties
as you don t want to turn proxycreation off you are stuck dynamicproxy objects wherever you put virtual keyword for object properties ef context inherited your object and replaces virtual properties with dynamicproxy objects

8111208
inherited	properties
these dynamicproxy objects do not inherited from your poco entities they just have same properties and can be used instead of your poco

8111226
subtraction	addition
i m guessing because addition is commutative a + b b + a whereas subtraction is not a - b

8111260
coalesce	isnull
if it is possible i would advise to modify stored procedure and or sql call for this procedure and insert missing data with help of partial joins left right join and coalesce isnull functions

8111271
width	height
so i have to find the width depth height values first

8111289
width	height
it s much more easier to use a view for example instead and set it s layout width and height and add custom background

8111290
serializable	deserialization
edit could the problem be that the deserialization fails because i serializable the events to

8111300
min	max
firstly the omission of min-heaps in the discussion probably isn t a typo it doesn t really matter if we re talking about a min heap or a max heap the comparator is just reversed

8111313
width	height
assuming you have width 80 depth 39 height 190 in an element ie

8111322
xlib	gdk
alternatively you could use clutter-gtk and the gdk api instead of using xlib directly

8111339
width	height
i have an rgb image matrix height width 3 represented in doubles

8111415
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu when i invoke the script via bash it works as expected but in windows when i invoke the script via powershell it behaves weirdly check p.s

8111415
ubuntu	linux
same erratic behaviour takes place with the changes and in linux ubuntu behaviour again is as expected

8111448
int	chars
use bytes int chars

8111451
post	get
you ll need to post explain plan and probably you ll have to answer further questions if you want to get help on that

8111486
post	get
if you still have problems try looking in to this issues with passing cookies to get request after post

8111489
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in google-chrome and firefox but causes an error error access is denied. in ie

8111489
google-chrome	firefox
the success function is called in google-chrome and firefox but the error function is called in ie with the above message

8111489
google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome and firefox both locally and on my server it works in ie locally but not on the server

8111505
int	chars
it can any integral type int chars signed chars unsigned int and so on

8111522
folder	directory
the images folder should be resided in your project root directory

8111531
public	protected
in your code behind file expose the timer as a public protected or private member or field

8111546
google-chrome	firefox
here s a simple bespoke example that works with es5-compliant browsers or libraries that emulate es5 behavior live copy run in google-chrome or firefox or similar but look after the example for a more generalized solution

8111549
super	self
instance variable used while self is not set to the result of super or self init...

8111584
portrait	landscape
it works fine in portrait mode but in landscape it scales everything even the png and it looses resolution

debian	linux
i m not going to open a war saying it s like moving from windows to linux or a mac or even moving from debian to red hat but the structures and systems are different so they have different concepts strengths limitations and purposes

8111773
mouseover	mouseout
if you move from one child to another child of #gifts then you have a mouseout and mouseover that get triggered

8111773
mouseover	mouseout
what you should probably do is implement a timeout of 200ms for example for the mouseout and clear that timeout if it exists when a mouseover is called

8111773
mouseover	mouseout
that way the mouseout will take .2s to trigger - plenty of time for the next mouseover event to trigger

8111775
profiling	instrumentation
this gives you a chance to run instrumentation and do a bit of memory profiling and allocation tracking

8111800
folder	directory
i am used to create a folder called work and put images sounds etc there and configure the working directory to use this folder

8111819

8111992
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
input is automatically detected as bmp png gif or jpg output is always jpg

8111993
sudo	passwd
you need a sudo configuration line which allows for the command to be executed by the user without passwd prompt

8112118
jboss	glassfish
so far most app servers i looked at glassfish jboss are all controlled from the os instead of being able to integrate into an existing java application

8112138
width	font-size
after experimenting with it i found that the font-size property seems to affect the width of the but i m not sure why or how to correct it

8112140
int	chars
however my new implementation includes making everything a chars and then converting the int when they need to be used

8112193
int	chars
and scanning for d will attempt to get an int not a chars

8112251
division	multiplication
that shows the multiplication happening first leading to integer overflow rather than the division which would end up with a multiplication of 1

for-loop	loops
both loops are essentially identical with the only difference being - with an ordinary for-loop you have an index which you might need depending on what type of data you are accessing and whether you need to do some calculations with the index and there is probably an increased chance of off-by-one errors

8116707
superclass	subclassing
you ve overridden everything about superclass in your subclassing and instead having job_select be an instance of different subclassing depending on the job_type and using method resolution to call the right code job_select is always a superclass which contains an option1 or option2 and explicitly delegates to it

8116729
for-loop	loops
in a nutshell each loops of the for-loop is referring to the same variable i so the compiler uses the same lambda expression for all loops

8131658
put	get
when it comes to recognizing sounds - it can also get arbitrarily complex but a clapper might be a simple task - you basically want to detect a sudden increase in volume which would manifest in a sharp short-term increase of the moving-average of absolute values in the stream so i d put a sliding windows on the stream and keep checking with certain thresholds - one short window for the high volume threshold and two adjacent longer and lower threshold windows to make sure there was no such noise before and after the clapper

8133582
comparator	comparable
see the comparable interface or comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals. this is so because the set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation but a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its comparator or compare method so two elements that are deemed equals by this method are from the standpoint of the sorted set equals

8133590
skip-lists	tree
if you go towards writing your own skip-lists tree to make the reordering of an item into a single - and hopefully faster - op then you might also go this lock-free route too

generally they re equivalent in objective-c 2.0 environment but the debugger for example won t see the generated ivar as this object s member in the variables view and you ll have to ask for the value by using gdb s command line po command using the accessor method not the short-form dot notation though

hide	show
this way you can easily show hide views with button clicks and still utilize binding mechanism

8157219
fadein	fadeout
use fadein and fadeout methods

8157224
udp	tcp
i ve seen multiple times now where someone pointed out issues that can occur when using udp and tcp simultaneously

8157224
udp	tcp
it seems to me that it would be ideal to use a combination of udp and tcp gaining the advantages of each

8157238
fadein	fadeout
jquery fadein and fadeout does just that

8157246
content-length	content-type
if you do a head request you will usually be able to get some basic metadata on the file in question in the form of the content-type and content-length headers returned by the server but this is typically limited to the mime type and the file size and if you re dealing with a script that serves the file and that script doesn t set the necessary headers you might not even get that

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in the jsfiddle below why does firefox rotate the container differently than google-chrome or safari

8157400
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari the container rotates gradually whereas in firefox the container rotates immediately

8157408
udp	tcp
the first possible issue i can think of is that because udp doesn t have the overhead inherent in the transmission control that tcp does udp has higher data bandwidth and lower latency

8157408
udp	tcp
so it is possible for a udp datagram that was sent after a tcp message to be available on the remote computer s input buffers before the tcp message is received in full

8157408
udp	tcp
this may cause problems if you use tcp to control or monitor udp transmission

8157408
udp	tcp
for instance you might tell the server via tcp that you ll be sending some datagrams via udp on port x

8157428
udp	tcp
if you already have a tcp or udp server the easiest way will probably be to switch to unix domain sockets

8157428
udp	tcp
they come in stream and datagram modes just like tcp udp sockets and they re always local as they use the filesystem namespace instead of port numbers like tcp udp

8157440
folder	directory
if i look the project with the directory perspective i see the files below bin folder

8157525
pthreads	usleep
usleep is not part of the c standard but of an ancient pthreads standard but see below

8157525
pthreads	usleep
no the pthreads specification of usleep clearly states

8157525
pthreads	usleep
as already be mentioned by others the pthreads function nanosleep is now replacing usleep and you should use that

8157552
integer	fractions
ulong is an integer type and can never have any precision for fractions decimal values

8157585

please do not recommend to use int 11 instead of chars 20 for memberid i can t change it it contains exactly 20 symbols

8157586
freeglut	glew
my system s default version for opengl and glsl using freeglut is 4.1 also using glew there is no problem with its initialization shader compilation and linking and execution

width	margin
the width value must be the exactly size you want for your content box and the margin property just centralize it no matter the size of the monitor

8157809
int	chars
i was having problems converting a chars array like 7c7c7d7d7d7d7c7c7c7d7d7d7d7c7c7c7c7c7c7d7d7c7c7c7c7d7c7d7d7d7c7c2e2e2e into its actual int value that would be able to be represented by 7c as one hexadecimal value

8157809
int	chars
this separates the chars string into its right int and may be helpful to more people than just me

8157841
put	get
my get requests work just fine but i can t seem to get put requests to work

8158148
folder	directory
clickoncemore will allow you to add all the files in one directory to your clickonce manifests by adding a single folder include

8158168
post	get
this has a very similar effect in that the image does get to the user s gallery and ends up on their wall but if you post multiple images they all go side by side rather than in a list

8158205
public	protected
a class c inherits from its direct superclass and direct superinterfaces all non-private methods whether abstract or not of the superclass and superinterfaces that are public protected or declared with default access in the same package as c and are neither overridden â 8.4.8.1 nor hidden â 8.4.8.2 by a declaration in the class

8158229
width	height
have you tried height auto and width auto as well as using max-height and max-width this usually results in ie rendering the correct aspect ratio

8158252
accessor	properties
you can use the retained properties accessor which will release retain automatically

you can restrict dates by placing a max min

8158738
hide	show
i ve also tried setting opacity 1 or 0 rather than using jquery show hide with the same result

8158738
google-chrome	safari
even stranger this happens on both google-chrome and safari

8158761
inherited	properties
but the case is that the properties from the debug and release properties sheets are inherited to the project properties

8158761
inherited	properties
and you cannot modify the inherited properties from the project properties

i need to sort a directory of several thousand files into a handful of folder based on a type specified in a csv file

8158894

try giving your canvas a set width and height and give it a background color transparent should be fine and see if that helps you get your mouse events

8158916
oncreate	setcontentview
i was having this problem too until i realized that i had specified the wrong layout in setcontentview of the oncreate method of the fragmentactivity

use uipangesturerecognizer dragging and uiswipegesturerecognizer to keep track of when your user touches the rotating element

8159042
tolower	toupper
however i think this solution assumes that the code is doing a toupper instead of tolower before string comparison therefore it may be broken if datatable code is modified in the future

8159042
tolower	toupper
turkish i problem in turkish toupper i ä tolower i ä

draggable	droppable
i m implementing the jquery draggable plugin as well as the metadata plugin but am struggling with accessing the metadata from the callback function of the droppable

8159065
draggable	droppable
i can access the metadata outside of the draggable droppable functions and it works fine

8159065
draggable	droppable
however if i add the following before the draggable droppable code it works

8159145
listview	gridview
i noticed you put listview gridview datagrid as a tag

8159183
ant	maven
your ide ant and maven should all support this

8159185
floating-point	integer
i m writing a library with structures of varying precision level such as a point with integer coordinates and a point with floating-point coordinates

8159194
post	get
you really don t want to be passing arbitrary js through the get or post to be executed on the page

8159241
int	double
i think of nested classes as implementation details of the containing class and a point with double fields is not an implementation detail of a point with int fields

8159281
put	get
so as a starter what you can do is just get your own coordinates and put a marker on your location on the map

8159284
client-side	server-side
you re confusing server-side and client-side scripting

8159321
int	chars
the whole url in this case is 966 chars long after research it seems that the maxquerystringlength value is 2048 by default but can overridden to any value of type int so just for grins i added the

apache	nginx
i m seriously considering the switch from apache to nginx and i d like to understand nginx better - i m no apache guru either so i think i ll learn more about apache in the answers to these questions

make the width and height of the embedded code 100

8159453
mouseover	mouseout
i am using mouseover mouseout and click to highlight rows on mouseover and add a highlight class on click

8159480
tax	shipping
so products shipping costs and all that are always displayed with tax

8159521
keydown	keyup
if you need to use the nicedit then you can limit the keystrokes by binding the keyup keydown event to the newly created div it doesnt replace your textarea - its adds a div and hides your textarea

8159573
hide	show
simple javascript show hide content

8159577

i fear this post may get closed as off-topic

8159637
range	min
support screens is a min filter where as compatible screens is a range filter

8159669
nsdocument	nsfilecoordinator
just shared this on twitter with you but i believe when using nsdocument you don t need to do any of the nsfilecoordinator stuff - just make the document ubiquitous and save

8159700
fadein	fadeout
fyi - in that fiddle i also updated your fadein and fadeout functions before you had

8159700
fadein	fadeout
the reason i did that is because animations happen asychronously so you were calling fadeout but while it was fading out you were then calling fadein which caused some weirdness is what was displayed and when

8159730
folder	directory
because the folder externals exists in neither project after i update proa and the externals are added proa dirb externals prod is an unversioned directory

8159758
titlebar	window
if you create the child window to cover the parent make the child window borderless but leave the parent s titlebar exposed â that should do what you re looking for

8159761
maven	pom.xml
if it s a maven project check it out of source control run mvn eclipse eclipse and it should work in eclipse if it doesn t your pom.xml needs work

8159784

8159826
pop-up	dialog
there is a nice example in your apidemos folder which creates an activity that looks like a pop-up dialog

8159879
mdpi	hdpi
it appears to be using the mdpi version of the icon in both places even though hdpi and xhdpi versions of it are available but even one of those would look fuzzy next to the icons for the built-in gallery app book covers etc

8159915
try-catch	exception-handling
also it s a very bad practive to catch an instance of exception-handling - try catching only the respective checked exception-handling here - i.e filenotfoundexception or something -you can delete your try - catch clasuse and afterwards pres ctrl + 1 in eclipse while you have selected the row -- choose the surround with try-catch option and eclipse will auto-generate for you the appropriate catch clause and here i mean just the proper checked exception-handling to be handled not the catch clause body

8159917
width	height
in addition at the moment firefox requires that the svg element have width and height attributes in order to render to canvas

8159957
width	margin
if you use a width of 100 and also apply border padding or margin then your content will be larger than 100

8159957
width	margin
if you tell it to have a specific padding margin and border then the width will take up the rest of the space width auto

8159968
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome ie6 ie9 but in ie8 there appears to be a 2 pixel edge around the html page when the window in maximised or windowed

8160105
width	height
i have a html page with 100 x 200px width and height respectively

8160124
superclass	subclassing
but in order to declare that some class extends this protected class you first need to be able to see it from there which can t happen because it s visible only from the derived classes given that superclass and subclassing aren t in the same package

8160141
salt	md5
that md5 could be the username and a salt like sort of a password

8160160
servicecontract	webinvoke
i ve got the abstract interface defined via the servicecontract and the actual service logic exposed via the webinvoke keyword

8160201
hide	show
the below is what is in use to show hide a few of the fields depending on which radio button is checked further up the form this all works as expected

8160202
sorting	grouping
sorting the array in place before converting to a list might well be more efficient and you might look at removing dups from the sorted list manually as they will be grouping together

8160216
implements	extends
as the implements declarer but then i get a warning that a syntax error exists on extends

8160234
n-gram	words

xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
i have been beaten by this bug and i would like to work-around it by accessing getresponseheader method of original xmlhttprequest object and not the one provided in jqxhr which seems to use broken getallresponseheaders

8160351
maven	pom.xml
alternatively the id of the missing library to add to maven is com.google.code.findbugs jsr305 1.3.9 so the build configuration should be fixed by adding the following dependency to pom.xml in the appropriate place warning - i didn t test this

8160358

i always get that duration warning but when ffmpeg outputs to a .wav file and the sox command is run separately i can still get a wav from sox and convert that to mp3 manually

8160407
hide	show
i already tried jquery show hide but hidden forms were also sent i decided to form from templates

8160447
udp	tcp
many games use udp and tcp together

8160447
udp	tcp
bottom line is if data has to arrive at the client in any case position updates upgrades aso. you have to send it via tcp or you implement your own reliable protocol based on udp

8160447
udp	tcp
most firewalls do not drop udp or anything else but as with tcp any traffic that is not declared to be safe opening ports packet redirects aso. gets dropped

8160447
udp	tcp
i would suggest you read up the tcp and udp and udp-lite article up at wikipedia and then decide which ones you want to use for what

8160464
google-chrome	firefox
in that case you need to put it through the browsers window.domparser firefox google-chrome or activexobject ie

8160466
portrait	landscape
okay i m making a mobile web app but i only want some pages to be able to change orientation for example i want the homepage to always stay in portrait mode but i want some of the other pages to be able to flip into landscape mode is that possible

8160543
put	get
in any case you should be able to get the idea here how you could measure this and put real numbers to it

8160561
public	protected
top level classes cannot have protected scope only public or package

8160582
salt	md5
perhaps you only used md5 password to register then you read somewhere that was unsafe and added a salt

8160645
goto	break
a for-loop with a break by definition is like a while goto as so

8160724
accessor	properties
edit i ve added properties accessor make sure to read up on declared properties

8160739
google-chrome	safari
it all works fine on pc in ie google-chrome safari but the like button does not show when the website is accessed using safari on an iphone

8160741
google-chrome	firefox
each instance of an htmlunitdriver chromedriver and firefoxdriver is completely independent of every other instance in the case of firefox and google-chrome each instance has its own anonymous profile it uses

8160757
public	protected
if it is all of them then our class might as well be public because then we re saying that any class has the right to access our protected class

post	get
for the rest of the question you should post a little bit of code and you should also tell us exactly what return codes you get where

8160818
int	chars	unsigned	short
once you know the format for uncompressed audio you can cast a pointer to your nsdata bytes to the proper array or array of structures c type unsigned chars short int pair of short int etc.

8160867
uiview	subviews
but since layoutsubviews is a uiview method not a uiviewcontroller method i would have to expose all my subviews to the view so i could identify them and set the layout

8160937
min	max
yes for visualization purposes just map min eigenface to 0 and max eigenface to 255

8160941

the answer is that internet explorer always chops long urls but firefox and google-chrome don t

8161026
post	get
when a real issue happens you would have to use certain post production or profiling tools to get it fixed

8165986
fadein	fadeout
once the span is hidden with fadeout you need to make it show up again with a show or a fadein

8166003
public	protected
typea and typeb are kind of a list containers what do you think would be the motivation for such kind of relationship public inheritance + friends vs having x_ and size_ as protected attributes if direct access is required

8166008
unsigned	short
you really should use an unsigned short to avoid language quirks on the high bit

8166016
jobs	cron
i don t think you need any cron jobs either

8166017
gmail	hotmail
for example on the screenshot below you can tell it s outlook not gmail or hotmail by looking at its title

8166058
hide	show
so when hide the file you use the text input or whatelse to show the file to user

8166073
width	height
as you can see when the width and height of .window are adjusted everything resizes

8166090
children	parent
as a base class i created a class that does all the organization like having a list of children a parent a method to add a child and so on

8166109
children	parent
not a recent question but if i understand the op correctly he has classes that are children of a parent class which define the allocator deallocator and can all require specific alignment

8166116
public	protected
even if you make it protected or public the members of a template base class are not automatically visible in the derived class

8166161
google-chrome	firefox
i suggest adding statements to your logging and using the javascript development console of your browser google-chrome firefox this will show what goes over the wire perfectly a dn what is executed on the client and why it fails if it fails

8166245
fontfamily	font-size
the css fontfamily and font-size are displayed correct

8166245
google-chrome	firefox
tested with firefox 8.0 and google-chrome 15

getter	setter
i m trying to do some simple xml serialization with javabeans with an object having five getter setter properties and two getter

8166368
getter	setter
the resulting xml has only the five getter setter properties the two properties of type list haven t been encoded

8166372
inherited	properties
instead use the text-anchor properties its possible values are start middle end or inherited

8166441
jar	war
in order to communicate with the war we have created a bridge module jar

8166441
jar	war
point to note is the bridge jar uses some api exposed as jars which are present inside the web-inf lib directory of the external war

8166441
jar	war
at the time of bringing up jboss we get java.lang.noclassdeffounderror errors because the bridge jar is not able to find the api present in external war s web-inf lib

8166441
jar	war
is there a way to access the jars present inside web-inf lib of the external war from the bridge jar

8166464
width	height
taking the device width height and according to that you can manipulate

8166464
width	height
from these width and height you can crop and scale the images

8166469
versioning	upgrade
this is regardless of whatever versioning of service pack or hotfix you have installed since updates to visual studio should not necessarily force your application to have to upgrade as described here

8166469
versioning	upgrade
the other difficulty is that when you upgrade visual studio the runtime merge modules in your redistributable folder are also upgrade to those versioning

8166479
post	get
post your results and you will probably get further help

8166508
getter	setter
until now its fine but this static method named getdata needs some data from setter and getter

8166508
getter	setter
so now my question is can we make setter getter as static

8166542
getter	setter
getter and setter can be static if they get set static fields

8166564
getter	setter
yes getter setter can be made static based on your need

8166574
getter	setter
if your properties are static then getter and setter will also be static

8166583
width	height
specify your image s height and width attribute its dimensions

8166630
portrait	landscape
i used the native ui controls plugin of phonegap for my iphone app.my app works fine in portrait mode but in landscape no buttons is displayed in tabbar just a black bar is visible

8166632
getter	setter
getter and setter are just normal methods

8166647
getter	setter
you can t make getter and setter methods static if you use any attributes or properties that aren t static

8166651
implements	extends
i have made a searchresultadapter extends baseadapter implements filterable which works basically fine

8166678
gridview	sqldatasource
the gridview databind internally performs the sqldatasource databind and also refreshes the gridview

8166706
getter	setter
of course you can make getter and setter be static with appropriate static fields

8166708
jar	war
ejbs are not part of war but its own ejb jar but i supposed this should not be the problem

8166708
jboss	glassfish

this test fails roughly every 8 hours in ie but i have not seen it fail in firefox or google-chrome

8166789
google-chrome	firefox
it works flawlessly on firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

8166796
jar	manifest.mf
resolved it by creating a manifest.mf using the maven-ejb-plugin defined in the pom.xml of the bridge jar

8166849
bluetooth	usb
however some devices might support both simultaneously and i don t know how external keyboards usb bluetooth interact with this value

8166852
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i think you call - ibaction directionbutton method somewhere in your viewdidload or viewwillappear or like that methods

8166884
width	height
thus you will need to explicitly specify the sizes of your images either in the image width and height properties itself or via css

8166887
integer	unsigned
use integer or signed or unsigned when you need to do arithmetic on the values

8166895
mdpi	hdpi
i have tried re-sizing a png file to different dimensions and placing the image in the ldpi mdpi hdpi folders but the image still looks stretched squashed depending on the device

8166965
int	chars
note instead of chars if i write code to get int or float it prompts for values

8166974
unsigned	short
so you can cast to_ulong to unsigned short or better yet uint16_t with no worries about overflow or endianness

8166976
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian and also depends on the version

8166981
openssl	gnutls
speaking about usability personally i would prefer gnutls api but at the time openssl looks more preferable to use

when i run this code on my phone i get a force close i run it on my phone each time to avoid emulator issues also i am also try to make it work locally before i attempt to make it a remote file however if i change the location of the file to something i know does not exist it will catch it and pop-up the dialog box that i specified

8167257
int	chars
i want to convert number from chars format to 32 bit int int32_t but strtol returns long

8167337

note that if you are just dealing with punctuation you ll probably want to remove the words boundary parts of this regex or it won t work

8167354
filtering	grouping
i m trying to use grouping by in find method for my relational database i want to get the latest record with unique receiver_id out of result set filtering by user_id and below is my code

8167373
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
i don t get why you don t have observablefoo implementing inotifycollectionchanged inotifypropertychanged

8167382
folder	directory
it might be the problem where people don t realize that when vstudio runs your application it tries to find it s resources in the same directory as the compiled executable and not in the folder where the source files are

8167471
dlsym	dlopen
without using use dlclose dlerror dlopen dlsym

in order to do that i simply override the width and height of this

8167761
jobs	cron
actually you can manipulate the cron jobs as simple as text files

8167761
daemon	cron
the cron daemon saves the cronjobs for each user using the following structure

8167776
post	get
because the method is still catched by the catch all get rule even adding the post route won t prevent get requests to this method

8167804

google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox 6 but no luck in google-chrome using the latest stable version so maybe this isn t the right way to do it

8167926
portrait	landscape
if you want a different layout for your landscape and portrait views then android has a very elegant way to implement this

8167926
portrait	landscape
you can create a layout-land folder in your res folder and place a landscape version of your layout xml file in there with the same name as your portrait version eg main.xml

8167930
portrait	landscape
there two kind of orientation s landscape and portrait

8167932
udp	rtp
it sends an h246 aac stream data over rtp udp

8167959
post	get
first of all it s a best practice to have search forms use the http get method instead of post so the search results can be bookmarked linked indexed etc

8167967
portrait	landscape
i need a view that can display both in portrait and landscape.but when i load another view i only want it show in landscape

8167970

in fact i am not even sure that adding another row in the database will add another row to the db-aware grid push as opposed to pull

8168055
backgrounding	multitasking
more about backgrounding app states and multitasking

8168090
addition	multiplication
boolean operators have analogues in conventional arithmetic so one way of deciding what the precedence rules should be is to follow the rules for conventional arithmetic and is analogous to multiplication while or is analogous to addition hence and should have higher precedence than or

subtraction	multiplication
i cannot understand why the multiplication operator works but the subtraction operator doesn t

8168231
width	height
i tried mini-magick and g1nn13-image-science but in the first one i can t take the current images width and height and because of it i can t realize the cropping algorithm and the second one gives me an error when i try to require image_science no such file to load -- inline

8168231
width	height
i used fastimage gem for finding picture s current height and width and the method of minimagick gem image.shave

8168285
addition	multiplication
using addition and multiplication is a convenience feature for working with strings

8168313
outputstream	inputstream
does anyone have any good suggestions for creating a pipe object in java which is both an inputstream and and outputstream since java does not have multiple inheritance and both of the streams are abstract classes instead of interfaces

8168329
mdpi	hdpi
i ve read 10 articles yet still cant find any relation between ldpi mdpi hdpi and the actual dimensions in pixels

8168337

8168365
draggable	droppable
so i want a piece of code executed when a draggable is reverted because it wasn t dropped on a droppable

8168369
outputstream	inputstream
instead you can have a pipe object that encapsulates composition an inputstream for reading and an outputstream for writing

8168369
system.in	system.out
pretty much like you have system.in and system.out in the standard api

8168393
subtraction	add
there is no support for subtraction operator in case of strings but you can simply add one

8168393
multiplying	subtract
regarding operation you should be aware that this is not remove twice the string from a but remove result of 2 times the from a first multiplying the by 2 and then subtract from a

8168424
button	checkbox
in the right side you can see inputs and a and a checkbox and on hover a button

width	height
scale the image uniformly maintain the image s aspect ratio so that both dimensions width and height of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view

8168431
screens	mdpi
in medium-density mdpi screens which correspond to the original android phones physical pixels are identical to dp s

8168431
mdpi	hdpi
the conversion factor from hdpi to mdpi in this case is 1.5 so for a developer s purposes the device is 320x533 in dp s

8168471
hide	show
this will hide the error by default then show it only if needed

8168514
google-chrome	safari
much of this is specific to webkit safari and google-chrome so you may be limited in browser support

8168545
uilabel	uitextview
another easy solution is to just add a uilabel to your uitextview subview

8168549
nstextview	nsscrollview
you should look at apple s text system user interface layer programming guide specifically the section titled putting an nstextview object in an nsscrollview here

8168549
nstextview	nsscrollview
then you create and configure the nstextview to go in the nsscrollview finally you combine the pieces

what i have so far works in google-chrome and firefox but how can i make this compatible with ie

8168616
getter	setter
that is the bean getter and setter removed

8168626
width	height
as you have your background image on an anchor you could always put a span inside the anchor for the image this way you can control the width and height of the span which in turn will only show the portion of the image you want it to use

8168636
folder	directory
in particular i m setting a custom badge icon to the files contained in a specific directory through nsworkspace via â seticon forfile options and i d like those badges to be lost as soon as the files gets copied outside the folder

8168721
inherited	subclassing
of course you can have multiple subclassing which extends and inherited from mapactivity if you want

8168721
inherited	subclassing
creating multiple subclassing which inherited from mapactivity is like having lots of subclassing which are also inheriting from activity

8168751
pop-up	dialog
my problem is that the automatic update dialog pop-up when i start my application and there is a newer version on the server

8168775
mdpi	hdpi
sdk 1.5 did not support the drawable sub-folders hdpi mdpi sdpi for the different resolutions

8168844
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
the ldpi mdpi and hdpi refer to screens density which means how much pixels can fit into a single inch

8168844
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
also you have multiple screens size types small normal large xlarge and each one of them can be ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi xxhdpi nexus 10 or xxxhdpi

how to compute checksum md5 hash for array of such structs

8168867
pull	push
i am not even sure that adding another row in the database will add another row to the db aware grid push as opposed to pull

8168874
crossover	mutation
crossover evolution strategies just use mutation and are totally fine without crossover

8168878
getter	setter
but better would be to not do any business logic in setter and definitely also not in getter and use instead

8168904
getter	setter
something else to note about json results i ve noticed that when i have a serializable object being returned as a result if that object contains other complex objects with a getter setter that returns the embedded object i will often receive an empty result or no result

8168904
int	boolean	getter	setter
i often end up writing json wrapper objects to use for my json results with getter setter that only return java types string int boolean etc and not the embedded objects

8168904
getter	setter
i think that ve solved this using delegate getter setter but i ll have to go back and look at some old code

8168905
post	get
the first solution that i used was 3des to prevent anyone from seeing the clear data that i send via get and post methods to the php webserver

8168905
post	get
i want to know if it s possible to send the data so that they look different in each get and post method and i can decrypt in webserver

8168907
width	height
i have got this half working but when i try and create an if statement to change the width to be 100 and the height to be auto and visa versa depending on which part of the image is bigger it just doesn t change

8168907
width	height
so i am grabing the img which is the child of the div maincontent then changing it s width and height values if needed

8168907
width	height
i have this other piece of code which does work fine and i added the width and height change to the end of the code and it still doesn t work

8168907
width	height
so does the attribute of the border but the width and height doesn t change

8168911
width	height
to not distort them the images must be given their native height and width or a proportional value

8168920
width	height
without some server side code to actually determine the height and width of the image the best idea would be to set either the height or the width but not both

8168923
google-chrome	firefox	textarea	textbox
google-chrome and ie detect the input from the masterpages jquery keyboard and input the chars to the textbox and trigger the javascript counter function so real time updates are given to the user the problem is firefox doesn t trigger this javascript counter from the jquery keyboard the keyboard is updating the textarea but fails to initiate the javascript counter

8168923
mouse	keyboard
it seems to function if i mouse over or key press just nothing from the jquery keyboard

8168938
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
if a datatable or gridview won t do you can always use a repeater or a listview

8168988
opencv	emgucv
i ve tried using emgucv which is a .net wrapper for opencv but i m having trouble controlling the quality of my images

8168993
width	height
otherwise you could wrap the image in a div set the height and width of the div and hide the overflow or use the image as the background for the div

8168993
width	height
if height and width may be different across images then go with the solutions already mentioned setting either height or width

8169001
int	boolean
it kind of makes sense because a boolean basically is an int which can just take two values but it needs much less operations space than an actual int no arithmetics only a single bit of storage space ..

8169012
ethernet	wireless
most computers have one or two of these in the case of ethernet card wireless device.

8169017

aggregate-functions	sum
you have to use to state group by when using aggregate-functions like sum in select statements

8169022
width	height
set width height float and margin-top of this span to align with base of line height

8169041
width	height
to guarantee that your images are re-dimensioned you can also set a height or width value for images matching the wrapping div value only one value must be assigned so that images are not distorted

8169101
google-chrome	firefox
s doesn t match those in ie as explained in this answer but it does in firefox and google-chrome

8169196
accessor	properties
i ve tried annotating a properties accessor whose return value is a map as follows

google-chrome	firefox
use inspect element in firefox firebug or google-chrome to see what is hapend with the dom and a try .

8169285
int	chars
moreover it s int not chars

8169286
google-chrome	firefox
why does this script work beautifully in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

8169303
put	get
you can also write a custom map and overload the get and put methods to accept an array for get also vararg instead of having to wrap it manually

8169305
air	flashdevelop
using flashdevelop i need to create a tlftextfield in an air as3 project but where do i find the swc to import

8169359
ostringstream	std
or just use std ostringstream

8169380
submit	submission
ideally i don t actually want to have the form submit 3 time as if it was going to a simple email script we d get 3 results through for each complete submission

8169434
int	chars
running either id value through a function will prevent any index use the simple mathematic operations on int would be faster than a cast to a chars type followed by a substring comparison

8169435
width	height
another consideration is on the size of the buttons width and height

8169435
width	height
f the most difficult task in hard coding sprites write down it s coordinates in the large transparent image top left width height

8169444
uilabel	uibutton
an uilabel could be used kind of showing a link but an uibutton might be more appropriate

8169484
jar	war
i exclude all the jar dependencies using maven war plugin

8169494
width	height
also the the map becomes very small even though i have set a height and width to it .here is my code for generating the map

8169521
ienumerable	iqueryable
to working this out is observing when you are working with iqueryable server and when you are working with ienumerable client

8169542
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
do i have to write something to objectoutputstream before opening objectinputstream

8169545

8169568
g++	gcc
send and receive a file in socket programming in linux with c c++ gcc g++

8169572
datamapper	activerecord
you can t migrate from datamapper to activerecord that is counterproductive

8169572
datamapper	activerecord
the level of abstraction of datamapper is way higher than the activerecord s

8169622
post	get
pss i know i am repeating myself but i ll tell it again because i fear that i will get answers not related to the objective of this post

8169647
post	get
you can implement a custom asp.net webpage submit the data from your form to this page and use the page.request.params to get the parameters from your html form provided you submit it via post

8169680
int	boolean
but var can only be of two types either int or boolean false

8169705
post	get
the variable is a combination of and which means that you can t tell the difference between a variable that was sent in a post request through an input tag in your form or a variable that was set in your url as part of a get

8169715
hide	show
however if your problem is exactly as you have described and there are only two options that your script will vary on the simplest solution might be to hide and show two different dropdowns entirely depending on which option is selected

8169731
slideup	slidedown
my problem comes from the fact that i can t use jquery to slidedown or slideup information about these elements because i can t get a unique identifier for each one

8169782
int	boolean
this is also the same reason why you cannot use an int as a boolean expression in c#

since you are using entity framework there is no such mapping option so you could maybe create a specific repository method such as parentrepository.getorderedchildren parent myparent and load your children using a linq join this is the lambda syntax

8171072

mouseleave	mouseenter
without modifying your html structure you need to use mouseenter mouseleave events like so

8171853

mouseout considers only the target of your binding element so if you hover something inside the container it will count as a mouseout while mouseleave understands that only leaving the container is counted as a mouseout

8171853
mouseover	mouseout
so when you hovered over the x button it counted as a mouseout which hides the element and you are now in the plain container which triggers mouseover and this loop causes the strobo effect

my getter setter methods check the value before they set return it

for-loop	loops
also you need to create and add all these three component inside the for-loop providing unique ids depending on i you use to iterate loops

8179262
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
and you can have a string arrays for textviews and buttons to set their names in for-loop which would be easier for you for passing the string you like to set to them in loops

getter	setter
if you used simple getter setter everywhere from moment one now you can add anything you need to them

8179448
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
use unchecked-exception extend runtimeexception for scenarios where you don t expect possible recovery

getter	setter
for doing this i create new instances based on the concrete subtype of a passed oldconnection and pass with a cast the old instance into the constructor so i can easily maintain the inner data for getter and setter

8179482
width	height
2 if you are giving height and width of any widget button or layout in size such as 40px or 40 px etc change this thing into dip device independent pixels

8179492
width	height
you might want to loop through the pixels which is not hard if you know the width and height

8179515
width	height
how can i do to give all my elements attributes as height width position top left .

8179553
width	height
also the only way you ll be able to give multiple elements different height width pos is you would have to post a unique id of each element to the ajax form and then the responce would have to be an object containing the unique id height width pos of that element most likely json so you can select each element by it s unique id and then change the values based on the object returned

8179580
maven	pom.xml
creating a new maven project pom.xml snippet

8179598
bluetooth	usb
you could browse the source to see how android dialer app itself works but if you can send tones through the phone system you would still need to implement the protocol over usb or bluetooth that would probably require some methods that aren t in the api but perhaps may be available in the ndk

8179623
dictionary	map
i d need to see the definition of the map class and the unordered list class but presumably the dictionary is defined as follows

if you are using a winforms application there is a catch handler in it s event loop that pop-up a dialog and prevents windows error reporting wer from kicking in

8181011
zoo	xts
however xts extends and inherits from zoo objects and the zoo package does provide an as.ts method for objects of class zoo

8181011
zoo	xts
so if you get your data into a zoo or xts object you can then coerce to class ts and that should include the na in the appropriate places which arima will then handle if it can there aren t too many missing values

8181248
action-filter	onactionexecuting
if so use action-filter for it override onactionexecuting and supply the data you need into action parameters

8181283

do not setinterval but settimeout and schedule this for one single time

8181293
width	height
you should perform this calculation in both dimensions width and height since the width and height of both the image and the display area might differ

8181293
width	height
also if the image width or height is smaller than displaywidth scale you might want to cap it to be image width instead

8181524
listview	gridview
for this solution i would suggest you to design custom adapter to be displayed either in gridview or in multi column listview

8181559
pop-up	dialog
you may be better off writing a selection event handler the user selects clicks on a row and that data is saved to the users clipboard could be blocked by security features or pop-up in a modal dialog inside a textarea for easy cut and paste

8181576
implements	extends
in java it would make sense to have each of these classes implements an interface or extends an abstract class

8181596
inherited	properties
most of my original objects are inherited from an other so i would want each inheritance-level to care for their own properties

8181596
inherited	properties
the inherited class should override the todto method calling the parents method and adding its own properties to be saved like

it won t be a simple alter storage engine command since i need to add foreign keys to to the current database schema the current myisam db schema does have primary keys though before i convert it over to innodb

8181659
innodb	myisam
my question is once i convert the db over to innodb would restoring the data from the current myisam engine to innodb engine would be as simple as firing a phpmyadmin instance and back up the data minus the db schema or structure and then restore it to the innodb engine

8181690
cos	sin
a fast sin cos approximation is available

8181704
post	get
if this doesnt solve things you will be able to get better help if you post your table structure the query and the code which is accessing the query so we can diagnose the problem more efficiently

8181746
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
indexeddb has been over-engineered in my opinion and is not widely supported yet for all of mozilla s insistence that its better than sliced bread and websql s future is looking a bit uncertain as mozilla is refusing to implement it and it is no longer being worked on due to an impasse between w3c and the browser vendors who have actually implemented it google-chrome safari opera

8181746
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
there is currently a bit of a browser explosion happening thanks to smartphone adoption so its hard to determine how much of the market supports html5 localstorage features but using statcounter i ve been able to calculate that between google-chrome 4+ firefox 3.+ safari 4+ opera 10.5+ and ie 8+ including iphone and android devices you ll have captured around 80-85 of the market with this figure going upwards a rate of 1-2 per month

8181797
innodb	myisam
i keep reading that when you convert your database from myisam storage engine over to innodb engine you must add support for deadlocks in your application code

your constructor has one int and one boolean

8181859

8181899
versioning	upgrade
have your script create a database versioning table with the versioning number date and time of upgrade and the software revision number that performed the upgrade and whether it succeeded or not anything you can think that is useful

8181899
versioning	upgrade
also make sure it inserts a row into your versioning table every time you upgrade

8181899
versioning	upgrade
when you start your binary program get it to check the maximum versioning number against the expected db versioning to ensure that the binary is compatible with the database versioning else upgrade

8181899
versioning	upgrade
extending this further you can upgrade between vastly different versioning by having it loop through a set of upgrade scripts

nswindow	nsbutton
nsbutton is an nsview subclass nsview has a window property which gives access to the nswindow it is in

8181976
nswindow	nspanel
if the button is in an nspanel then its window property would contain that panel nspanel is a subclass of nswindow

8182053
min	max
the rangevalidator s min max values are set in the button s click event

8182068
setinterval	settimeout
basically similar to a settimeout setinterval can also fire later when the page or the os browser itself is busy with other tasks.

8182083
width	height
this causes random sidescatter of the dots in the width direction but no scatter in the height direction

8182086
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval and also settimeout can be affected by the speed of the processor the speed of the browsers javascript implementation as well as the load on the processor

8182091
ubuntu	debian
if running debian or ubuntu you should be able to install valgrind via apt

8182118

8182594
maven	m2e
it does so by mapping maven plugins to special m2e eclipse plugins

8182594
maven	m2e
sometimes when no mapping exists you get a warning and you have a choice of either disabling this part of your build or running the maven plugin in i guess default wrapper provided by m2e

8182649
cos	sin
polar is well-suited to rotation operations and scaling i guess but sticking with cartesian where a rotation is four multiplies see below is probably going to be cheaper than using cos sin acos asin every time you want to do a vector addition

8190637
viewdidload	viewdidappear
this was fixed was found in this so answer applications are expected to have a root view controller at the end of application launch - by by moving the uialertview methods from - void viewdidload to - void viewdidappear bool animated

puts	gets
i am working on an app that gets a bunch of descriptions through xml and then after parsing puts them on the screen

8190724
textview	imageview
using ddms and mat i noticed that while the number of listview objects does not increase the number of textview relativelayouts and imageview were increasing steadily along with the number of times a user has clicked and a new list has been drawn

8190724
textview	imageview	textview	simpleadapter
if you look at the 2 textview to 1 imageview to 1 relativelayout ratio in this template and in the object counts above it seems that imageview textview and relativelayouts created by simpleadapter are not being released properly

8190762
portrait	landscape
may i use something like styles.xml and say that if i have portrait do this and if i have landscape do the other one

8190789

printk calls appear in the kernel message buffer not in your process stdout stderr

the layouts in res layout are applied to both portrait and landscape

8190869

8190869
system.in	system.out
try to create a pipe between system.in and system.out

8190890
google-chrome	safari
the problem is that google-chrome i haven t heard of safari doing this as well but i ll take you word for it kills the selection after the focus event has fired so you need to add a timer

8190890
mouseup	mousedown
you can probably get around that with some handling of mousedown and mouseup events

8190915
stdout	fflush
as mentioned by moastab fflush stdout works for octave

8190915
stdout	stderr
matlab s drawnow function is familiar to those who want to control the redraw graphical objects in matlab but it applies to the stdout stderr buffers as well

8190922
hide	show
if i take out the lines for .replacewith it works fine to show and hide #the-form but with it in.

8190941
udp	tcp
well the thing with udp is that it usually works really well and it has a real low latency compared to tcp

8190941
voip	rtp
that is probably the reason why it is used in almost every voip application for real time video etc see also rtp rfc 3550 in almost every online game etc

8190941
put	get
the bottom line is that when using udp you will have to put a lot more effort into the client intelligence in order to get things right than you would have to using a stateful transport protocol

8190949
hide	replacewith	hide	show
also move the replacewith to the callback function for show and hide

8191065
public	protected
in java there are public protected package default and private visibilities

8191067
for-loop	loops
i d also recommend moving the viewforoverlay calls outside the for-loop since those references won t change during loops so there s no need to call them repeatedly

8191078
scheme	racket
historically scheme not racket has always allowed re-definitions

8191090
virtualenv	setuptools
if you want to stick to a setuptools install you should probably look for a config file there and advertise it loudly to your users but if defaults are needed they should be read from inside the package itself using something like resource_stream so that you can be sure you will find it no matter wether setup was run from system installed easy_install into a virtualenv or by a packaging system like rpm

8191102
post	put
when a user clicks on one of the stories in the index view i want to load that story s post via calling stories story_id post using the ajax .load function and make sure to put the post into that story s correct div created by div_for story posts_bucket_for do

8191235

i added the output getter setter but for some reason it just won t access it when i export import the modified jar

8191244
flac	ogg
libsndfile library is probably the most powerful free audio file library available support for tens of audio file formats including ogg and flac but you read raw audio data - samples so to be able to play them you must send them to the audio device which is not so simple.

8191385
width	height
start with four vertices in a rectangle with 0 0 being the top-left and the texture s width height as the bottom right

8191417
post	get
that it s a servlet isn t why the username password are in the url that s because it s a get request and not a post

8191478
virtualenv	setuptools
by default virtualenv will install a version of setuptools but it does have an option to use distribute instead

8191478
virtualenv	setuptools
a simple workaround when using virtualenv on os x seems to be to also use its no-site-packages option which will prevent the setuptools version from the system python interfering with the required distribute in the virtualenv

8191624

accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
properties accessor methods are what kvc will call if they exist preferred both by kvc and by every sane programmer over direct ivar access

what you can do though is send that json the content body of a post request via the webrequest webclient

8199803

mkmapview	mapkit
unfortunately this is a limitation of the google maps api which only accepts integer values when setting the map s zoom level apple s mapkit code is calling the underlying google maps apis when you set a mkmapview s displayed area and the result â no matter which mapkit method you use to set the area â is a map that s zoomed out to the nearest integer zoom level

8200034
mkmapview	mapkit
troy brant s code takes you full circle and puts a layer above the mapkit apis that allows you to set the zoom level directlyâ but ultimately you don t have precise control over the area displayed by an mkmapview unless the zoom level of your desired map happens to be an integer

8201585
getter	setter
in most cases getter and setter do reveal bad desing

8201585

the main reason to use getter and setter should be for debugging so when you re accessing some base class member from a derived class you have a point you can set a breakpoint at to intercept changes to that member

8201585
getter	setter
if more protected setter getter might be a better option - you don t want to set breakpoints in every class that can possibly modify a member of the base class

8201587
getter	setter
getter and setter methods are an explicit way of saying that this member variable is available for use and usually they should be used to expose the member to external entities

i have a common superclass suppose it s employee which has amongst others subclassing engineer and salesman

8201983
dictionary	map
you re going to need to map the name variations somehow either by totaling each name separately and combining afterward by hand or by making a dictionary up front that identifies all the aliases used by each company

8201988
uiview	subviews
the index is just the uiview s position in the subviews array

8201995
int	double
deal with that by storing your coordinates as double precision values and just convert to int on demand when you need to draw

8202001
public	protected
protected is closer to public than private

8202001
getter	setter
a protected getter and maybe setter can also work

8202001
getter	setter
i don t think that getter and setter are generally bad design

8202004
maven	m2e
the maven eclipse plugnin now called m2e has a nice feature in it which dynamically overlays files

8202006
button	checkbox
i basically have two checkbox and a button and on button click a toast should show up and say which checkbox are checked and which aren t

8202018
post	get
first of all i do not have any code written yet i am only in the design thinking phase so i m doing some research on how to do what i want to do this post is to get some bearings before i start coding

8202023
google-chrome	firefox
btw on my box ubuntu 11.04 the symbols look exactly the same in firefox 7.0.1 and google-chrome 15

8202067
matlab	simulink
there s an open-source http and xml-rpc server for matlab simulink called simserver

8202093
min	max
does some one know if there is a limitations about zooming combined with min max values

8202105
getter	setter
but let s contrast how fields and accessor methods getter and setter enable you to work with data and behaviors

8202130
hide	show
i ve been trying this solution changing show and hide to visibility

8202137
put	get
put image behind it and you get a different context menu for the result

8202138
google-chrome	firefox
the number will be shown in your web developer console of firefox google-chrome

8202144
multiplying	subtract
you could enhance the precision of the calculation when you multiplying the coordinate differences with the trigonometric function instead of multiplying the coordinates and subtract the results

8202150
hide	show
this would be a simple hide and show effect

8202152
strlen	substr
but you can easily get it from these two using as basic string manipulation functions as strlen and substr

8202156
google-chrome	safari
although this does not occur in safari google-chrome ie etc

8202191
implements	extends
a concrete non-abstract class extends from an abstract class must then implements the abstract methods of the extended abstract class

8202196
src	attr
this attr src

8202196
src	attr
this attr src your_new_src

8202304
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu 10.04 linux 64bit and a 32bit version for testing in a virtual box

8202345
int	boolean
gives true as this explicitly converts the int to a boolean

8202391
prepare	execute
it seems to take a lot longer to run this kind of query when i prepare and execute it with bound parameters than when i just prepare and execute a query string with the values included

8202410
rss	feed
i would like to have some good examples of sencha touch for building rss feed

8202415
mamp	wamp
one thing i will say with confidence is that it s easier to standup joomla or something lamp wamp mamp than on the ms webmatrix

8202421
actionscript	mxml
i made the second fix in actionscript not sure if it s possible to do it all in mxml

8202448
portrait	landscape
this is what i want when the application starts up in portrait mode upside-down or not but i want to have this when it starts up in landscape mode left or right

8202453
superclass	subclassing
what you should look at is examples of a subclassing and superclass

8202453
superclass	subclassing
instead of having 1 or 2 tables you ll end up with a max of 3 a superclass and 2 subclassing where needed and they will be more normalized

8202460
youtube	vimeo
it works like this for some sites youtube and vimeo

8202460
youtube	vimeo
is there something i can do or does facebook treat vimeo and youtube as special cases

8202472
ubuntu	linux
if it matters the os is ubuntu linux

8202475
outputstream	inputstream
about your second question when you have an inputstream instance you can just read it byte-by-byte and copy to target out outputstream

8202500
getter	setter
i would like to wrap this in c++ cli so that a c# user would see a class with the same list of params as getter setter

8202511
mouse	keyboard
i think the problem is related to some weird focus condition the keyboard is on a form while the mouse pointer click in another form

8202513
cdr	cons
for instance when you do this define lst 4 5 under the hood this is what gets assigned to lst cons 4 cons 5 so when you evaluate cdr lst you get the second element of the first cons which happens to be cons 5 which in turn gets printed as 5

8202513
cdr	cons
for extracting only the second element in the list not the second element of the first cons which is what cdr does you could

8202513
cdr	cons
5 to build a cons cell and then you can use car cell to extract the first element and cdr cell to extract the second element

8202543
addition	multiplication
the problem is in the classes addition multiplication

8202543
addition	multiplication
just delete or comment out the first 2 lines in the evaluate functions of addition multiplication

8202545
hide	show
the effect you are creating clicking a div show hide it isn t possible with purely css

8202561
for-loop	loops
please note the use of the and instead of the || or and the useless of the i 2 because you can loops only on the odd numbers by changing a little bit the for-loop

8202575
google-chrome	firefox
however in my tests with iis7 as the backend webserver and using ie 7 firefox and google-chrome browsers i did not need to do so

8202612
ubuntu	linux
i have a working project on linux ubuntu 11.04 but when i try to build the same exact code on my windows 7 machine i get the following error

8202658
width	height
the number of pixels of data in the canvas are specified by the height and width attributes in html or javascript

8202658
width	height
adjust the height and width of your canvas by a particular factor 4

8202658
width	height
use css to set the display height and width back to the original size and then

8202677
cos	sin
a cos fi rx 2 + sin fi ry 2

8202677
cos	sin
c sin fi rx 2 + cos fi ry 2

8202762
for-loop	loops
in the first for each loops it adds the images fine and for the next for-loop for uploads ie..for the thumbs div i get this error

8202775
width	height
once the view was displayed i grab the correct width height and display the popup in its correct postion immediately

8202781
mouse	keyboard
i have a cdialog that is calling domodal the dialog is opened everything else is disabled but for some reason i have only the keyboard capture and not the mouse

8202797
int	boolean
bool is the type used by windows api to express a boolean value and is a 32 bit int

8202830
maven	pom.xml
add a new empty profile to your pom.xml eclipse and set this as the active maven profile in your eclipse

8202852
hide	show
i m very new with ios development and i have just created one of my first apps in my .xib file i have a uinavigationbar that i want to hide show when a part of the screen is tapped by the user like in the photo app

8202919
cruisecontrol	jenkins
imo it d be easier to set up a continuous integration ci server like jenkins or cruisecontrol etc

8202934
cos	sin
d sin angle and d cos angle gives you the change

8202935
cos	sin
sin a cos a tan a

8202936
strcpy	strncpy
no because when you call scanf strcpy except for strncpy where you need to manually put zero if it exceeds the size it copies the null terminator for you

8202992
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
then it is easy to serialize and deserialize each player or an arraylist of them using objectoutputstream objectinputstream

8203001
stateless	stateful
but since it s annoying in a stateless web framework like play to manage stateful entities such as the ones defined in the official jpa specification we have provided a special flavor of jpa keeping things as stateless as possible

8203007
pow	sin	pow	sqrt	cos	exp	cos	atan2	cos	sin	cos	sqrt	atan2	sin	atan2	sqrt	sin	sqrt
note the math functions acos asin atan atan2 cos exp log pow sin and sqrt may result in slightly different values depending on the algorithms used by the cpu or operating system

8203007
cpu	processors
that is i assume some languages implement their own algorithms for the above functions and so may be more consistent except for differences in round-off errors introduced by the choice of processors cpu that would exist for all languages

8203007
cpu	processors
anyone know if javascript has it s own algorithms or does it outsource them to the cpu processors like actionscript

8203013
google-chrome	firefox
test in the good browsers google-chrome and firefox

8203013
google-chrome	firefox
test it without javascript enabled just install noscript or similar to google-chrome firefox

8203014
google-chrome	firefox
i have to send a png image through cocoa sockets asyncsockets and i can t manage to send it correctly firefox tells me the image is corrupted and google-chrome doesn t shows anything

8203074
superclass	subclassing
that is no problem and is very useful when you only want to use superclass methods over a set of your own subclassing especially common with view controllers in a navigation stack when the specific type of next view controller is unknown

8203091
express	node.js
if you are looking for serious web development using node.js use express framework

8203099
cos	exp	cos	atan2
note the behaviour of the functions acos asin atan atan2 cos exp

8203099
pow	sin	pow	sqrt	sin	sqrt
log pow sin sqrt and tan is not precisely specified here except

8203101
free	malloc
that s undefined behavior and you re writing to memory that doesn t belong to s1 and would have weird effects maybe even disrupting malloc s backend information making it hard to free memory

8203114
int	chars
my best guess is that strlen is correct in that its a 35 chars string and you re trying to cast that into an int and its too big

8203147
scheme	racket
the more idiomatic scheme racket way to do this would be to write a function that consumes the original input and returns a new separate list that has the modifications you want

8203183
getter	setter
there should be no overhead to synthesized properties to written getter setter as the compiler will create more or less the same at compile time

8203183
getter	setter
at any point in future you can decide to write a custom getter setter

8203184
sorting	filtering
i m using viewer framework in my eclipse rcp application wherein my table has all the capabilities like sorting and filtering the problem is with when i select a row in the table it gets highlighted in blue color by default when a user try to filtering using search box provided which is located above the table then the previously selected row gets faded away.to overcome this i thought it would be better to have a custom color or predefined color like red and which doesn t get faded away even table-viewer loses focus i don t know

8203194
g++	gcc
g++ gcc 4.4.5

8203201
debian	linux
the underlying operating system debian linux in this case does not allow the process to create any more threads

8203204
public	protected
similarly to c++ objective c provides public private and protected scopes

8203204
public	protected
variable scope is defined by public private protected package modifiers

8203212
put	get
but when i use even the most basic programs and incorporate the cin keyword and run the program i dont get an oppurtunity to put in anything during runtime and sometimes it inserts random values by itself

8203234
implements	modifiers
you can access any methods implements in the base class subject to access modifiers regardless of whether they are marked virtual or not

8203235
folder	directory
i rearranged directory so i have now 54 folder in each below 1000 files and committed this to svn

8203246
public	protected
it is access modifiers private public protected that affects if you are able to call the base class method in the derived class or not

8203283
uniq	grep
since you mention grep i m guessing you want to use the shell so uniq will remove duplicates

8203286
textview	imageview
i am using a relativelayout with an imageview and a textview as children

8203303
google-chrome	safari
it also works on all webkit browsers safari + google-chrome

8203303
google-chrome	safari
currently i m working with macvim and less.app and doing tests on both iphone ipad simulators real iphone ipads and sometimes safari or google-chrome when i really need to do hardcore debugging with the developer tools

8203303
google-chrome	safari
then depending on the sub-configuration chosen launch either the iphone simulator the ipad simulator safari or google-chrome clear its cache via applescript

8203365
cobertura	emma
please refer to my post on stackoverflow testng emma cobertura coverage and jdk 7 result in classformaterror and verifyerror

8203381
hide	show
your datacontext class or viewmodel could implement visibility properties to show and hide different parts of the input if the differences are not too great between the uses

8203416
int	chars
unsigned int is still the same size you want unsigned chars

8203433
rank	max
i have tried changing the id to rank and change it so that it first goes and check rank 1 then rank 2 and up to rank 10 max rank but then it still just shows all of the clans in an order which i don t want it to

8203510
hide	show
hide all appropriate divs and then based on change event show the appropriate one

8203518
put	get
cookies get sent back and forth with each request so either don t make too much use of them and don t put too much information in them either

8203531
post	get
i have a script that gets raw data saves it in the database get the item id then post it to an amazon sqs queue

8203582
websocket	pusher
you could connect to the pusher hosted websocket api to see if you can connect

8203583
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
pick one - macports fink or homebrew are the most popular on os x - and stick with it

8203583
fink	macports
you should at some point evaluate what packages you have installed with fink and macports pick one install any missing ports packages in it and entirely delete the other package system

8203593
super	implements	super	self
the first method copyfrom self event can be implements by calling the super -method

8203656
cos	sin
when you pass such a large value into sin cos or any of the periodic trig functions you have to remember that there s an implicit modulo by

8203685
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
jsfiddle tested in firefox google-chrome and opera

8203694
rss	feed
you wouldn t use sencha for the rss feed it s would just be standard rails code

8203702
qthread	qmainwindow
i have a qmainwindow that starts a qthread and waits for data from the network

8203720
getter	setter
perhaps creating file.prototype.filename setter and getter that set get name will solve your problem

8203727
button	checkbox
i also believe in this case you are looking for a radio button and not a checkbox

8203727
button	checkbox
checkbox allow for multiple checks in a set of boxes where radio button only allow for one to be chosen from within a group

8203735
inherited	properties
in the simplified code below i am trying to inherited the name properties from the synthesizer class to the roland class but the only way i seem to be able to access it is by using synth2.prototype.name rather than by synth2.name which returns undefined

8203760
fast-forward	merge
you can use git merge --no-ff to avoid performing a fast-forward merge and thus always creating a merge commit

8203762
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
then in the qgraphicsscene that s associated with the qgraphicsview i reimplemented the dropevent function

8203784
fast-forward	merge
if the current state of a branch is just a series of commits based on the head of another branch a so-called fast-forward merge is performed

8203790
width	height	jeditorpane	jviewport
jeditorpane seems to have a very interesting feature it seems to track its parent width and determines the preferred height accordingly also if the parent is not a jviewport

8203790
jtextpane	jeditorpane
just replace new jeditorpane with new jtextpane a richer subclass of jeditorpane and the feature disappear

8203790
width	height
this means that first the size width must be set then the preferred size height will be ok

8203790
jtextpane	jeditorpane
but just for jeditorpane not for jtextpane

8203790
jtextpane	jeditorpane
it has been used a jtextpane in place of jeditorpane

8203790
jtextpane	jeditorpane
summary the track size property is observed in jeditorpane but nothing similar exists in jtextpane

8203790
jtextpane	jeditorpane
at this point the feature seems implemented by the document implementation and not by the jeditorpane or jtextpane itself

8203790
width	height
i also notice that the good javax.swing.text.plaindocument that gives us this great service of calculating the height of a component when the width is given through setsize isn t assignable to a jtextpane that expects a styleddocument instance

8203840
post	get
as for your other post related to display some circles as linearlayout s background i m playing with inset scale layer drawable resources see drawable resources for further information to get something working to display perfect circles in the background of a linearlayout but failed at the momentâ

8203841
innodb	myisam
after discussion this in comments and hearing that myisam is in use and that there are alot of writes i m suggestion you move to innodb

8203841
innodb	myisam
innodb is also being developed more than myisam

8203874
int	chars
in c when you use a chars or a short in an expression it is automatically converted into an int

8203914
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
their inherited model using goog.inherit and goog.base simply copy prototype members from the superclass to the subclassing

8203928
uiview	subviews
basically i ve just added my header uiview as a webview.scrollview subviews

8203983
min	max
use group by and use group functions max min group_concat etc for time column

8203989
qdatastream	qbytearray
if you want to send the whole image in one go you could try using qdatastream for serialization of a qbytearray

8203989
udp	tcp
as udp doesn t provide ordering guarantees like tcp the fragments could come in the wrong order without the qdatastream header

8203989
udp	tcp
you may want to read a comparison of tcp and udp and evaluate which fits your needs better

8204002
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and safari however it will not work in internet explorer as it does not seem to be setting cookies

8204002
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari firefox

8204035
boxlayout	miglayout
other layoutmanager exist each having strength and weaknesses flow layout miglayout boxlayout

8204123
gtk	cairo
i am currently trying to print files or text to a printer not to a terminal etc. in haskell with gtk 2hs using graphics.ui.gtk.printing cairo and pango

8204124
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop to repeat loops a certain known in advance number of times

8204129
rss	feed
a view is basically a web page an rss feed a csv file in fact any kind of data that your application might output to the end user

8204130
oncreate	onstart
i tried putting the code into onstart instead thinking that oncreate might run too early creating a race-condition but no luck with that either

8204149
listview	gridview
for the child records you seem to want either a gridview or a listview

8204155
mojolicious	catalyst
also after this you can look at modern toolkits like catalyst mojolicious

8204171
istream	getline
defines std istream getline std istream std string

8204171
istream	getline
defines std istream getline char_type s streamsize n

8204209
screens	tablet
currently there is much diversity of devices conventional computer web browsers mobile browsers browsers tablet etc all with some limitations especially concerning screens resolution

8204218
fast-forward	merge
most of the time that works fine but certain directory operations can conflict with each other even when you are doing the svn equivalent of a fast-forward merge in which case you will have a lot of manual cleanup to do

8204227
express	node.js
i just started getting into node.js and followed this great tutorial on node.js at howtonode express and mongod

8204234
put	get
i want to get all researchers information from the database and put it in the researcherlist arraylist that i created and my response to client will be list of researchers

8204265
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
with opera safari and firefox it works perfectly but with google-chrome it doesn t works because google-chrome use an other protocol draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-08

8204341
for-loop	loops
according to the java language specification â 14.14.2 the variable of an enhanced for-loop must be local to loops

8204341
for-loop	loops
conceptually this last perfectly legal loops could have been used as the functional equivalent of the second enhanced for-loop above the one that does not compile

8204341
for-loop	loops
also just as with the regular loops an enhanced for-loop using a bare variable name that was not defined the line state state

8204354
width	height
1em is the height of an m rather than the width

8204354
width	height
and you will notice width and height of the span are different

8204379
unsigned	short
for example is going to be when converted to unsigned short int

8204396
int	chars
there is no semantic difference here but a subtle difference in bytecode ch + 1 is an int so the first code snippet does a chars to chars comparison followed by an int to int comparison while the second does two chars to chars comparisons

8204422
spaces	delimiter
you can t easily use the spaces character as both a phrase delimiter and an allowable character within the phrase itself

8204451
oncreate	findviewbyid
try moving the findviewbyid into the oncreate and check if it works there

8204458
redhat	fedora
in fedora redhat you could use chkconfig --list | grep named to check the status then use service named start to start it up and chkconfig on named to have it start up at boot time

8204463
children	parent
a parent doesn t have any children that themselves have child children

8204535
maven	pom.xml
also i was following an example of a maven pom.xml project and i have this in my pom.xml does this mean spring will use javax.inject as its dependancy injector engine

8204580
children	parent
now i need to get the parent text minus the children text

8204594
width	height
make the star image the width height you want for the whole blue block and leave the area around the star transparent

8204594
hide	show
show hide the highlight images based on which tab you re currently in

8204599
regexbuddy	rubular
you can test your regex using a regex tool like regexbuddy or rubular there are tons of regex testers online or a text editor that supports regex

8204700
put	get
i then want to call this method from outside but being very new to java i am not sure how to get that sting in put it in hm object like the one thats commented out

8204722
x86	64bit
note the x86 today definitely does not fetch one byte at a time when it decodes an instruction sensible sized reads occur probably 64bit at a time and the processor will pull the bytes out of that as needed

8204723
post	get
name is also used to label the fields in the message send to a server with an http hypertext transfer protocol get or post when you hit submit in a form

8204777
kde	gnome
ideally i would like to do the same for kde kdm and gnome 2 versions as well

8204898
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
inspect element in google-chrome firefox and view source in safari are there because the internet is open sourced

8204957
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox it s possible but it s not yet standardized as far as i know google-chrome probably supports it as well

8205029
rss	feed
to read an rss feed

8205029
rss	feed
how will be a good way to sanitize rss feed input

8205044
width	height
your image takes 3264 1952 4 25.5mb width height argb

8205072
cpu	processors
several techniques were utilized to simulate the co-handling of multiple tasks processes threads user interfaces by techniques known as multi-tasking co-operating or preemptive multi-user aka time-sharing multi-threaded with threads being more lightweight than processes as viewed by the operating system by a single processors by dividing the cpu s usage in varying manners to give the appearance of multiple tasks running simultaneously but technically they are merely stopping and starting so fast that the human user cannot detect the pauses

8205095
ienumerable	ilist
after that your usercontrol will implement the imagesource your ilist or ienumerable of images and your interval as dependency properties

8205163
min	max
i have a winforms usercontrol in a dll that has it s max size and min size set to 600x500

8205192
memcpy	memmove
it is entirely possible that in most implementations the cost of a memmove function call will not be significantly greater than memcpy in any scenario in which the behavior of both is defined

8205192
memcpy	memmove
a memmove function written entirely in portable c would on many platforms probably take at least twice as long to execute as would a memcpy also written entirely in portable c

8205192
memcpy	memmove
i don t know of any that will do it with memmove although in some cases an optimized version of memcpy may offer the same semantics as memmove

8205192
memcpy	memmove
in theory a compiler could process memmove by seeing if treading it as memcpy would yield an implementation that would be safe even if the address ranges overlap and call _memmove in those cases where substituting the memcpy implementation would not be safe

8205226
cos	sin
convert all latitude-longitude pairs to x y z triples using the following formulae x sin î cos ï y sin î sin ï z cos î

8205234
width	height
would return a tuple with the width and height of the image

8205238
freebsd	solaris
solaris doesn t support getting it via sysctl on an af_route socket like freebsd does

8205239
width	height
then linearly scale the height or the width to match the device s one and put black rectangles on the borders

8205268
int	chars
on your platform a int is bigger than a chars so you are walking off the end of the array and undefined read really bad things are allowed to happen when you do that

8205279
fixed-point	rational-numbers
you can either use some sort of fixed-point interpretation of integers measure everything in units of 1 1000 or you can use decimal floats rare or you can store rational-numbers quotients of integers

8205279
subtraction	addition
if you only do addition and subtraction fixed-point would be the natural way to go

8205284
int	boolean
conversation has relevant fields id int user1_id int user2_id int user1_deleted boolean user2_deleted boolean created_at datetime updated_at datetime

8219217
x86	64bit
keep in mind that by default on x64 os an application compiled as both cpu x64 and x86 will use the 64bit version of the driver this means that if you install the 32bit version of the odbc driver and compile the executable as both cpu or x64 you will get the error so you have to compile the application only x86

8219225
versioning	upgrade
as for a tutorial the best way to learn how to upgrade code from one versioning to the other is to read the changelog of the 1.3 to learn about the differences with 1.2 and from the 1.3 to the 1.4 if you want to upgrade to the latest versioning

uigesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer
what you are referring to is called a uigesturerecognizer particularly a uiswipegesturerecognizer with direction uiswipegesturerecognizerdirectionleft

8219857
subtract	add
so you should take the utc time subtract 6 hours off do the check and then add the hour back on if applicable

8219860
width	height
by default the position for each item is static so all i did was change it to absolute so that when the src of the image changes and thus its width and height it doesn t mess with the position of the other elements

8220006
gridview	onclientclick
inside the gridview i have an imagebutton with an onclientclick method

8220006
gridview	onclientclick	updatepanel	onclientclick
previously to get the onclientclick method to fire i would make sure the gridview wasn t in an updatepanel and that the pageload databinding of the gridview was in an if not ispostback

updatepanel	onclientclick
is there a way to use an updatepanel and if not ispostback and still get the onclientclick method to be called

8220031
width	height
my idea is that i should draw horizontal and vertical lines and calculating the width and height by dividing the range of the boundaries by n

8220046
for-loop	arrays
i m going to hazard a guess that you re not getting out of the for-loop because you re exceeding the bounds of either midrep which you haven t given us the type of or diar1 which is clearly an arrays of fileinfo objects

8220106
min	max
edit ah i see what you mean fluid with maximum width most of the aforementioned stands change 95 to 100 and min to max

8220110
stdout	stderr
means redirect stdout to dev null and stderr to the place where stdout points at that time

8220110
stdout	stderr
if you want stderr to occur on console and only stdout going to dev null you can use

8220110
stdout	stderr
in this case stderr is redirected to stdout your console and afterwards the original stdout is redirected to dev null

8220148

i am attempting to consume my zenfolio rss feed so that i can display the images in the feed

8220148
rss	feed
how can i access the url value of the media thumbnail and media content elements in my rss feed

8220165

now you just need to hide and show this eventbox via your callbacks

8220174
min	max
i have points of 512 steps between the min and max values

8220187
width	margin
so if you need to have a 1024 pixels width website you just make your container to be 1024 pixels fat and margin auto

8220192
post	get
when i click any of the boxes i do get the post that are in that category but there s no formatting just the header sidebar and footer

8220316
post	get
i did also go through this facebook fql to get all status messages from an app post and added the limit but still it doesnot work

8220328
express	node.js
also use express npm library instead of plain node.js web server - it does most of this work on sending and receiving json on server for you

8220423
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
appdelegate - uitabbarcontroller - uitableview - uiviewcontroller within which the mpmovieplayerviewcontroller is called

8220444

this value is then cast to an unsigned integer which turns into a very large value

8220450
width	height
green border around the width of 1440 and height of 745

8220468
google-chrome	firefox
i was using this with great success in google-chrome and firefox

8220476

i need to find a way so that if i pull multiple rss feed into one table and articles with the same title have the same value of remote_id how can i make sure i do not insert a duplicate value

8220506
width	height	subtract	add
edit it appears you need to subtract double the width of the border you plan to add from the width and height to avoid showing any scrollbars

8220517
children	parent
array_key_exists tree parent children id

8220517
children	parent
array_key_exists tree parent children id

8220553
getter	setter
also is there anyway to control when in the compilation pipeline i can generate code because we have a lot of data objects using public fields instead of getter setter but that are bindable and so if i could generate the proxy based on the generated getter setter methods that would work

8220606
width	height
how can i get calculate with image height and width

8220672
int	double
a c90 compiler will assume that sqrt returns int -- and it will generate code to convert the result from int to double

8220723
ant	maven
i ve always taken the classpath for granted - its something that eclipse maven ant etc handled for me

8220723
ant	maven
3 what is happening under the hood when tools like maven ant add ignore elements to the classpath

8220732
rss	feed
from an rss feed how do you get a string of everything that s inside each item tag

8220738
queue	fifo
this queue is the correct solution for my requirements and it more importantly allows serialisation of my blocks to be run on the fifo order

8220773
for-loop	loops
run a for-loop by repeating loops based on number of fields

8220883
google-chrome	firefox
you can change volume levels under both firefox and google-chrome like this

8220919
spaces	delimiter
now the problem is the only the first character s before the spaces delimiter gets put into the array

8220924
inherited	properties
this is actually very easy a uiscrollview inherited from a uiview so you just need to set the backgroundcolor properties

8220943
timsort	in-place
so if you want to test sorting some care is required so that one pass at an in-place sort doesn t affect the next pass with already sorted data that of course would make the timsort really shine because it performs best when the data already partially ordered

8220956
boost	stl
is there any standard solution for example in stl or in boost

8220966
bmp	png
for example that list typically returns both png and bmp and other formats

8220966
bmp	png
but there s not one png nor one bmp

8220966
bmp	png
heck bmp is actually so complex that i think that you can embed png encoded pixels inside a bmp shell

8220966
bmp	png
the error consists in thinking that there s one png or one bmp format

8220976
google-chrome	firefox
the same behavior appears to come up in both firefox and google-chrome

8221049
pivot-table	crosstab
note that a pivot-table is also known as a crosstab or cross tabulation

8221055
setinterval	settimeout
then again it s better than settimeout setinterval which fires only once per second if the tab is not active in google chrome a common use case for audio file listening

8221055
setinterval	settimeout
if however in your app you can ensure that the tab is active while listening then settimeout or setinterval is better as it can fire as often as 100 times per second

8221064
int	boolean
queueconnection.createqueuesession boolean transacted int acknowledgemode

8221112

i personally use cherokee but apache or nginx or anything else can use it too

8221257
postgresql	mysql
due to the complexity of sql language of various databases such as oracle sql server db2 mysql teradata postgresql the sql parser we created to support those databases was a little bit complicated as well

8221275
floor	sqrt
at least with gcc on my machine it s clearly the fastest integer square root function i ve tested including the functions in hacker s delight this page and floor sqrt from the standard library

8221275
integer	unsigned
it can t be generalized for full-blown 64-bit unsigned integer inputs without losing precision though and the first signed conversion would also have to be replaced by a load intrinsic to handle values 2 63

8221276
gxt	smartgwt
depend on smartgwt or gxt

8221276
gxt	smartgwt
smartgwt and gxt will seem attractive for a simple project

8221278
innodb	myisam
i considered using a myisam db and a full text search but decided that because of the performance hit it would be better to stick with innodb

8221309
inherited	properties
this is out-of-scope of the lan properties gui but you should look up dllgetclassobject a c++ class that inherited from ccomobjectroot and ccomcoclass a call to object_entry_auto and a begin_com_map if you re new to com.

8221341
width	height
how to get the browser window size without the width and height of the scroll bars

8221438
children	parent
on my system wait will only return when direct children complete such that your version with wait will print deterministically children will always complete before parent continue

8221442
pop-up	dialog
the lowdown - i have an asp.net form in an intranet engineering application that needs to pop-up a jquery dialog when the submit button is pressed in certain circumstances

8221442
submit	submission
in the certain circumstances the user needs to confirm a question and the form needs to continue with submission including executing the server-side code for the submit button s click event

8221451
min	max
use the main query as a subquery taken for each record the min timestamp and max timestamp and so take the respective open and close prices for them

8221471
children	parent
so if you have a parent file you can create references to children without the need to specify separators

8221473
folder	directory
try recreating the symlink from libsystem.b.dylib to libsystem.dylib or copying the lib into the iphone simulator folder from your usr lib directory

8221908
queue	fifo
this queue orders elements fifo fifo .

vb.net	vb6
conversion of 3 user controls from vb6 to vb.net have done

8226464
vb.net	vb6
is it due to vb6 to vb.net conversion

8226486
versioning	upgrade
i would like to see if there is a way to create an install4j configuration that allows me to push both stable and unstable releases in such a way that the majority of clients will get the stable upgrade path 1.0.0- 1.0.1- 1.1- 1.2- 2.0 etc and a selection of beta customers will get more bleeding edge versioning 1.0.0- 1.0.1-beta-1- 1.0.1-beta2- 1.1- 1.2-beta1 etc

8226620
french	polish
i create a few plugins and create a basic resource file default - english and one for a specific culture at the time of writing it s for polish localizations but later i ll need to add french as well

8226635
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
i can t say with any certainty what your problem is but there s a good chance it has to do with the changes to uinavigationcontroller which caused uiviewcontroller s navigationcontroller to be nil for popups with parentviewcontroller taking its place

8226635
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
unfortunately parentviewcontroller is new so you must eg test respondstoselector selector parentviewcontroller and take parentviewcontroller if it exists otherwise navigationcontroller

8226689
dictionary	map
there should also be a key value pair in the plugins dictionary in the phonegap.plist file to inform phonegap about the plugin and how to map it to a objective-c class

8226690
portrait	landscape
in this function i reload the layout as i have difernt layout for landscape and portrait

8226694

if we would create a new object that inherited from array.prototype and also give it a length properties tada we would have just created a javascript array

8226863
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if i test my website on firefox google-chrome safari ie7 ie8 is perfect

8226893
keyevent	onkeydown
the reason why onkeylongpress is never called is that you return true in onkeydown without telling the framework that this might be a long press - causing the keyevent to stop its flow through the different event handlers

8226901
post	get
so the plan is to write a cgi program and communicate with it from the clients through http using get and post

8226952
typedef	struct
your struct typedef is wrong you separate declarations with semicolons not commas in a struct declaration as in normal code

8226954
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
with major browsers i mean google-chrome firefox safari opera

8226954

it seems that they don t get an appropriate height width

8226957
for-loop	loops
move the for-loop in a function and call it after the while loops

8226972
put	get
use a key like thread_no put to mdc mdc.put when a thread invoke logger the first time and check this key to get the fileappender for it

8226983
children	parent
for example should deleting a parent also delete all its children

8226986
jobs	cron
in php we have cron jobs where the hosting server automatically picks up and executes a task as per the schedule given

8226986
jobs	cron
what would be a good alternative to use for cron jobs in asp.net

8226996
int	chars
public int read chars buf

8227057
for-loop	loops
as you have a single parameter and setting the same time and agian in the for-loop the last value in the list will be set effectively to the parameter in the last iteration of loops

8227087
onkeyup	onkeydown
why not use onkeyup as well as onkeydown

8227137
wakelock	powermanager
then you should acquire a wakelock using the powermanager class to ensure that at least the cpu will be maintained on in order to allows your application code to be performed and releasing it when not needed anymore this will allows the phone to returns in sleep mode to avoid a useless battery usage

8227138
put	get
there is no easy answer for what you re trying to do but the above link will help you if you are willing to put in the time and effort to get it done

8227166
lisp	smalltalk
lisp is like smalltalk in that there isn t a clear boundary between the language and the library that it uses

8227166
lisp	smalltalk
well lisp has some in the language and some in the libraries while smalltalk has it all in the libraries except that the compiler cheats and hard codes some of them so there isn t really much difference in the end. in lisp a program is an s-expression and editing programs is editing s-expressions

8227168
put	get
now when i try to put the logic into a method and use its delegate in the query there s no compile error either but i get an exception

8227183
google-chrome	firefox
should display properly on the major browsers ie firefox google-chrome

8227217

all pojos in library extends hibernatedaosupport and implements basic op interface crud

8227285
sorting	grouping
how to handle sorting the different users grouping

8227332
chunked	transfer-encoding
the data is returned with the header of transfer-encoding chunked

8227336
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the shadow is considered outside the total window area and therefore cannot be seen

8227353
post	get
however in your particular case you seem rather to be interested in plain get requests instead of post requests as all you want is simple page-to-page navigation

8227403
sin	sqrt	sin	math.h	math.h	sqrt
i ve tried several ways to solve this out and found out that when i comment out all calls to math.h functions like sin or sqrt the application launches correctly

8227433
chunked	transfer-encoding
since you mentioned a transfer-encoding chunked header i am guessing you are reading a http response complete with headers

8227447
google-chrome	firefox
does anyone know why this very simple jquery animation works perfectly in some browsers like google-chrome and seems to be bugged in firefox 7.0.1

8227502
sudo	passwd
but i can t do sudo from php because the command asks for the su passwd

8227516
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have some galleries on which work perfectly in ie google-chrome and the desktop versions of safari firefox and others

8227535
getter	setter
i created a test recently around a property with only a setter today i modified the property to include a getter in the interface and the test case then failed

8227567
hide	show
you can change the value to the div id - hold all the div s in one container and on each change go over them with a loop each and check if the val id show else hide

8227571
stdout	stderr
so parent gets input from stdin but redirects stdout and stderr to two pipes

8227640
sudo	passwd
you can send set sudo to get passwd from standard input using -s argument

8227643
getter	setter
a stub will create its own getter and setter that can t verify behavior

8227688
int	double
looking at code change do you know the difference between int and double math

8227737
implements	extends
initially i thought you may have implements sunw.io.serializable rather than java.io.serializable but it extends the io class so it should work even with it

8227799
int	double
according to the standard the overload for int long float double long double should exist

8227799
int	double
this template would take all built-in integral types other than int and long and give a return value of double

8227812
opera	firefox
i am seeing the requests from firefox 5.0 and below and opera 10.0 and below causing this problem

8227813
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i would like the caret position to be after the - this works in google-chrome opera firefox and safari but in ie the caret initially is in the correct place but then after a slight pause jumps to before the -

8227830
sorting	filtering
it might be much more efficient to get information directly from these tables by sql already cutting down the amount of information filtering or sorting before processing within clojure itself

8227841
pop-up	dialog
temporary solution is to display invite dialog as a pop-up instead

8227899
getter	setter
this is the error im getting 11-22 14 37 35.848 e propertyvaluesholder 3481 couldn t find setter getter for property text with value type class java.lang.string

8227901
wordpress	joomla

8227967
width	height
you can put a div with predefined width and height inside each cell make the div position relative

8227987
nunit	mstest
i could probably get another tool but changing the tools i already have such as moving from mstest to nunit or tfs2008 to tfs2010 will not be possible

8227990
requestfactory	gwt
to talk to your gwt server-side you can use for example dispatchasync or requestfactory

i have added 9 uiview as subviews of uiscrollview with the below code

8228003
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora	rpm	yum	dpkg	aptitude
better yet use the package system of the distribution s you want to target .deb packaging on debian ubuntu mint with aptitude or apt-get themselves using dpkg yum rpm on redhat fedora etc etc

8228003
dlsym	dlopen
they can be programmatically loaded with dlopen dlsym

8228005
width	height
make a div where the image is as background image width 100 height 100 so the image is over the default background color

8228062
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this effect occurs only in ie browser firefox safari google-chrome does the transition just fine

8228072
memcpy	memset
edit original code was wrong replaced original memcpy with memset

8228163
google-chrome	firefox
i tried a simple code snippet in firefox google-chrome and ie

8228188
paperclip	fog
i m using paperclip to manage uploads backed onto s3 via fog

8228204

you can get the value you need from the jquery control and put it in a hidden field in the form you want to submit

8228231
post	get
however i cannot seem to get the submit button on the smtp_server partial view to post

8228231

8228307
min	max
support for min chars max chars on tag

8228334
mouse	keyboard
if you don t need keyboard or mouse input how about running your application as a screensaver

8228367
google-chrome	safari
i have been noticed only today that after i upgraded mootools to 1.25 if an user browsing with google-chrome i guess also with safari uses the datepicker provided with chronoforms is the mootools datepicker library the form is auto-submitted after the click on the date without pressing any submit button

8228403
google-chrome	firefox
css3 might eventually be a solution for it with page top-left styles but currently doesnt seem to work here winvista google-chrome 17.0.942.0 firefox 9.0

8228439
gtk#	monomac
i create a new monomac project though i get the same issue with gtk#

8228517
getter	setter
i don t know about ignoring methods but you could take a tool that autogenerates the unit tests for your getter and setter so those methods are covered

8228517
getter	setter
there was a so question about exactly this here is there a java unit-test framework that auto-tests getter and setter

8228520
firefox	safari
however it doesn t work at all when running in my desktop browser safari 5.1.1 firefox 7 on windows

8228539
pop-up	dialog
since now there is this alert dialog box which pop-up after user pin point it with 2 buttons yes and no so if yes fetch that location address back to the textbox

8228559
gtk#	monomac
monomac projects are not based on gtk#

8228583
folder	directory
this can of course be resolved by copying the contents of the msbuild visualstudio folder to the equivalent directory on the build server but this is not a manageable solution for server configuration

8228588
maven	pom.xml
now i put both project a and b into a multi-module maven project named c and have the pom.xml of project b changed so it includes the dependency of a

8228734
hide	show
i usually show a progress bar after animation completes wait about 50ms on a background thread to allow the progress bar to update it s ui and then bind to the list and hide the progress bar

8228756
width	height
command with width and height corresponding to the width and height

8228762
opera	safari
this is the case for safari 4 opera 11.00 and possibly other browsers.

8228801
return-value-optimization	nrvo
this is called the named returned value optimization nrvo or just return-value-optimization

8228811
mongoid	mongomapper
jcollum the problem is coming from the fact that you are using mongoid but the examples on mongodb.org are using mongomapper

8228812
google-chrome	safari
also it turns out that in the case of google-chrome and safari as well as ie the scrollbar is brought back to the top for a split second when the page is reloaded

8228823
put	get
in the above example mysessionbean implements the map interface and i have my own custom get method that will create an object and put it in the map if none exists for the key params.id

8228948
many-to-many	one-to-many
i have a many-to-many association in ef code-first as explained in this question and i want to use a one-to-many to the same entity as well

8228990
folder	directory
but in eclipse i could not find the lib folder even after expanding all of the directory shown in the navigator area

8229026
inherited	properties
unfortunately the cascading and inherited level 3 spec does not appear to propose a way to reset a style properties to its browser default

8229026
inherited	properties
however there are plans to reintroduce a keyword for this in cascading and inherited level 4 â the working group simply hasn t settled on a name for this keyword yet the link currently says default but it is not final and it conflicts with the cursor properties anyway

8229026
inherited	properties
for example if an author specifies all initial on an element it will block all inherited and reset all properties as if no rules appeared in the author user or user-agent levels of the cascade

8229033
ssl	https
using ssl for https transfer of wsdl files

8229033
ssl	https
so you need to either download the .wsdl file manually and run you existing wsdl2h on it or rebuild wsdl2h with make secure so that it knows to include the ssl libraries and support for https

8229068
google-chrome	firefox
have you installed firebug if you use firefox or do you use google-chrome

it works in firefox but not on my ipad in the safari browser

8229106
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this works under firefox very slow as i ve supposed ie 9 and google-chrome quite fast but under opera it is not working

8229157
move	drag
i would like the user to be able move a widget within a layout window in sense drag and drop within the same window

8229157
move	drag
i ve seen drag and drop examples which are around 1000 lines of code which enable dragging between screens and different widgets but i intend to only move the widget in the screen

8229160
children	parent
using normal opacity affects the children of the element so the text just gets 100 of the parent opacity which in this case is 0.12

8229236
maven	cobertura
i use the cobertura maven plugin for one of my project

8229264
qstring	qbytearray
a qstring can be re-created from a qbytearray but be sure to use qstring.fromutf8 since the constructor for qstring that takes a qbytearray assumes it s in ascii

8229264
hash	md5
...but note that qt has built-in support for cryptographic hash of qbytearray as long as you re happy with md4 md5 or sha-1

8229355
width	height
they should get bigger and after this they should get to their old width and height

8229383
maven	m2e
the best way to learn how jung2 works is to look at its samples from svn repository using maven svn checkout jung-read-only via m2e maven eclipse plugin

8229439
nsscanner	nsstring
use the floatvalue nsstring method or a nsscanner which is more powerful and flexible

8229468
google-chrome	firefox
is what it s supposed to look like but when i look at it with google-chrome or firefox i get this

8229508
folder	directory
remember that in windows you cannot create a directory by yourself with name .m2 and so you have to cut the directory paste in in c and then copy it back into your user folder

8229515
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
depending on the selection you can push a specific uitabbarcontroller to the uinavigationcontroller

8229535
width	height
i want to add dynamically to a container but i want this container to have fixed height and width the added divs should scale themselves to fit in the container thus also avoiding scroll bar in the container

8229536
rspec	capybara
try using the capybara rspec matcher have_select locator options instead

8229564
folder	directory
i really think that i need to use a bash script that either iterates through virtual hosts from httpd.conf or uses find or something and one way or another cd s into every site install directory inside very installation platform s sites folder we have a pretty messy setup and runs drush upwd admin --password newpassword

8229588
nsmutablestring	nsstring
given that neither 0x02 or 0x03 will cause the nsstring to terminate if you re confident about the length then i think the easiest thing to do is to remove them after the nsstring is created via stringbyreplacingoccurrencesofstring or nsmutablestring s replaceoccurrencesofstring withstring options range saving you from any errors where 0x02 or 0x03 crop up in the byte stream as part of a multi-byte character

8229621
h.264	webm
additionally although brightcove announced plans to support webm as well as h.264 18 months ago it seems that the html5 player still only supports h.264

8229643
maven	pom.xml
more likely you are wondering how this new jar file can be added to other maven projects by simply adding a dependency in the pom.xml file

8229685
inherited	subclassing
so i created subclassing that inherited from asihttprequest and i m trying to override requestfinished

8229694
width	height
you say you want the container to have fixed height and width but then you make it to have dynamic height and width

8229728
folder	directory
i know with my version of rails 3.1.1 the javascript_include_tag defaults to the app assets javascript directory not the public javascripts folder

8229786
oncreate	setcontentview
your custom dialog class will have an oncreate callback in which you can call setcontentview to whatever view you want just like with an activity

8229804
hash	md5
i am using the following command in cmd to generate md5 hash for my app using google maps

8229804
hash	md5
the command runs and no error is shown but md5 hash is not displayed in cmd

8229804
hash	md5
earlier i generated api key for md5 hash regarding the following command

8229816
width	height
how can i control the styling and the width height of the popup made by jquery

8229828
capistrano	bundler
i am using capistrano to deploy the application code but when i run cap deploy then it fails to install gems using bundler because it expects the gemfile.lock to be in the application directory whereas it is actually in the application rails_code directory

8229842
width	height
you can specify the height and width in the arguments

8229849
width	height
to get an idea of the size of the image itself you should multiply the width height and bytes per pixel

8229882
int	chars
you can use a chars array instead of an int to store large binary numbers for your palindrome class

8229899
google-chrome	firefox
the expected behavior is seen in the image above and is present in ie8 firefox and google-chrome

8229904
factors	matrix
this is making me feel dumb but i am trying to produce a single vector df list etc anything but a matrix concatenating two factors

8229926
packets	pcap
i have a pcap file which have packets

8229932
post	put
there is a default mapping between http methods post put etc. and the functions defined in delphi this is done by a delphi component

8229937
google-chrome	safari
it does not find the geo location on safari and google google-chrome

8229937
google-chrome	safari
can some one tell me how i could make this geollocation example run on safari and google google-chrome

8229975
hide	show
i am trying to hide and show cloned divs

8230020
width	height
i have defined the width and height of a low density screen on my emulator but all of the images and text are now just huge

8230027
for-loop	loops
essentially i call mpi_barrier inside a for-loop and mpi_barrier is visible to all nodes yet after 2 iterations of loops the program becomes deadlocked

8230045
range	max
what i want to be able to do is allow the user to switch between the y-axis going from 0 to max and 0 to the auto range value

8230071
qstring	qchar
eta qstring stores data as 16 bit qchar in order to support unicode

8230090
portrait	landscape
i have a system.window.controls.printdialog and i want to print pages with landscape mode and portrait mode in with single printticket but it seems i only can set the orientation once

8230090
portrait	landscape
there i need pages with landscape and portrait mode in onc document

8230111
oncreate	setcontentview
add this to you oncreate method after you call setcontentview

8230146
youtube	vimeo
if it is a third-party player like for example the jw player or the players from youtube or vimeo you would have to look in to what they support individually

8230162
width	height
the image is too wide the width height and height width need to both be 3 from the docs

8230162
gif	png
we support png jpeg and gif formats

8230169
ready	each
so far i have sped it up slightly by making my stored proc return some of the html ready to be inserted into each element rather than having multiple if statements within the loop and i changed the loop to a while rather than for each which has helped slightly

8230198
filtering	grouping
i can t figure out the correct way to get a collection of models from the server into my backbone collection assuming i don t want all the models from the db but rather a grouping of models filtering by a specific model property

8230216
hide	show
using show and hide should prove more robust and simpler too

8230224
ssl	https
another way to solve this you can force your code to accept any ssl cert please refer to this discussion accepting a certificate for https on android

8230250
coldfusion	cfchart
i believe that coldfusion s cfchart tag attempts to scale the chart automatically to what it deems the best fit

8230306
min	max
i thought the best way to do this is to obtain the max number and the min number and then populate a table variable with all of the numbers in the sequence

8230311
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
also note that mouseout doesn t actually work very well - hover works using pseudo-events mouseenter and mouseleave emulating some msie functionality

8230314
tiff	png
if i render to png or tiff files this looks just fine on all my servers using this same code put .png in place of .emf

8230318
hide	show
also - you might try the jquery show and hide functions documentation here

8230393
overwrite	preserve
on un x edx is a scratch register caller preserve that gets overwrite when you make a function call

8230429
google-chrome	firefox
this is occuring in both firefox and google-chrome browser

8230498
width	height
however you d then have to communicate a message between the gl thread that calls ondraw and the main ui thread which is the only one allowed to change views width height etc

8230575
folder	directory
here is some powershell that will search the appdata directory for all folder containing that special plugin name

8230639
comparator	icomparer
i believe you can implement an icomparer to perform custom joins or unions in linq based on how you implement the comparator method

8230641
profiling	instrumentation
when i run profiling with this code in instrumentation i got 35 memory leaks of player

8230680
for-loop	arrays
so i wrote a for-loop that tells me the values which are stored inside the byte arrays

8230683
width	height
probably you should set the padding then you don t need to set the width and height

8230717
pull	push
normally i push pull changes to server a and only push to server b

8230717
pull	push
however sometimes remote server a is unavailable for me and i push pull my changes only to server b

8230717
pull	push
when remote server a is available again i would like as earlier to push pull to server a and only push to server b

8230765
pull	push
you pull from a merge changes in your local repo and push back to both a and b

8230777
put	get
if i put s in it they get spread out with equal length columns

8230806
folder	directory
you need to create a folder call sqldrivers in the directory containing your exe

8230808
disk	ram
hibernate clarification the main difference between sleep and hibernate is that in sleep everything is kept in ram whereas hibernate saves the current state to disk

8230811
hide	show
if you want to keep the state while the app is running - simply keep the dialog around and show hide it as necessary

8230822
implements	extends
public class mysqlite_methods extends sqliteopenhelper implements tables

8230890
awt	swing
you probably can t use a keylistener to check for user keystrokes since keylistener is part of awt swing but you will need a way to get input from the keyboard

8230903
versioning	upgrade
my package installer says there have been 3 minor versioning upgrade since 17.0

8230961
int	double
in this case bar is not a method taking an int and a double

8230961
int	double
instead it s a method taking no arguments returning a function that takes and int an a double

8230967
children	parent
each parent has two children sprites

this could also be used for recursively zipping folder of files and other folder however you would need to scan the directory store the file folder names and attributes in order to create a single stream of bytes which isn t so simple basically implementing unix tar

8231612

however in google-chrome and safari the padding is slightly different

8231612

one of the tenets of oop is that of equivalence as embodied in the liskov substitution principle which means that the protocol public api of a subclassing should be a strict superset of its superclass

8233217
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the reason this is important is that if the subclassing has an api that differs from the one presented by the class it inherited from then it can t be used to substitute for the superclass in all cases

8233217
postgresql	mysql
for example how would you use your subclass to connect to a postgresql database or use a sqlite file instead of using mysql

you could parse the strings into datetimes find the max and the min subtract to find a timedelta and designate the duration based on that timedelta

8233811
free	memcpy
finally and i m getting a bit speculative here it s entirely possible that the jiter can recognize side-effect free constructors and unroll them at jit time into plain old data. if this is the case then the total cost may be just a 16 byte memcpy which is unavoidable anyway

8233834
getter	setter
if you instantiate singletons rather than using static getter setter it will be more difficult to dependency inject without using a di framework unless you pass you singletons in but then you can end up with a long list of parameters

8235895
pull	push
one way to do it would be to go here and look at adb push and adb pull commands this should work so long as the android device is connected via usb but you have to download the sdk and get the files you need as a special app cocktail that you will give to the customers in order for sync-ing to work

perforce	cvs
in the past i have used and administered cvs and perforce in large companies 2000 people for several years

8236068
perforce	cvs
imho perforce is basically a modified cvs which was obfuscated and complicated to the point that it is extremely painful and slow to use and you will need help from their service department to get things done

8236068
put	get
a simple requirement for a vcs is that if you put a file in the repository that you get the same file with the same permissions back -- unaltered

8236068
perforce	cvs
with perforce or cvs this is not the case

8236068
perforce	cvs
creating new branches is slow requires and admin and locks up the version control system in case of perforce or cvs several minutes to an hour

8236068

merging with perforce or cvs is tedious time-consuming and therefore expensive

i expected that by downsizing the main view its children would be shrunk and constrained by their parent view as well

8236362

the only problem is it is resizing the width as well as the height

8236362
width	height
is there a way to override or reset the width after auto resize had solved the height problem or set a minimum width for the label

8236369
smtps	smtp-auth
i d recommend sending the mails not by php s mail function but via smtps possibly even with smtp-auth using something like phpmailer

8236384

8236420
sorting	filtering
localstorage is strictly a key value store so any kind of aggregation sorting filtering will all have to be in your own application code

8236420

i dont know what that means and im not very versed with inputstream and outputstream so im lost as to what the problem could be

why not use jquery s mouseleave and mouseenter methods

8236822

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i ve written some code that contains a main and a number of subclassing that inherited variables from a superclass

8236892
superclass	subclassing
it is expected that additional subclassing will be written in the future so i was wondering if it is possible to save each subclassing and the superclass as seperate modules and that the subclassing will still be able to use have access too the superclass variables and definitions

8236892
superclass	subclassing
meaning they can be written as a stand alone module and the previous subclassing and the superclass don t have to be touched as part of the development but they will still be able to use the suberclasses variables and definitions

8236901
accessor	properties
instead you can do and then set the completionblock with either the straight properties accessor or with -setcompletionblockwithsuccess failure

8236902
google-chrome	firefox
b appears with any browser a only with google-chrome firefox looks ok

8236905

8236957
put	get
subclass hashmap and create a version that lower-cases the key on put and get and probably the other key-oriented methods

8236984
mouse	keyboard
virtual servers with no mouse and keyboard attached can block significantly

8237003
put	get
but if o logn get and put operations are acceptable a treemap with a case insensitive string comparator is an option

8237003
put	get
and if you don t mind creating a new temporary string object each time you do a put or get then vishal s answer is just fine

8237021
matplotlib	scipy
almost all of the stuff is available in libraries scipy and matplotlib

8237029

8237029
width	height
i need to get the height and width of the above control in pixels

8237031
portrait	landscape
you can use savedinstancestate.putparcelablearraylist key value ..the whole idea would depend on whether you want to load the resoures again on orientation change say if your using different layout resources for landscape and portrait modes .otherwise handling using android configchanges orientation would be better choice

8237062
actualheight	actualwidth
you re looking for the control s actualwidth and actualheight

8237065
width	height
even though a trace shows that the width and height are correct

8237065

the only place where i explicitly set a width and height is setting the table width and height

8237192
lxml	libxml2
this bug hasn t been mentioned either in lxml v2.3 bug fix logs or in libxml2 change logs

8237194
apache	nginx
if you have existing php apps or other stuff on your shared host it is pretty easy to set up apache nginx to play nice with both php and ruby apps running on the same box

8237205
post	get
considering that the error only occurs when google translate requests your service could it be possible that google translate does not issue a post request but a get request to your service method

8237206
subclipse	egit
i would also reommend trying egit as i m guessing it will work very similar to subclipse and not cause any significant issues

the main reason i prefer rackspace is that the instances aren t transient all data is gone on reboot like amazon s which can complicate system architecture

8237505
subtract	add
if c were to have adopted the number theory convention it would need to compile additional instructions to compare the sign of the result to the sign of the divisor and if they didn t match then jump to additional code to add or subtract the divisor from the result iow c adopts a convention that corresponds to minimal effort

8237931

so your code may work in portrait but not in landscape mode

8237934
selecteditem	selectedindex
if you set selectedindex in your code then selecteditem will change accordingly

self.session call the generated getter or setter with the property params

i ve already solved that by creating a custom droplocation class which is based on a combination of jtable and jtree versions of it

8240721
jxtreetable	jtreetable
p.s. i ve decided for a custom jtreetable and not for one of the existing components like netbeans outline or jxtreetable because they all appear to be suffering from the jtable.droplocation problem and do not offer support for dropping before or after the selected tree node only inside

8240732

8241104
int	chars
the arithmetic conversion does occur in the example you cite - the unsigned chars result of is promoted to int when it is compared with eof 1

8241104
int	chars
this conversion doesn t undo the result of converting -1 to unsigned chars though - if that conversion results in 255 because unsigned chars is 8 bits then it will remain as 255 when it is converted back to int since 255 is within the range of int

8241104
int	chars
on platforms where int cannot represent all the values of unsigned chars it will be promoted to unsigned int but such platforms are very rare

8241183
pop-up	dialog
2. let the certificate selection dialog pop-up by some api call even some hack with the explorer would be nice - explorer.exe is running but hidden in the background

you can hide show menu bar with window.open

8241569
int	double
thus declaring an int as unsigned almost double the size of the largest possible value that it can otherwise hold

8241577

this is the most reliable way when you are passing int kind of value or other short parameters.more advance in this method if you are using any special chars in the value while passing it through query string you must encode the value before passing it to next page

can we say that a class indirectly inherited methods declared in one of it s indirect superclass regardless of the fact that the method defined in the superclass may have been overridden whilst propagating down the inherited hierarchy thus comments such as the above are based on the fact that the subclassing inherited some method with the same signature as that declared in the superclass

that being said you can look at a positive exponent as indicated repeated multiplication 10 3 is 10 10 10 or 1 000 and you can look at a negative exponent as indicating repeated division e.g 10 -3 is 1 10 10 10 or 0.001

8247465
multiplication	exponent
the other approach as others have noted is to define a positive exponent as indicating repeated multiplication and a negative exponent as indicating the reciprocal of the positive exponent so 10 3 is 10 10 10 or 1 000 and 10 -3 is 1 10 3 or 1 1 000 or 0.001

portrait	landscape
i need to detect an orientation change in my application but i don t want my layout to be changed from portrait to landscape

8248274
portrait	landscape
i want to detect that the user changed from portrait to landscape or viceversa and that is not just detecting if the orientation angle is 90 or 270

8248274
portrait	landscape
i tried overriding onconfigurationchanged and check if orientantion is landscape portrait however this still changes my activity layout to landscape

8248274
portrait	landscape
it has to be something more complex than i want to detect if the user made the complete movement portrait- landscape or landscape- portrait

8248295
int	chars
cin reads the int and leaves the newline chars unread on the buffer so that when you call getline it s as if you immediately hit the enter key and getline reads nothing because it stops before reading the newline chars discards the newline and puts the empty string in

this is not possible if all you have is the sin value different angles can have the same sin but cos differs by sign

8248440
cos	sin	cos	inverse
x87 has square root and sin cos but no inverse sin cos functions

8248534
jar	war
this simple setting would let you build both a war and a jar by default with the classifier classes in a single maven execution

8248587
submit	submission
you could solve this by using delegates but i believe after solving the problem that your event is not firing because the event you are wiring is on form submission but you do not have a submit button on your form

8248588
cos	sqrt
in term of speed square rooting is easy a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method but it is not clear what asin does probably quite costly cos is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than sqrt and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls

8248645
client-side	server-side
if you want to limit the number of characters entered i would suggest that you use server-side validation and or client-side validation

if interop is your purpose go for server-side validation based on schema langage like w3c xml schema or relaxng and client-side simple integrity checking android is an embedded platform after all â

8248754
postgresql	mysql
mysql does not use the system r algorithm used by postgresql oracle and sql server i think which considers not only different merge algorithms mysql only has nested-loop although you can fake a hash join by using a hash index but also the possible ways of joining the tables and possible index combinations

it seems fairly simple and it works properly in ie9 and firefox but in google-chrome each new textbox is pushed over to the right by 2 pixels

8249116
google-chrome	firefox
though this page obviously isn t meant to be used for anything important i feel knowing what is causing this issue may give me more information on why google-chrome is displaying some textboxes on another site i m working on out of line while firefox and ie9 display them just fine

8249123
width	height
in case your form contentpane s width height is smaller than the images width height than a better option would be use

8249123
width	height
in case your image s width height is smaller than form contentpane s width height you might as well do not scale it since the image will fit the screen

8249329

children	parent
i m just trying to dynamically add children to the parent through a public method

8249363
min	max	minimum	max
if by efficiency you mean minimum comparision to find both max and min i think you can do as below

8249415
public	protected
these are public protected default package access and private constructors

8249415
public	protected
so looking at the docs for both of them i think a difference is that getconstructors returns only public constructors while getdeclaredconstructors returns all the constructors public protected default package access and private

8249448
inherited	properties
i m trying to access private properties on a inherited class

8249450

depending on the nature of your response data either the http 1.1 transfer-encoding chunked feature or various server pushing techniqus can be used in http for the type of situation you describe

8249678
accessor	properties
the whole reason that ruby uses instance variables and accessor methods with syntax sugar to look like you re getting direct access to properties is so that you can refactor your classes and external consumers of your interface

8249694
cifilter	uiimage
the following is an example of how i am generating a filtered uiimage on the iphone using a cifilter

8249701
post	get
in response to your code sample i d like to suggest that you look at using get instead of post for polling since you re not actually changing the state of the system but trying to retrieve information from it i m inferring this from your question since the code seems that you actually are changing the state of the system

8249719
hide	show
i want to hide or show my spinner depending on what is selected in the radio button

8249736
folder	directory
in that actionscript 3.0 directory create a folder named fp11 and download playerglobal.swc from adobe -

8249738
post	put
a post query and i know my request is not rest compliant as the url for the request should point at a specific resource yet i would like to understand better the issue as i think put is the correct verb here i can construct on the client siide the uri for the resource to create

8249741
put	get
by convention methods starting with get have a specific meaning they take a pointer-to-pointer as argument and put a value into that location for the caller s use

versioning	upgrade
either upgrade to xcode 4 you can still target mac os x versioning older than 10.7 or stick to snow leopard

8249878
viewdidload	viewwillappear
or even better push the view controller asap and do its init process in the viewdidload or viewwillappear methods of this controller you can add the activity controller in this new view

8249891
children	parent
i think i m missing a simple concept with valueinjecter and or automapper but how do you deep clone a parent dto.entity to biz.entity and include all children

8249972
width	height
for some reason the size if the window always stays the same size even when i change the width and the height

8249988
versioning	upgrade
1 get the customer to upgrade to a recent versioning of notes domino

8250044
union	distinct
a union will return all distinct records and a union all will return the first record set then the second record set maintaining order

8250060
pull	push
you don t actually have to have separate forks to issue pull requests you can have everyone committing to a single repo and push feature branches to github then click on pull request from feature-1- to master

8250125
width	height
if you are talking about aspect ratio you can do it with just html css but you need some sort of server side processor to determine the correct width height pairs depending on your final output size

8250125
width	height
obviously you need to make sure the height width is not shorter then the div_wrapper otherwise the background will show

8250132
maven	pom.xml
i have a maven multi-module pom.xml which builds a war

8250134
int	chars	int	double

the content of your textview might be pushing out the imageview

8250225

vsto	add-in
i am developing an outlook 2003 add-in using vsto in visualstuido2008

8250287
int	chars
one little thing in order to print your numbers you probably want to print them as int rather than chars so you should change

8250290
post	get
it has to be a normal get link not a post link and for sure not an ajax request if it s a file download

8250296
put	get
use one method for both get and put

8250355
scatter	graphing
i am currently using jfreechart scatter graphing to display a number of points

8250355

when i use the scatter graphing to draw lines it draws them in the wrong order for example the ordered list 2 3 2 5 3 4 is the desired order to be printed

8250397
post	put
it seems natural to put the producer in a stripped down spring-mvc app take the request body from the http request do some validation and post to the queue

8250411
bytearrayinputstream	objectinputstream	fileinputstream	bytearrayinputstream	fileinputstream	objectinputstream
i started by serializing three objects of same type in a file and then reading them using fileinputstream bytearrayinputstream and objectinputstream

8250475
maven	pom.xml
you can verify this behavior yourself by running mvn help effective-pom on one of the child poms the effective-pom goal should give you a fully resolved view of the pom.xml you run it on taking into account inheritance equivalent to what maven will actually use when it runs

8250479
post	get
i am learning both ajax and the java servlet api well spring mvc which is based upon servlets at the same time and believe i am understanding most of the basics except when it comes to understanding how httpservletresponse is structured organized populated differently when the server servlet is responding to an http get post as it would with a normal page request as opposed to an ajax-based xmlhttprequest

8250483
ant	maven
if you are using some kind of build system make maven ant msbuild etc. perhaps you can circumvent the entire problem by placing the library somewhere in the parent git repository and making the build system copy the library to the submodule when building

8250512
post	get
when that post returns with a json result a jquery get request is made to the server

8250515
hash	salt
your website will have a secret salt just a random string preventing to forge the hash

8250515
hash	salt
the hash is salt two times in a row two sha1 calls

8250536
vb.net	vb6
the situation is i m doing a quick port just to bring it up a supported architecture of an old vb6 winforms application it s just a tool really not a full-on app to vb.net using visual studio 2008 s automatic translator over the .net 3.5 framework

8250548
width	height
width and height are variables to be set by the window resizing handler or determined by querying window state

8250587
cgpoint	cgrect
every time you change the frame you will have to scroll to the cgpoint or cgrect you desire

8250607

i specifically put in width and height but apparently i didn t listen.

8250639
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i have been using the following within the standard touchesbegan or touchesmoved though self is a viewcontroller

8250641
firefox	safari
given the fact that it works under safari i assume it is a firefox issue

8250657
vim	emacs
you might be able to build a visual studio plugin with an implementation of this but it isn t a standard solution on any platform besides maybe vi vim or emacs and even then i m not sure

8250660
post	put	post	get	put	get
method string can be get put delete post

8250685
recvfrom	datagram
the only differences for udp i use datagram mode sendto and recvfrom

8250686
post	get
and by the way your example is post not get because you are sending the parameters in the request body instead of the url

8250716
setinterval	settimeout
uses setinterval instead of settimeout for repeated calling although that may not be convenient

8250716
setinterval	settimeout
both setinterval and settimeout return a handle you can save and use to stop the timer if you want but since you didn t ask about that i left it out for simplicity

8250718
setinterval	settimeout
you need setinterval instead of settimeout

8250718
setinterval	settimeout
you shouldn t pass a string to settimeout or setinterval

8250723
google-chrome	firefox
why is the tag displaying incorrectly in google-chrome but not in firefox

8250744

8250778
kate	kde

8250797
width	height
the container is then shifted half the stage width across and half the stage height down positioning the player in the centre of the screen

8250860
disk	ram
rather than base most of the work on reading from disk i propose to shift the accents and do most of the work in-memory but find ways to load data from disk store it in ram work with data and save it on disk in both time and memory - efficient manner

8250860
n-gram	words
the symbols inputlower wordindexrules n-gram here are some symbols i chose to use for the list of words in a file and for hash-tables

8250860
n-gram	words
the main idea here is that we use integer indices instead of words strings which allows us to utilize packed arrays for n-gram

8250889
fgetc	fread
i.e if fread is actually multiple calls to fgetc then why the speed difference

8250895
post	get
this is basically what the standard new and create methods do -- same endpoint but one takes get one post

8250907
fgetc	fread
fread is not calling fgetc to read each byte

8250915
partcover	opencover
opencover and partcover are two opensource tools that should suffice

8250938
maven	pom.xml
i got this error when i also had a nuxeo related dependancy in my maven pom.xml which itself has a dependency on jersey libraries but at an earlier version 1.1.5 to be specific

8250970
innodb	myisam
i tried to run insertion of random data into myisam and innodb tables

8250970
innodb	myisam
myisam needed a few seconds less for inserting 1 million rows than innodb for just 10 thousand

8250973
int	double
so the types dumped are double int and

8250983
gdi	directdraw
is this something that i should avoid using gdi for and maybe using directdraw instead

8251010
nstextview	nspanel
so i am trying to run a nstask in a background thread and display its output in a nstextview that is on a nspanel attached to my window preference pane using readinbackgroundandnotify

8251027
int	double
so the rule of thumb is this - return large objects by reference or pointer and small objects int double etc. by copying them

8251027
getter	setter
and in those cases where you do not have to control access rights to members trough-out your program - simply use structures with public access to members and do not bloat your code with tons of getter and setter

8251040
fadein	fadeout
but i am having an issue with some timing of the jquery fadein fadeout methods

8251040
fadein	fadeout
this is why i was trying to use a function for the fadeout method and make it change the text and execute the fadein only when the fadeout was complete

8251086
temp	tmp
also worth noting is that on my installation tmp in bash mapped to localappdata temp 1 in windows so that s why i m using the latter in my call to winmerge

8251095
folder	dir
each time they upload a new image i would check to see using php if the folder named after their id exists and if so not make a new dir and just put the images in the existent one

8251105
hash	salt
i only want to store a randomly salt hash of user s passwords in my database so as to avoid all passwords being discovered in the case of the database being compromised and a salt per password to avoid pre-computed rainbow tables dictionary attacks

8251105
hash	salt
however in order for the server to re-compute requestdigest it must know password but my server will only have access to a salt hash

8251105
hash	salt
because the salt on it s own is useless without the hash stored in the database and if the database is compromised then the attacker would have access to both the hash and salt anyway

8251109
button	checkbox
but also print the value for button and value for dropdown i only want that print the input type checkbox checked

8251110
urwid	ncurses
am i missing something in urwid or is there a more convenient ncurses module to make such a slider

8251135
submit	submission
using this you can simply submit the form on close of the fancybox or create a button in the fancybox content that submit it to either 1 another page or 2 the submission page via ajax and closes the fancybox

8251138
folder	directory
my main motivation to do this is to recursively create a listing of all directory and subdirectories in a given folder path

8251147

8258074
put	get
however if you are being statefull get put objects to the session scope for example then you need to synchronize that servlet instance s access to said scope synchronized session or serialize the way requests are being treated by the servlet threads

8258074
stateless	stateful
you want to make your thread instance to be prototype scoped and thus have a new instance created each time an injection is needed if you are infact stateful and share data between your threads and you can leave it to the default scope of singleton if that thread s run method is stateless as far as data outside it is concerned

8258077
put	get
when you get to classes this is more important because your variables such as p1.x are going to be private and you won t be able to put them directly in

how can i get the video to fill the width and the height to be proportional

8258326
width	height
be aware that width and height might be swapped depending on device orientation

8258363

be careful too with padding and width height you need to decrease the block size if you add padding cause the padding is included in the width

8258689

8258729
screens	tablet
3.0 and 3.1 were an awkward period where you had to detect the api version screens size and configure your app accordingly supposing your app supports both phones and tablet

8258729
portrait	landscape
this way of thinking does not end up with you as a developer doing too much more work than before - instead of defining a phone layout a tablet layout each with a portrait landscape layout you just define a few layouts that work with different widths

8258731
hide	show
you have to show hide the loader yourself

wan	lan
further edit given that individuals can only access the questionnaire from a seperate website not internal on their lan wan - i m thinking all i can do is have a link for each group of people and simply limit that to the number in the group not control the issue of 10 individual responses or 1 person doing it 10 times.

8259828
getter	setter
internally textfield text is most likely a getter setter since it needs to set a flag to update the text field display also possibly update the html content etc. so when you set it you are effectively calling a function

8259828
getter	setter
this means that textfield.text is implemented as a property getter and setter so if you had to code it you would see something like

post	get
i hope it will work on changing post to get

8260099
boost	stl
i also know i could use a stl pair instead boost array in this case but i want to keep the generated data as similar to the pathfinders data as possible so i don t have to deal with two totally different interfaces the whole time

8260101
mouseleave	mouseenter
the jquery hover method is shorthand for the bind to mouseenter and mouseleave events so there will be one extra function call using hover however there will be almost no difference in performance

8260112
textview	imageview
i recently started programing and when i did a basic imageview and textview shown below

8260144
floating-point	integer
there are two fundamental types of microprocessor instructions integer and floating-point

you could even create a class that inherited from uitableviewcell and stick your own methods properties in there

8260588
n-gram	words
then you start with any n-gram you like and start adding words that would complete last n-1 words of the text built so far to a known n-gram

8260605
rss	feed
i m currently working with a facebook page rss feed and i need to retrieve images on it

opencv	emgucv
i have heard about emgucv opencv wrapper for vs.net

8260723
distance	polygons
algorithm to reduce distance calculations necessary avoiding things like calculating all particles for each other particle or polygons even when they re far away

8260741
client-side	server-side
the only thing i think of that is that you actually never start receiving the file because the server-side doesn t read the command get foobar.txt so the client-side freezes on sending the command

8260759
playstation	wii
used by many movie and game companies in aaa titles on playstation 3 xbox 360 nintendo wii pc and iphone

8260882
portrait	landscape
if the screen height is more then i will load the qml file designed for portrait mode else the landscape mode

8260903
datamapper	activerecord
that s why i favor the datamapper pattern over activerecord ar makes you change you database schema to match your application while dm makes your application fit the database schema

8260943
int	double
i am using a scanner to read strings from the file then converting them to a double or int

8260943
int	double
the reason i am doing this is because it seems like it doesn t read double or int from a text file only strings

8260947
portrait	landscape
the only problem is that the second uiviewcontroller is not displayed in landscape mode but in portrait

8260962
int	chars
when computing the signature and using it you constantly cast between int and chars

8260964
int	double
use filescanner.nextdouble to read double form the user input and filescanner.nextint to read int

8260972
post	get
via get and post

8260978
for-loop	loops
in python 2.6 if you wanted to compact your code a little you could use itertools.product to turn it into a single for-loop but the general efficiency wouldn t change at all - you d still have iterations of loops

8261032
min	max
use min and max in parameters for xrange to omit if in outer loop

8261032
min	max
range_x xrange max 0 x-1 min lh x+2

8261032
min	max
range_y xrange max 0 y-1 min lw y+2

this is assuming that the adding the .open css class show the menu while removing it hide the menu

8261060
gridview	entitydatasource	gridview	detailsview	entitydatasource	detailsview
instead of using plain text boxes with your entitydatasource control i would recommend using a gridview control with a corresponding detailsview control

8261060
gridview	entitydatasource	gridview	detailsview	entitydatasource	detailsview
when you are configuring the entitydatasource controls you will need two one for the gridview and one for the detailsview make sure to check the enable automatic inserts enable automatic updates and enable automatic deletes check boxes in the configure data selection screen of the setup wizard

8261060
gridview	detailsview
you can also just use the detailsview by itself and leave the gridview out

8261060
entitydatasource	detailsview
to do this you ll need to configure the detailsview s entitydatasoruce expression editor for the where clause a bit differently found in the properties list of the entitydatasource control

8261060
gridview	detailsview
it s important to point out that the gridview and detailsview are pretty heavy controls

8261086
awt	swing
i know that swing supports rtl languages however i can only use awt

8261095
pull	push
running git push --force will not force you to pull that is it will skip the check for a common ancestor

8261115
tcpdf	fpdf
html2pdf is a html to pdf converter written in php4 use fpdf and php5 use tcpdf

8261116
tcpdf	fpdf
html2pdf is a html to pdf converter written in php4 use fpdf and php5 use tcpdf

8261133
hash	md5
i m thinking about hashing full path of the file with md5 and indexing this hash field in the database

8261139
hash	md5
md5 from password and store it as hexa number into varchar or char n field - you don t need to care about case sensitivity because hash for a and a is different

8261142
post	get
it was one that neither of you could have found as i made a typo in the form it get s the post data from

8261163
submit	submission
by submission the form via the event target there is not a recursive call to the submit event handler

8261205
innodb	myisam
the standard b+tree indexes that mysql uses will be fine for your purposes just make sure you re using innodb as opposed to myisam to avoid global write locks

8261244
client-side	server-side
but i absolutely love the fact that if i learn javascript i can do both server-side node.js and client-side jquery scripting in one language

8261254
chron	lubridate
there are several other packages such as chron lubridate and gdata that provide date handling functions

8261322
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i wrote a script that works wonders in google-chrome but it does not work in opera and firefox

8261352
octal	decimal
they could be interepreted as octal values so 009 would be interpreted as 10 decimal

8261373
x86	64bit
that error message also means that you are trying to load a 32bit snapin from a 64bit powershell instance or vice-versa. in your case you need to compile your program to target the correct bitness x86

8261409
gtk	xlib
if it helps my wm is metacity and can you integrate gtk with xlib program actually i was developing a basic wm and feels the need for both xlib and gtk doing anything with gtk in my wm simply crashes it

8261536
opera	firefox
how can i replicate this without javascript or jquery in other browsers like ie or firefox or opera

8261612
sproutcore	cappuccino
unfortunatelly i don t know of an library that really helps in building such interfaces - i know jquery ui sencha cappuccino sproutcore and the like but they do not quite fit

8261634
min	max
you could create your own numericwheeladapter that overrides charsequence and instead of generating a value for each index you can do something like index x 15 to get 0 15 30 45 and set min and max to 0 and 3

8261748
hash	md5
there is a slight chance that md5 will produce the same hash for different inputs

8261749
hash	md5
md5 is broken in the sense that it s possible to intentionally generate a hash collision you should probably use the sha family eg sha-256 or sha-2 if you are concerned about someone maliciously creating a file with the same hash as another file

8261749
hash	md5
hash functions have a limited length eg md5 is 128 bits in length so there are 2 128 possible hash

8261777
rss	feed
i am developing a facebook iframe application using php which opens an rss feed from another site and displays a selected item from the feed

8261777
rss	feed
the rss feed if utf-8 encoded however when i display the selected item i get the characters displayed as iso-8859 whatever

8261840
min	max
it revealed each structure should contain three 3 keys one for each column in the table name min max

8261857
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this website loads fine on safari google-chrome firefox

8261864
wmv	flv
vitamio looks pretty good wmv and flv are on their support format list though i ve never used it myself

8261934
octal	binary
just like octal and binary notation is not

8261943
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
homebrew is the new macports which was the new fink

8261946
for-loop	loops
if it is the for-loop then lets say that there was an integer already declared that we could use in the while loops increment that we didn t need to create just for the while loops

8261946
for-loop	loops
would this instance make the while loops a better choice than creating a for-loop

8261980
for-loop	loops
i think compilers are optimized enough these days so it really doesn t makes a difference if you use a for-loop or a while loops

8262032
google-chrome	firefox
you would see that for instance value equals 100 in google-chrome but in firefox for instance that value is defined in pixels 837px for instance

8262035
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i saw that except the firefox browser google-chrome opera and safari shows the search input in the upper right corner 4-5 pixels upper than normal

8262047
post	get
and if you want to send data with get or post you have to use this solution

8262063
octal	hex	octal	decimal
in javascript only decimal and hex are defined as part of the standard while the octal is implementation dependent which would explain why octal parsing is not consistent between the examples you gave

8262063
octal	decimal
you can get rid of octal literals in strict mode but in all browsers i tested parseint still tried to parse an octal instead of decimal

8262103
pascal	delphi
in pascal like languages delphi the loop limits are evaluated only once

8262111
width	height
you can set the scrollview scroll height width ..like this.

8262119
mouseleave	mouseenter
for each one of these buttons i want to handle the mouseenter and mouseleave events to animate the height of the button and do some other interesting stuff

8262122
int	double
however when you use the let expression it only has one number to work off of so it decides 1 is an int and 2.0 is a double

8262126
subclass	abstract-class
you can then subclass with another abstract-class to provide the default implementation that currently exists in measurebase and subclass away from there

8262133
width	height
make sure that your scrollview.contentsize property value is set correctly width and height should be 0

8262156
hide	show
in addition the library also provides all of the native functions such as pinch-to-zoom swiping to navigate and tapping to hide show the navigation arrows and back button

8262158
int	double
so 1 is a constant which can be any numeric type double int etc.

8262164
int	chars
yes cast it to int the way php always does it it will take any number and form the int out of it until it founds any non-numeric chars

8262171
indexof	hasownproperty
if indexof comes from the prototype chain you must use hasownproperty to skip over it

8262259
mouseup	mousedown
if you want to keep doing a task while your finger is down on the button create a new thread in the mousedown event and kill it in the mouseup event

8262267
int	chars
for example in the official documentation i saw i used for an int and i found out that you can specify a chars type with c and float with f by guessing

8262290
width	height
in my opinion the api is borderline paranoid even things like asking for the display dimensions width and height require signing

8262315
swt	swing
jigloo swt swing gui builder for eclipse and websphere - note jigloo is free for non-commercial use but purchase of a professional license is required for commercial use after successfully evaluating jigloo

8262366
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
in case you re restricted to legacy java.util.date and java.util.calendar apis you need to take into account that the timestamps are interpreted in milliseconds not seconds

8262366
java.util.date	simpledateformat
the constructor of java.util.date and finally use simpledateformat to convert a java.util.date to java.lang.string in the desired date format pattern if necessary with a predefined time zone otherwise it would use the system default time zone which is not gmt utc per se and thus the formatted time might be off

8262405
move	drag
you can then move them around using a drag and drop interface allowing you to specify order and organize them hierarchical

8262435
inherited	properties
even if you know that you do not have rows in your database that do not match on any defined inherited codes anyway you have to set up inherited default properties for linq-to-sql

8262450
post	get
if you want to get the checkboxes values on form post then use which key is checkbox name attribute

8262518
scala	typesafe
see scala integrated query as i understand it is scheduled to be integrated in the typesafe stack as scala language integrated connection kit slick

8262521
groupbox	panel
the easiest way would be to put another panel inside the groupbox so that you only have to reset the font once

8262535
xslt	xquery
another option would be to convert your xquery to xqueryx and you can then process this as xml using xquery or xslt to generate an xform or xhtml form

8262567
toolbar	tabs
in one of my tabs i use the navigation controllers default toolbar

8262571
width	height
since your webview has fill_parent on the width and height the progressbar will stay behind the webview.

8262610
hash	md5
in the both cases i d like to use to determine the md5 hash of the file immediately after it is uploaded

8262610
hash	md5
then i ll check the database for any identical md5 hash and if found i simply won t complete the upload

8262610
hash	md5
does the md5 hash of a file in the tmp directory change after moving it to a permanent location

8262622
getter	setter
gcd takes a lot of the burden of multi-threaded code off your shoulders but it s not a panacea against concurrency problems like shared object references and such - those still remain and are hard problems gcd just making it that much easier to fix them like allowing you to create a corresponding serial queue for every shared contended object in your code and refactoring your setter getter methods to use that queue as a concurrency barrier

8262666
hash	md5
but if you compute the md5 including the file s path the hash will certainly change if the file is move to a new path folder

8262666
hash	md5
final remark while it s very very unlikely md5 hash of two different files may be identical

8262678
post	get
can we read http protocol method get post from request in browser helper object

8262760
set	bag
if you want the database itself to order the collection elements use the order-by attribute of set bag or map mappings

8262771
pop-up	dialog
the only flaw i currently see is that the selected time does not appear in the pop-up dialog if you don t specify timeformat

8262772
portrait	landscape
how can i have an xml for a view that is forced to be in landscape mode while the application is in portrait mode

8262773
hash	md5
if you re convinced by all the reasons given here in the answers and decide not to use md5 at all i m still not sure whether you want to or must use hash you can just append something unique for each user and the time of uploading to each file name

8262803
post	get
server it works fine when i am using it myself but when i get it under load with jmeter it starts giving 100 errors from the moment where jmeter tries to post a login

8262803
versioning	upgrade
if rails versioning should be the culprit of course i can upgrade to the latest

8262805
xstream	jackson
xstream registers application xml and text xml perhaps more jackson registers application json and so on

8262810
min	max
if i set the min max i can still zoom the chart

8262827
postgresql	mysql
is postgresql a better option than mysql for partitioning tables by date

8262838
gradle	ivy
if you decide you need full-blown maven repository interoperability then i d suggest emulating what other projects like groovy gradle and scala have done which is to embed ivy

8262889
subtraction	addition
a space followed by a addition operator or subtraction operator

8262890
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome and believe it or not even ie6

8262905
sudoers	passwd
modify etc sudoers to permit your user to work with nginx without being asked for a passwd

8262905
sudo	passwd
open3 lets you interact with the command if it prompts you for additional info so you can type in the sudo passwd when your rake task tries to execute the command

8262924
put	get
whenever i put the smarty line in i get a 500 error

8262934
opera	google-chrome
check in firebug or google-chrome opera javascript console for errors

8262939
folder	directory
i tracked the issue to that qhull.pyd is missing dependent dlls it is saying msvcr90.dll is missing but i have it in my system32 folder but it is lookign for it in the local directory

8262948
vmware	virtualbox
you can use virtualbox or vmware to set up a virtual os complete with network cards

8262949
hide	show
if you re using jquery it has hide and show to do this

8262970
builtin	isinstance
this is tested by using the builtin function isinstance

8262979
pop-up	dialog
when you visit an application profile on fb you can add that application to your page by clicking the add to page link then a pop-up dialog appears

8262979
pop-up	dialog
is there a way i can make it so the users of my application can skip going to the application profile and have the dialog pop-up after clicking a link on the canvas page

8263020
std	ostream
because _1 comes from the boost lambda namespace it ensures that the operators and then from the boost lambda namespace are used rather than an that acts directly on a std ostream

8263053
google-chrome	firefox
tested with google-chrome firefox

8263069
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
like allways in firefox google-chrome safari and opera everything works without a problem

8263091
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
it s supported in google-chrome safari ie and opera

8263099
post	get
1 to get the image for post refer to this call

8263101
client-side	server-side
it would be worth while understanding the difference between server-side php and client-side javascript languages and how why they interact with each other

8263103
stateless	stateful
apparently this a bad design approach anyway because mdbs are inherently stateless so stateful ejbs shouldn t be injected

8263118
vsto	add-in
it is certainly possible to create a vsto add-in that runs on both office 2007 and 2010 but there are some restrictions on the what and how

8263130
cpu	processors
i did configured the build to all processors any cpu x64 x86 but it doesn t work

8263160
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
then you could theoretically plug it into html.actionlink since asp.net-mvc uses typedescriptor which in turn is extensible at runtime

8263191
min	max
it ll be min for earliest not max

8263192
debian	linux
it is a debian gnu linux amazon ec2 instance

8263197
folder	directory
hi guys i notice that the solr installation directory has an executable jar file embedded in the examples folder

8263207
cout	ofstream
cout is an ostream not an ofstream

8263225
udp	tcp
which method is preferable to use for real-time communication between processes within a single machine linux ipc or tcp udp

8263230
cout	ofstream
std cout is not an ofstream so it will not match your overload

8263273
udp	tcp
afaik tcp ip even on localhost is significantly slower than linux pipes or socketpairs so you should avoid tcp ip and probably even udp ip if speed is a major concern

8263444
subtract	add
add or subtract one of 2 28 or 2 28 -1 depending on whether you want the upper or lower bound and the 2 29 -bit is 0 or 1 because of round-to-even

8263463
hide	show
try to hide the cell before it is show in uitableviewdelegate s tableview willdisplaycell forrowatindexpath method

8263464
micro-optimization	benchmarking
i was doing some benchmarking experiments in micro-optimization and i fell upon the idea of testing type casting versus functions that check for specific data type

8263477
flip	slide
the last line here is called but the my attemp to change the initial settings fails - it only destroys the animations flip from one slide to the next without anim and does not change the pause time

8263497
pop-up	dialog
now when my app tries to close the window word pop-up a do you want to save dialog

8263497
pop-up	dialog
all good but it has alerted me to the fact that using sendmessage wm_close to close another app will snag my app if the other app pop-up a modal dialog

8263501
implements	extends
the most suitable cross-browser approach is to use features that are most widely supported and avoid things like extends dom prototypes since there is no requirement for browsers to implements them and some very common browsers don t and employ suitable feature tests where appropriate

8263968
nstableview	nssplitview
i should also note that the nstableview is located inside an nssplitview

8263980
int	chars
those arise when you dump directly on a file the binary representation of int or other types which can vary in size and byte ordering depending on architecture but plain chars s should be safe

8264004
config	ini
also i have my project generator in zend_tool set up to use yaml with sfyaml as my config format so if you use ini or xml you will need to convert appropriately

8264043

the instances of c containing the updated data is transient since i can t imagine there is anyway to modify a persistent instances

8264471
instances	transient
when the transient instances is passed from the front-end to the service layer a session begins and some checks are done to make sure it is a valid operation

8264471
persistent	transient
assuming everything checks out the transient object is supposed to be persistent

8264471
instances	transient
trying to update a entity that exists in the session with a transient instances

8264471

my guess was that it was upset that the persistent instances was a different class than the transient instances

8264471
instances	transient
i tested and when i call .merge on a transient instances of the same class everything works as expected

8264471

you ll need to replace the width height and margin values with whatever your logo size is

8264916
width	height
for example if you want a flexible width and height with fixed margins you would do

8264921

8265015
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
a crash in malloc realloc calloc or free is often a symptom of a bug elsewhere in your program where you have written beyond the bounds of an allocated block and stomped over the housekeeping information used by the memory allocation functions

8265028
realloc	malloc
a realloc of a null pointer is effectively the same as a malloc

8265094
width	height
essentially it uses another wrapper div that has sufficient width height to cover animated surface - on hover it elevates its z-index so that the animated div remains on top

8265144
free	malloc
i ve seen a similar pattern myself in an application that mixed calls to malloc and free as opposed to allocating and deallocating all at once

int	double
getfromlocation double double int is all you need

8265491
trie	dawg
trie doesn t save space as much as directed acyclic word graph dawg does because it shares common node throughout the structure whereas trie doesn t share nodes

8265491
trie	dawg
here is the difference graphically between trie and dawg

8265491
trie	dawg
the strings tap taps top and tops stored in a trie left and a dawg right eow stands for end-of-word

8265491
trie	dawg	trie	tree
the tree on the left side is trie and the tree on the right is dawg

8265491
trie	dawg
trie has duplicate nodes that represent same letter subword while dawg has exactly one node for each letter subword

8265492
put	get
the problem is when i get the rfid data and try to put it in a text field on the data receive event

8265498
trie	tree
to save space when using a trie one can use a compressed trie also known as a patricia trie or radix tree for which one node can represent multiple characters

8265498
trie	tree
in computer science a radix tree also patricia trie or radix trie

8265525
hex	binary
how do i convert binary data to hex value in obj-c

8265608

note that scanner.next returns the next token separated by white spaces the default delimiter so your file data must be formatted that way

8265905
filtering	grouping
the gui should allow for resizing or columns grouping by columns using drag and drop and on the fly filtering

8265913

bottle	flask
they are based on bottle and flask micro frameworks no useless features they give you the flexibility to plugin whatever modules you want

8265983
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to do it with ajax you will need to do a file upload using an iframe or using an xmlhttprequest but transferring files this way is only available in newer browsers at least firefox 3.6 ie9 not sure on google-chrome

8266029
post	put
instead of post update_admin i modified put update_admin

8266035
outputstream	inputstream
update i think it is in some way confusing that we use getinputstream to actually read process output the reason is that initially basic classes outputstream and inputstream were named so relatively to the code that uses them the code you write

8266112
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
the classic unix systems do not support eres with sed solaris 10 aix 6 hp-ux 11

if they select yes then it runs the new intent switching to the form screens haven t yet looked into passing the user input to another class yet

8266119
int	chars
shorts and chars signed and unsigned are upconverted to int in a value-preserving manner and then compared

8266119
unsigned	short
so if an unsigned short were compared to a signed short the result would come out like the c# example

8266131
integer	unsigned
warning comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions

8266135
submit	submission
what i ideally want is to emulate a submit like submission a form not postiing and then redirecting

8266136
unix	solaris
i am not sure how large .bss or stack unix solaris allows i suspect it will depend on how old the computer is

8266167
uiview	subviews
the following uiview subclass is added as a subviews of bookviewcontroller

8266199
implements	extends
the thing that causes the error is probably that your context does not extends implements locationlistener

8266199
implements	extends
remember that if you do the activity that instantiates the viewpagefragment must extends implements locationlistener

8266262
textblock	itemscontrol
it s not at all clear to me why you re trying to avoid two textblock s or how dynamic your data is but you could either just code it as above or look at using an itemscontrol that is bound to a list of words and produces a textblock for each

8266262
textblock	itemscontrol
afraid there s no easy way to produce a single textblock from an itemscontrol though as it adds its children to a panel not an arbitrary element

8266266
audiotrack	audiorecord
so the idea is to use audiorecord to get a stream of audio from the microphone and send this stream over bluetooth to another device in the form of a raw byte array just like i get it from audiorecord and at the same time over bluetooth receive the stream of audio from the other device and play it with audiotrack

8266283
int	boolean
first rewrite dbcheck to return boolean not int

8266299

when you load the data within viewwillappear or viewdidappear then move the code to viewdidload

8266467
post	get
what the previouspage property does is it allows the request information persist through the use of a transfer method and the request information will be the get or post variables

8266478
getter	setter
edit here are some code i omitted some of the details setter getter

8266579
getter	setter
note i have created getter setter for class boy and class girl for implementing unmarshalling

8266653
typedef	struct
can i get around the variable size array declarations from within a thread by defining a typedef struct which has a size variable i can set

8266657
explode	implode
another way is to convert the string to a list of chars explode then you have the option to take the head hd or tail tl and then finally convert it back to a string implode

8266696
put	get
i am not sure how to put this question in this forum any way i am asking and hopefully get some inputs

8266709

one other neat trick i perform an md5 hash over e.tostring and save it in a separate column in the errors table

8266769
subtract	add
i either add or subtract the time zone offset

8266774
getter	setter
the problems seems to be that you have getter and setter and which confuses jaxb because it does not know how to use them to unmarshal the xml

8266840
fullscreen	minimized
we need to ensure this because it s an experimental setup and we want to minimized such hassles as having to change focus to a fullscreen window

8266853
int	boolean
the idea is to get the list of all the attributes of type string int boolean and date

8266874

implements abstract controller with common methods use protected directive and extends from it your real controllers

8266879
width	height
their width and height are explicitly set to 0

8266879
hide	show
also if you are concerned about performance you should check now you see meâ show hide performance 2010-05-04

8266879

google-chrome	firefox
opened application in google-chrome and firefox browser

8266984
getter	setter
caveat this only works for fields with getter and setter

8267228
persistent	transient
while writing hql i considered both persistent and transient properties

8267244
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue	nsurlconnection	nsoperation
however instead of trying to make the indexpath thread-safe through an nsurlconnection i decided to reimplement the whole thing by moving the nsoperationqueue into the uitableviewcontroller code and having the concurrent imageview class be actually a proper subclass of nsoperation since i was using nsoperationinvocation in the first place to try and avoid the full-fledged nsoperation subclass

8267315
primefaces	richfaces
besides at the moment there are a number of frameworks that can add significant value to your jsf projects such as primefaces richfaces etc

8267386
folder	directory
my guess is - in the above case if your dll is bin based code will try to generate a physical path from the bin folder of your virtual directory

8267430
width	height
it may be of some help to know that even if you copy the vector you will copy only the image headers structure containing type width height etc

8267438
packets	multicast
if the loss of these multicast packets is a problem for your system rather than just a mystery that you d like to solve for performance reasons then the system design is wrong

8267446
udp	tcp
however there is no way to ensure 100 of packet are received with udp without the ability to ask for packets to be sent again something tcp does for you

8267463
innodb	myisam
the oracle guys are claiming compared to myisam innodb delivered 35x higher throughput on the read write test

what i understand from your requirement is that you want to create a custom ip core vhdl and then add it as a part a xps microblaze powerpc system where your core should be accessible by the processor c programming

8267530
bison	jison
i just saw that the grammar you re looking at is a jison grammar which is more or less a bison implementation in javascript

8267530
bison	jison
but bison and therefor jison generates lr parsers while antlr generates ll parsers

8267531
int	boolean
it may be the case that the underlying data lends itself to a specific optimization - for instance if you can create a custom indexing scheme based on bitmasks to create int and using those int to access data using boolean operators you may be able to beat the performance of an rdbms index

8267538
centos	linux
amazon s linux ami is most closely related to centos a red hat variant

8267581
google-chrome	firefox

8267733
children	parent
the parent cell will either be deleted or the object inside will have its quantity and children reduced

8267733
children	parent
the parent shouldn t be deleted since only 2 of its 4 children are selected

8267817
getter	setter
the last resort would perhaps be defining getter setter for those properties

8267836
pop-up	dialog
then when the service goes offline a event will be triggered and i need to pop-up a frmmydialog but when using .showdialog it dialog will be placed behind forms so the parent owner most be found and set like this

8267846
hide	show
so i know you could use show and hide of jquery during onbegin and oncomplete events of ajax calls to approach the ajax preloader effect

8267862
persistent	transient
the transient keyword has nothing to do with persistent only with binary serialization of the object

8267906

how do i get max to occupy a square solely for the purpose of preventing min from getting the square

8275923
min	max
the problem - of course - is that if max picks b then min will perform action a since that square is still available and thus min will win

i need to get max to realize the value of picking action a in state a to prevent min from getting -inf in the next move

8277393
folder	directory
it would be better for you to copy the db to the library or document directory and make all the process from the locally saved database in document or library folder

getter	setter
first think i came up with was to create global singleton sharing all windows references and encapsulate them in getter setter and each windows would have only reference to that let s say window manager - but generally i don t like that type of programming i m anti-global p i consider it s bad and unsafe

if it is a prude player that only allows flv files you can always program your .htaccess file to parse .flv files as php script in the specific folder only and rename your .php file as .flv and try your luck ...anyways...also generate a hash key...perhaps you can take the servers current time and append it to a salt value such as another key known by both scripts and encrypt this final concatenation with your secret key

8278634
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
this seems easier to me than going to gridbaglayout or even boxlayout

8278690
fflush	gets
the third reason is to work around special cases where the normal least recently used eviction policy of caches leads to problems like cache pollution where there s much better ways of fixing avoiding these problems prevent the unnecessary data from being cached or fflush it soon after it gets into the cache

inherited	subclassing
one of the foundation principles of oop is that if a class is a subclassing of another class then that class gets all the functionality of the class it inherited from

8278949
superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing didn t have all the functionality of its superclass you couldn t do that

8278949
superclass	subclassing
you d implement that kind of functionality with an abstract superclass that defines how you interface with payment gateways in general then you d create a subclassing for each payment gateway you want to use paypal sagepay whatever

8278949
inherited	subclassing
as all these subclassing inherited from the same base class you can be certain that they all implement certain methods and you can send messages to those methods without worry

8278949
superclass	subclassing
if one of the subclassing was able to not implement something from the abstract superclass then you couldn t be sure that sending a particular message to a subclassing would work or throw an exception

8278949
superclass	subclassing
if you really must remove functionality from a subclassing you can do it by overriding the superclass method and replacing it with an empty method one that does nothing

8278949
superclass	subclassing
generally if you run into situations where you have functionality in a superclass that you don t need in a subclassing it s a code smell that s telling you that you might need to rethink your design

here you are creating invaderrow times invadercol count invaders i assume 4 and 10 respectively but storing only in an invadercol sized arrays so each iteration of the outer for-loop will override the result of the previous iteration

8279265
int	chars
this cannot be done as you describe because switch can only be used with bool chars string int enum or a corresponding nullable type

8279285
jboss	glassfish
you should refer to server s tomcat glassfish jboss etc documentation in order to configure your http network listeners

ienumerable	ilist
i ve noticed a performance hit of iterating over a primitive collection t that has been cast to a generic interface collection ilist or ienumerable

8280377
ienumerable	ilist
the above code executes significantly faster than the code below where the parameter is changed to type ilist or ienumerable

8280377

superclass	subclassing
so when your subclassing is asked to loadview you get your superclass implementation which overrides the normal nib loading mechanism

8280415
superclass	subclassing
your superclass behavior is quite different from what you want your subclassing to do

8280415
superclass	subclassing
this implements a loadview for your subclassing that skips over the loadview of your superclass and calls the default implementation instead

8280474
memcached	apc
i know in production i should go for apc or memcached to speed up things but it looks strange to me it takes so much time

if i am dragging the li that has the link top links i want to drag not only the words top links but also the div#admin ul and li that are children of that parent li

the way computers generate random numbers is a set number of bits at a time so if the max weren t 2 n - 1 either not all numbers in the range could be returned or entropy would be wasted

8283673
post	get
should you use curl to get data from local urls that use post data

8283683
post	get
you should probably post the smallest complete piece of code you can get which has the problem -- that way people can actually run your code and reproduce the issue for themselves

8283717
decltype	auto
i ve found auto decltype range based for work in a cross platform project llvm for macosx ios gcc linux msvc 10 windows

division	addition
if size is relatively small it doesn t surprise me at all that a call to a prng an integer division and a float division and addition would increase program execution that much

8283962
for-loop	arrays
also note that you never check if target is valid before using it as an arrays index if it ever makes it out of the for-loop still set to -1 all bets are off for your program

8284453
width	height
which will render the image at the specified width and height by

8284453
width	height
the width or height is a negative number then a value is substituted

8284493
getter	setter
if you do not use any getter and setter it is just a matter of taste

8284493
getter	setter
if you do use getter and setter you can expicitely use the private field if you do not want to use the getter setter code in the constructor

8284493
getter	setter
if your getter and setter are virtual even if the default implementation is just an assignment you d have to check the solid principles and ensure that you follow at least liskov substitution and open close principles

8284499
websphere	ibm
im currently looking into the difference between ibm websphere application server and ibm websphere process server

8284538
awt	swing
since that s allowed from jdk1.6_0_12 i still highly recommend don t mixing awt with swing in the one swing container for any reasons what there exists

8284580
pop-up	dialog
when trying to access the service via visual studio we receive the pop-up dialog to enter credentials discovery credentials and it will not authenticate but we are able to retrieve the list of services

8284582
width	height
of note it seemed that when i reset the height of the sections i also had to set the width again too

8284622
datediff	difference
the datediff function allows to find out the dates difference between the two dates

8284762
mdpi	hdpi
this is consistent with the fact that the application takes the drawable resources in my mdpi folder and not in my hdpi folder

8284846
google-chrome	firefox
this works flawlessly on firefox but on google-chrome the background is just black

8284887
int	chars
for instance a string is a of seq chars if you map with a function from chars to chars you get a string but if you map from collection to say int the result cannot be a string and it will just be a seq

8284892
ceil	floor
also you are mixing array indices n i with the contents of the array ceil floor

8284931
width	height
the width of all images is correct - but the height of the imageview parent layout linearlayout is greater then the images

8284935
onkeyup	onkeydown
if you want an event that will be triggered as the user types in an input field you can use onkeypress onkeydown or onkeyup events

8284941
ceil	floor
you re recursively calling your binarysum method with it s third parameter as ceil 2 and floor 2 which will never change

8284941
ceil	floor
ceil 2 is 0 and floor 2 is 50000 neither of these is 1 so you re getting infinite recursion

8284979
for-loop	arrays
do a for-loop over the entire arrays and check if the name of one of the elements is equal with what you re trying to add

8285044
profiling	instrumentation
in allocation profiling instrumentation i see that the cycle a- b- a- b makes the memory growing because first b was not really removed from the memory stack

8285052
free	malloc
so if you have an objc object that malloc s up some memory and points a char at it and the dealloc method calls free that memory will still get properly disposed of

8285064
fadein	fadeout
if you want the fadein and fadeout to happen at the same time you need to take the fadein out of the success callback and put it parallel to the fadout function

8285070
children	parent
children lists as it is typical for lists are opened and closed inside it s parent element

8285071

8285071
idictionary	iequalitycomparer
you can however easily recreate a dictionary with the same items and the appropriate comparer through the dictionary idictionary dictionary iequalitycomparer comparer constructor overload

8285093
cos	sin
1 cos and sin produce values between 0 and 1 so you should probably multiply it by some radius

8285096
width	height
i thought rollone.width would return the width but it only returns 0 the same goes for height

8285110
apache	nginx
apache nginx wsgi

8285214
width	height
in order to extract the resolution width x height you will have to identify pes start with pusi packet and then start parsing the es headers

8285224
range	minimum
assuming you ve got the absolute minimum and the absolute maximum value vmin and vmax and you d like to scale the whole range to 0

8285224
range	minimum
mod_add will move negative numbers values to the positive range where the absolute minimum will become 0 and mod_mul will scale the whole range from absolute minimum to absolute maximum to fit into 0

8285243
mamp	wamp
actually i have to access it on my localhost with wamp or mamp

i have already made a function of multiplication of long numbers addition of long numbers subtraction of long numbers and division of long numbers

8285534
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
concerning the getintrinsic height|width methods they return the actual size of your underlying bitmap which may be different if the system resized it it while loading it an hdpi image loaded on an mdpi screens for instance

8285559
google-chrome	firefox
the script works fine in google-chrome and firefox however the script is not actioned in explorer

8285560
division	modulo
because the digits have a larger range you will need fewer memory and fewer modulo and division operations

8285560
division	modulo
additionally with the base being a power of 2 the modulo and division operations are much faster than with your base-10 approach

8285575
inherited	properties
newly created instance inherited properties from the prototype properties of the constructor function object

8285592

8285776
jobs	cron
i m trying to set up the cron jobs for my codigniter application however when i run the cron it throws me memcached errors

8285798
width	height
if you are talking about doing per-pixel manipulation on the image you need to use .getimagedata x y width height this gives you and object that contains the .data field which is an array of every pixel s rgba of the image so is the first pixel s r channel is the g channel the b the alpha channel and then is the r channel of the second pixel

8285810
keyevent	onkeydown
make sure onkeydown is used from the gallery after a time job for example gallery.onkeydown keyevent.keycode_dpad_right new keyevent 0 0

8285831
post	put
the thing is now that he is trying to send necessary attributes to me with a post request but without the use of a nested hash which means that that all attributes will be directly put in params and not in a subhash

8285841
free	malloc
you do not need to free memory which you did not allocate with malloc

8285841
free	malloc
in your example string is not allocated by malloc in your program so you do not need to free it

8285841
calloc	malloc
the argument does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or

8285841
free	realloc
realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc

8285845
free	malloc
you only need to free what you ve allocated dynamically via malloc in c or via keyword new in c++

8285845
free	malloc
basically for any allocation call like malloc there should be a free somewhere

8285859
backgrounding	multitasking
maybe you opted out on the multitasking thing with the uiapplicationexitsonsuspend key in your plist or your app is crashing when going to the backgrounding using too much memory to be backgrounding

8285906
width	height
you can also make a class of your own that will ignore the original width and height

8285921
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the video works when clicked in safari but it doesn t work when clicked in firefox ie and google-chrome

8285979
addclass	removeclass

8286031
width	height
width and height of the resulting stringâ s bounding box

8286056
post	put
and i had a further 3 columns which were labelled top3_1 top3_2 top3_3 to put each of their interests in from a post form

8286076
decoder	encoder
later on when decoder plays it it does two things - one ensures that decoder s own clock is enslaved with encoder s clock and two it ensures that every picture is presented on the screen and audio frame presented to speaker exactly when that respective time occurs

8286076
decoder	encoder
now the major concern remains is that decoder s clock needs to remain in control synchronization of encoder s clock

8286078
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
use a standard ios view controller manager like uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller to display your views

8286084
multiplying	multiplication
application note ap-930 streaming simd extensions - matrix multiplication describes in detail the algorithm for multiplying two 6ã 6 matrices

8286123
prepare	execute
both queries will return the same result so why using the prepare for me it looks like it s gonna be slower since you have to execute an extra step

8286137
mef	prism
i ve been comparing unity and mef to be used in prism and was going towards mef

8286178
charindex	substr

8286234
post	get
you can get list of post liked an user order by add_date desc easily

8286234
post	get
or vice versus to get list of users liked a post order by add_date desc

8286359
ant	maven
unfortunately the software is not build by maven but by ant so i can not find the stuff in an artifactory or something similar

8286360
post	get
i am trying to get an inline like button for each post on the homepage of tumblr s blogs like the one similar to

8286362
post	get
all request data url post get ... are stored in request variable

8286362
post	get
in this case none of controllers can access post get or other request variables directly

8286381
hash	md5
a simple solution would be not to include the address but a md5 hash of the address into the form

8286381
post	get
in fact my recently updated internal framework never passes any parameters as get or post parameters from request to request

8286389
google-chrome	firefox
the script works fine in google-chrome and firefox however the script is not actioned in explorer

8286425
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers only safari google-chrome

8286429
winpcap	pcap.net
there is a library called pcap.net that is a wrapper for a native library that allows you to do this called winpcap

8286458
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i ve only just started with storyboards and have found that i had to set string properties on the destination view controller instead then update the ui components in viewdidload or viewwillappear

8286459
getter	setter
you could even move the specializations to the container the getter setter becomes generically

8286502
margin	height
i found the general answer here css 100 height with padding margin

8286532
hide	show
i need to create specific tableviewcell which show a special subview on first touch and hide it on second touch that subview contains some labels or buttons

8286618
integer	unsigned
don t forget that a hashcode in java needs to return an integer anyways so the lack of an unsigned long should not make a difference - there will just be fewer possible values that the function takes on

8286675
children	parent
this selects all children of the top element that are named parent have only one child element except the name child and the string value of their name child is the same as the string value of the name child of their other non- name child

8286723
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
however if you are merely interested in the basic algorithm used rather than the details pypy s implementations could be a guide at a quick glance it looks to be doing basically the same thing as both cpython and jython

8286723
cpython	pypy
as a general resource though there s no reason to think that pypy s implementation of all string functions would mirror the algorithms used in cpython -- pypy is after all intended as an optimized version of python running in a jit and this may have significant impact on what the most reasonable implementation of a method is especially string functions which frequently can be performance bottlenecks and which the implementors of an optimized runtime therefore have incentive to optimize

8286726
implements	extends
the definition means that s is a type that extends or implements charsequence

8286726
implements	extends
this means that foo returns a type that either extends or implements charsequence and accepts an argument of the same type

8286741
hide	show
i want from a button push to show it and from a text change in the textbox to hide it

8286741

8286785
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the user tested the application with google-chrome firefox ie and safari in windows7

8286794
zoo	xts
then use an aggregation routine and e.g the zoo and xts packages have these for time-indexed structures or ddply does it more generally or you can use base r functions

8286858
public	protected
if not you have 3 alternatives recode the class set the vars public recode the class and add the methods or recode the class and set the variables protected then create a new class extending the parent one with those methods i recomend this one since it has less impact on the parent class

8286896
children	parent
your setlevel method is not correct since it relies on a particular enumeration order for its correctness - parent must be processed before their children

8286914
oncreate	setcontentview
however if you desire you can customize the screen layout by setting your own view layout with setcontentview in oncreate

8286915
yacc	bison
also yacc or bison is the definitive way of building fsm parsers

8286921
next	except
the next example is very similar except now i bind to a list of type country where country is a class with an id possibly from a database and a name

8286983
width	margin
make vertical bar of inner scroll viewer visible and set right margin on header which is equal to width of vertical scroll bar

8286985
jtextfield	jtable
i already can filter the jtable using a jtextfield the problem is that is case sensitive

8287048
width	margin
a in an inline element give is display block so width margin padding etc can be applied

8287056
implements	extends
in your activity that extends tabactivity you could implements tab listener on change action like

8287093
move	drag
it has one big problem that need to be addressed it stores the x y coordinates are screen-based and not form based so if you drag once move the entire form and drag again it will get funky

8287114
subtract	add
when it got above the size of a tile we would reset it to zero and add or subtract to the corrosponding tile type

8287132
google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way to do this is to use a web development tool such as firebug in firefox or the ones that come bundled with ie 6 i think and google-chrome

8287135
strdup	strncpy	strdup	malloc	strncpy	malloc
i don t like using strdup being it is not standard c so i ll stick with malloc and strncpy

8287135
put	get
takes in a parameter so if i put a string literal in when calling it i would get an error

8287135
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
but again in string_ton i use calloc and malloc how would i free this memory and still be able to use ton

8287162
free	malloc
alternatively using the boehm s garbage collector is extremely useful you can use gc_malloc instead of malloc etc... and don t bother calling free or gc_free

8287175
put	get
i can get round this by manually changing the references in the javascript but what if i want to put this content into a different placeholder

8287186
client-side	server-side
in general your server-side c# code will respond to interactions initiated by your client-side code

8287227
ostringstream	std
the expression std ostringstream creates a temporary and which takes as argument is a free function but this free function cannot be called on a temporary as the type of the first parameter of the function is which cannot be bound to temporary object

8287227
ostringstream	std
that is std ostringstream .flush returns which means now the free function can called passing the returned reference as first argument

8287249
pop-up	dialog
whenever the application is run and closed windows pop-up a product compatibility assistant dialog saying the application may not have installed correctly

8287256
folder	directory
apparently windows 7 will just not show start folder after you get so many in your all users directory

8287269
fadein	fadeout
in snippet i used fadein fadeout which adds nice fade effect

8287300
getter	setter
simply have the form expose a property of type settings with a getter and a setter

8287323
stdout	fflush
as it receives the command it fflush and all the answers appears on the stdout just before exiting

8287343
versioning	upgrade
but i m not sure if i can do subscriptions model for a upgrade versioning on app store

8287352
post	get
how can i send the request to the server without posting the facebook id as a post get parameter

8287409

8287438
required	placeholder
all this required is a placeholder for the url beginning

8287448
hash	md5
whenever i hash a name of a file with md5 the file was just uploaded and given a md5 hash name the hexadecimal representation of the hash always starts with a number

8287468
hash	md5
the md5 can only be hexadecimal 32 digits 0-9 a-f the hash is not part of it

8287584
hide	show
how do i hide the title bar while my application is loading so that there will be no hint of it and then show it afterwards

8287594
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
i d also recommend using settimeout rather than setinterval clearinterval since it doesn t need to be run on a recurring basis

8287615
bindparam	bindvalue
or you could use bindvalue instead of bindparam if you re using pdo

8287641
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
for firefox and opera everything is perfect but google-chrome on safari still have one issue

8287643
ready	each
all the js files will be loaded on each page and every on ready

8287644
google-chrome	firefox
well for one there are several versions of jquery some plugins aren t compatible with newer versions also if lets say firefox did implement this they would have to download jquery each time there s an update there s no guarantee that google-chrome and other browsers would follow up on this for example internet explorer that doesnt seem to like anything new so you would still have to reference it for the browsers that does not support it

8287674
salt	md5
even storing the md5 of the password and a salt is not sufficient

8287703
integer	unsigned
the integer value in d is converted to an unsigned value which on a 2 s complement architecture ends up being 0xffffffff or similar

8287706
int	chars
if your class attributes were simple types int float chars â even arrays of such types you could save them in a compound datatype

8287706
boost	stl
if you have stl containers you d probably better use boost serialization

8287709
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
we have css3 transition support today in all popular versions of firefox google-chrome opera and safari but not in any version of ie yet

8287719
mp4	h.264
ffmpeg can encode yuv to mp4 h.264 via libx264 encoder

8287741
oncreate	setcontentview
best place is probably in oncreate before setcontentview where you would otherwise request window features.

8287777
google-chrome	firefox
firefox correctly traces errors to offending code but sometimes google-chrome encounters errors that firefox does not and it is extremely hard to find what is broken in these instances as i m dealing with 5 different scripts and 3000 lines of code

8287787
bluetooth	usb
i ve built a buildroot linux image for my phidgetsbc and included bluetooth support unfortunately it appears my bluetooth usb dongle isn t working

8287853
width	height
can anyone offer a suggestion to how i can have the text widget self adjust its height to fit all of the entered text but keep the width of the text widget always fixed at a prescribed value

8287887
calloc	malloc
alternatively you can just call calloc 3 instead of malloc which automatically zeroes out the returned memory for you upon success

8287904
int	double
you can not forward arbitrary type conversions forward an int as a double

8287988
width	height
most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jquery functionality for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be unless the jquery.color plugin is used

8288009
bower	npm
as of today 31 march 2017 there are a lot of different package managers and or tools you could use to manage front-end libraries npm bower rollup etc. but i currently found yarn and webpack 2 most interesting

8288288
ant	maven
you could use an ant task to create this jar either before you run maven or as part of your maven build

8288288
ant	maven
note if you create the jar in maven via ant then you should create the jar in target so that it gets cleaned correctly

8288288
ant	maven
to use an ant build file from maven you can use the maven antrun plugin similarly to

8288307
uilabel	nsstring
for a single-line uitextfield you should be able to measure the size of the nsstring it has a measurement function in there somewhere and move a uilabel to the right position

8288337
qstring	qdir
i was just thinking about using boost filesystem library for the same task but - since my application uses both qt and boost libraries i decided to use qt which does this task with one simple method qstring qdir relativefilepath const qstring filename

put	get
the reason of that error is that by default colorbox plugin fetch content of referenced page with async get request and put it into dialog container

8293845

and the last but not the least solution is to show pop-up page with using inline frame in dialog element container with passing iframe true option to colorbox plugin

8293852
onresume	onpause
and pause or resume the thread on onpause or onresume event respectively

8293852
onresume	onpause
for that you need to override onpause - and onresume

8293852
onresume	onpause
i mean that you want to detect the onpause and onresume events in library class and let other user use it

8293863
width	height
i m not too sure about the size of the indicator setting the indicator bounds can affect the width of the indicator but not the height

8293879

8294010
public	protected
you should test only public interface and ensure that it behaves as expected you should not care details of implementation like private protected

8294010
public	protected
sometimes when writing unit tests for legacy code which you not able to change you could be forced to access protected members in this case solution could be creating a wrapper which exposes internal public property method to access protected one

8294021

this setup works fine in ios 4 the ios 4 implementation of dismissmodalviewcontrolleranimated calls uiwindow s _setrotatableclient toorientation updatestatusbar duration force which calls willrotatetointerfaceorientation duration for the switched in uiviewcontroller

submit	submission
so if i had 20 empty rows in the table because i stated in the spinner i wanted 20 questions then what happens is everytime i submit a question it adds a new row everytime so submission 20 questions from the textarea would mean the table would contain 20 blank rows and 20 rows with questions

nsoperation	nsblockoperation	nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
d somehow using some classes such as nsoperation nsblockoperation or nsoperationqueue though not sure how exactly to do it some example would be appreciated

8295017
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
update2 already had some experience with nsinvocationoperation and nsoperationqueue and imho it s quite convenient

8295017
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
nsoperationqueue determines how much parallel threads it need to perform the calls nsinvocationoperation and handles it for you

8295017
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
also if you want to perform your method calls each wrapped in separate nsinvocationoperation in a strict queue then you can add dependencies and so nsoperationqueue will preserve method call order

on show glass button glass panel is show with gif image and a hide glass button in it and with that memory will be started increasing

8295161
pop-up	dialog
as a potentially more elegant alternative or may be just in case your carrier is indeed crude enough to pop-up an actual modal dialog every time a text is sent it may be that your carrier is using a broadcast receiver to trigger those notifications or those dialog so if that s the case and hopefully the carrier isn t using 100 as a priority for its receiver it may be possible for you to register a receiver with 100 and then kill the broadcast before it propagates to the other receivers

profiling	instrumentation
it seems that resizing the window which causes the resize of two catextlayer s so that they fit the root layer s width and the repositioning of one catextlayer so that it stays right-aligned is causing the application to spend most of its time executing the cgsscanconvolveandintegratergb function i have used the time profiling instrumentation

8295406
superclass	subclassing
subclassing constructor should call superclass constructor manually by special construct apply or call like this

however it would be very convenient for them to vote straight from the rss feed since most of them read the posts from it

8295925

this could be acheived by inserting hyperlinks into rss feed items which would point to pages that would register the votes

8299007
for-loop	arrays
use an arrays and a for-loop and make a tab object containing those members

8299007
width	height
i m not sure of the specific javascript syntax but basically rather than tab1 tab2 tab3 etc you have an array or list of tabs tab names tab width tab height tab buttons

8299272

the properties first and second have a private setter and a public getter

getter	setter
if you specify an access modifier on a getter or setter it must be more restrictive than the access modifier for the property and you can t specify an access modifier on both properties

8299272
