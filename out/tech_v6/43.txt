for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
so i thought i just needed to do something like that in a for-loop that loops once for every element in the arrays and increments counter

4900160
ienumerable	ilist
you cannot read from an ienumerable in a parallel fashion but you can from an ilist using indexes

4900206
listview	gridview
try to use listview instead of gridview if that would be an option for you

4900229
getter	setter
for every table in db i have model class that has appropriate getter and setter and some mandatory methods

4900229
getter	setter
problem is that in runtime genericdao class doesn t know whitch model object it gets and what methods getter and setter exist in it so i need to call mandatory model class method that retrieves list of attributes as multiple string array

4900316
width	height
is there a good approach in silverlight to getting the width in pixels at the moment height isn t important besides making a call to the server

4900344
folder	directory
in this case you may have to scan the directory structure and have your code make an educated guess as to the correct folder

objectdatasource	entitydatasource
it doesn t appear you are binding the datagrid to a control like objectdatasource entitydatasource which would automatically take care of the paging for you

4900553
unix	aix
when this program is run on aix unix 6.1 why is the output

4900577
google-chrome	safari
that should properly render the menu control in google-chrome safari

4900599
ienumerable	iqueryable
that takes an iqueryable and returns an ienumerable which behind the scenes forces the evaluation of the expression tree by the linq provider

4900649
google-chrome	firefox
then i d open up google-chrome developer tools or firebug in firefox and use the element inspector

4900656
google-chrome	firefox
as of july 2017 fillrect is 5-6ã faster on firefox v54 and google-chrome v59 win7x64

currently i have many other elements working properly but still lack the knowledge needed to hide or show certain columns within the table and having it resize properly

4900919
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
additionally if you call malloc calloc realloc etc. you need to use free to deallocate the memory when done

4900924
pull	push
a list would probably be better for you - push to the front pull off the end

4900925

missing the namespace in the inherited properties if you are not using one than this does not apply

4901120
gridview	repeater
am fairly new to asp.net so not sure if i should be using a gridview datagrid repeater or what

4901143
gridview	repeater
you surely can use a repeater but if you identify the structure of the data as a grid meaning that you plan or may plan to add new columns in the future for example a gridview is probably the best

this is often done to perform efficient bulk copy of data either to and from a file or with memcpy memmove

4901219
getter	setter
i also provided the setter and getter in uibasebean

4901224
inherited	subclassing
as joe mentioned in his comment normal private variables are typically just named with a single underscore the double underscore mangles it so inherited can work without name clashes in subclassing

4901460
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
i need the jscrollpane to be able to display the jlayedpane by clicking the arrows and what not if the jpanel and jscrollpane are not large enough to show the entire jlayeredpane

4901460
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
the problem is that with the code below the jlayeredpane always expands to fit the size of the jscrollpane and in the event that the jscrollpane is smaller than the jlayeredpane it does not provide the scrolling ability

4901471
chm	rtf
it can convert from chm to pdf as well as to from epub ebook lit mobi rtf fb2 etc

i have a small c program on routers a and c that sends a very small packets over udp to the opposite router and i use pcap to detect the times that the packets was sent and the times it arrived at the other end and calculate the average and deviation for a thousand of these tests

4901510
jscrollpane	jlayeredpane
to solve your problem you could add the jlayeredpane to a jpanel and then add this jpanel as the view of the jscrollpane after having set the correct insets of the layered pane so that it stays in middle as you want

4901545
switching	screens
it s conceivable that the super user would want to return to the impersonation screens to switching context and impersonate another user

last week i had released a versioning of a wordpress plugin that works if the user was doing a fresh install however if they already had the plugin and upgrade it using the wordpress upgrade automatically feature problems occurred and some of the database elements were erased

4902143
int	chars
you re passing in an nsstring which is getting reinterpreted as an int chars

4902143
int	chars
since the string can be stored at a different address in memory each time you run you get that address as an int which is why you get a different chinese chars every time you run your code

4902143
int	chars
just pass in the chars as an int

4902232
stdout	fflush
try inserting a fflush stdout right after your printf a

pandas	pytables
other tools you might look at are pytables and the related package carray larry datarray pandas and tabular

4902251
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
i ended up simulating this behavior by attaching event handlers to mouseup mousedown and mouseover events

4902251
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
i use mouseup and mousedown to control whether it s selecting or not and the actual selection happens in mouseover

4902253
folder	directory
the folder is actually directory background you have to add the empty string value of noworkingdirectory into it and the 1 in the command becomes a v

inherited	subclassing
short answer instance variables don t get inherited by subclassing

4902369

it allows for the sort of thing you re trying to do defining an attribute on a parent class that can get inherited and overidden in its subclassing

4902430
next	except
ok here is my updated code which works now except the fading doesnt work the image just flips to the next one and doesn t fade smoothly anymore

4902437
width	height
this gives you the vector x_min y_min width height

4902478
hash	md5
my first idea is to add a hash field to the table probably md5 pull the hash list at the beginning of each run check for duplicates before inserting into the db

4902494
xna	spritebatch
i m using xna to visualize some data and i m trying to use billboards for data and spritebatch for hud text drawing

4902510
put	get
however beware that if you put a strong-named assembly in the bin folder and an assembly with the same strong name exists in the gac then the assembly in the gac will get loaded

4902526
formview	detailsview
i know i can use a detailsview to get a table rendered out but i end up modifying the form so much that i prefer to use the formview

4902555
post	get
i have read all the post and seen how to create a partial class and explicitly set timeout values and i have done exactly that but i still get timed out after one minute

4902579
put	get
edit i have just discovered that if i remove the custom style that i put on the repeatbutton i get the default hover effect

4902588
width	height
the function is intended for wordpress so takes the post- id argument the custom field name width and height of the intended target

4902591
memcpy	strcpy
sample memcpy c implementation as you can see it is quite similar to strcpy

4902630
free	malloc
you can free anything you have created with malloc anywhere in the program

4902630
free	malloc
memory allocated with malloc comes from the heap section of memory and will persist throughout the lifetime of a program unless released with free

4902642
free	malloc
it is not necessary to call malloc and free in the same function but i have some remarks on your code

4902715
int	boolean
compiles under c++ but is always false true is int constant 0x74727565 and boolean equals 0 false or 1 true

4902735
client-side	server-side
i always put the validation on the server-side at a minimum as client-side logic is ultimately unreliable what happens if someone disables javascript

4902779
sorting	filtering
jtable sorting filtering feature

4902786
fieldset	formpanel
i have a formpanel with several textfield items and a fieldset that contains a combobox and a button

i m using google forms a google doc spreadsheet with an automatically generated form that the user can fill in to submit their details and would like to track the submission of the form as a virtual pageview in google analytics so that i can measure conversions

4902821
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade your workstations to 2010 then the runtime libraries are likely still there from a previous versioning note that multiple versioning of vs run concurrently on the same machine just fine

4902837
disk	ram
this looks good you have 1300mb cached data + indexes which means your queries are hitting ram not disk

4902901
int	chars
i would like chars short and int types to be 1 2 and 4 bytes width

4902920
pull	push
all devs pull from and push to central repo as you are doing now

4903016
opencv	emgucv

4903043
mouse	keyboard
no reactions on keyboard no mouse cursor seen or itâ s seen but is not responsibe to mouse movements â this i do not know

4903064
polymorphism	specialization
due to the nature of polymorphism and specialization upper bounds are far more useful than lower bounds as described by the faq access to non-static members and type erasure

4903077
filtering	grouping
current is added to the items that are grouping in your current selector shown is added to current items that are not filtering out

4903134
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the techniques described by tom and michael work great in ie firefox and opera and almost work in google-chrome and safari

4903175
google-chrome	safari
the problem is in google-chrome and safari no cssrules property is created for the style sheet

4903175
google-chrome	safari
can anyone explain how to create a style sheet for an iframe that ll give me a cssrules property in google-chrome and safari

4903179
stdout	stderr
this will set stdout stderr encoding to utf-8 meaning you can print all unicode characters

4903183
rsa	dsa
note that for this price you get quite extensive functionality that covers pkcs#1 and pkcs#7 signing and encryption using rsa dsa signing only and elliptic curves as well as symmetric encryption extensive certificate support and much more

4903198
google-chrome	firefox
in that case i want to index a page which will be prompting the user to download either firefox or google-chrome in order to view the site

4903274
postgresql	mysql
it doesn t take too much effort to get up and running with a local mysql or postgresql server and you ll avoid some nasty surprises by doing all of your development and testing on the same backend you ll be using once you push to production

4903290
ubuntu	linux
i have linux ubuntu 10.10 and when i run the below in a terminal

4903323
mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
here is a snippet from a site that has a few buttons that have mouseover mouseup mousedown and hover states

4903395
xslt	xquery
manipulation such as xslt xquery and

4903400
icmp	udp	tunnel	traceroute
ping and traceroute make use of lower layer network protocols icmp and or udp in particular which are layer 4 protocols and will not work over an http layer 7 tunnel

4903400
tunnel	packets
in any case even if you could convince the http proxy to open a raw tcp session for you which is how some http tunnel works you would not receive the necessary packets to confirm that the host is reachable

4903400
traceroute	packets
icmp echo reply in the case of ping or the time-to-live expired icmp packets in the case of traceroute

4903411
postgresql	mysql
explicit support for popular apis such as linq-to-sql entity framework and odata and databases such as sql azure sqlite mysql oracle and postgresql

4903469
width	height
indeed inner div will have top left of outer div as root coordinates the problem is laying down in how divs block elements are rendered when no width height attributes are set check this below it will answer your question

4903469
width	height
now the browser renders div#outer at top left corner of the browser s window with the width of 100px auto calculates the height based on the font used to display the string outer

4903469
width	height
if you have more content in your div#inner then the height width of your div#outer the inner one will overlap and go out the boundaries of div#outer

4903477
ireport	subreports
ireport designer allows you to create sophisticated layouts containing charts images subreports crosstabs and much more

4903541
post	get	webclient	httpwebrequest
due to the async nature of http access via webclient or httpwebrequest in silverlight 4 when i want to do multiple http get post serially i find myself writing code that looks like this

4903544
mousemove	mousedown
if this works out then you just need to find the appropriate event from the scroller or canvas that tells you when scrolling is occuring at worst you could capture mousedown mark a flag then capture mousemove and if the flag is set then run the code to invalidate re-validate

4903560
put	get	draggable	droppable
what i want to do is to put a draggable object and a droppable image in a panel and drag the draggable object on the image and get the position of where it was dropped

4903560
draggable	droppable
newly-updated js fiddle demo featuring revert invalid so dropping the draggable div anywhere but the droppable div will cause the draggable to animate back to its starting position

4903560
width	height
edited to add in the height width requirement and also to tidy up a few things and improve the css

4903561
google-chrome	firefox
it only works in google-chrome and firefox

4903561
opera	safari
i haven t tested in safari opera yet

4903564
sikuli	eggplant
we are currently in the process of porting a ui automation dsl domain specific language we built for eggplant to sikuli

4903571
post	get
ok after going over literally hundreds of these post i finally found a quick and easy way to get a valid page with a like button or any other facebook widget on it

4903583
width	height
the box model is such that the height and width pertain to the content area of the element

4903583
width	margin
this means the elements actual width is defined as width + padding + border + margin

4903583
google-chrome	firefox
it looks like just about everyone ie8 google-chrome firefox supports that which is good

4903591
children	parent
it is probably better to kill the parent before the children

4903591
children	parent
otherwise the parent may likely spawn new children again before he is killed himself

4903639
post	get
ok after going over literally hundreds of these post i finally found a quick and easy way to get a valid page with a like button or any other facebook widget on it

4903642
treemap	treeset
note a priorityqueue is not a list if you didn t care what type of collection it was the simplest would be to use a treeset which is just like a treemap but is a collection

4903642
arraylist	treeset
i suggest you write a list wrapper for a arraylist linkedlist priorityqueue treeset or one of the other sorted collections and implement the methods which will actually be used

4903645
put	get
i read that one of the methods to get around this was to put my listboxes into an updatepanel which i did and i am getting further

4903663
opera	firefox
i ve tested in firefox 3.6 chromium 8 opera 11 ubuntu 10.10

4903683
comparator	comparable
but sorting a list can have more complications from the side effects of duplicates and other constraints like making every object comparable or as i show in my code having to have a comparator that can do the work instead

4903693
range	minimum
second merge a1 and a2 starting the front of a1 write the minimum of the two elements being compared to the current index in a1 where the current index starts at 0 and range up to a1.length + a2.length - 1

4903707
for-loop	loops
just loops using a for-loop through them and check for the one whose editing property is set to yes

4903733
width	height
now consider what happens when you set the values width and height to 100 - should the padding and border just magically disappear from this picture

4903733
width	height
width and height is width and height border and padding is something else - to me it does t get anymore logical than that

4903733
width	height
width and height is width and a height but sometimes when you choose to set them to 100 they are also border and padding - now that would make no sense to me

4903783
post	get
i have been able to write code that performs get and post both of which do not have a request body

4903820
persistent	transient
is it just me or does it not sound like a transient object unsaved will be returned as persistent

4903846
google-chrome	firefox
however in firefox and google-chrome when in the admin the return link redirects to the custom 404 page i have for the web app

4903846
google-chrome	firefox
again this works without a problem in ie but in firefox and google-chrome on page load the session variable displays the 404 page link and after setting it displays the correct link

4903846
google-chrome	firefox
i added the faviocon file and the link in the head of the site.master file and google-chrome and firefox now work fine

4903846
google-chrome	firefox
anyone have an ideas why or how my session variable is getting overwritten by google-chrome or firefox

vb6	vba
however as one who migrated from vb6 vba to the endless and wonderful world of true inheritance available in .net i can say that discouraging the newcomer from seeing it as an end-all solution is not necessarily a bad thing

i think the problem is that cl.ly is send the content-type of the .webm file as binary octet-stream but firefox and opera requires it to be video webm

4909076
mp4	webm
i don t know if you can get cl.ly to change that but for now you could just remove the webm file and firefox 4 would play the mp4 via flash just like firefox 3 does

4909139
width	height
is there an equivalent to nsstring s sizewithfont method that can be used for calculating the height of text in a uitectview for a given width

4909158
post	get
if you need to do this via a post request versus get write the parameters in the body

4909177
post	get
perhaps with some additional browser info we can figure out what is causing the problem but for now it seems jquery does not want to guarantee functionality except on get and post

4909198
squash	merge
if that s all you want then maybe what you really want to do is squash all your merge commits down to only one of their parents so they look like a single commit instead of a merge

4909208

4909269
equals	tostring
the equals method should be overridden i kind of know how to write a tostring method

4909281
width	height
however it also resets the y coordinate so we go ahead and set the frame again to configure the x and y coordinatesâ in this example 10.0f for both x and y â leaving the width alone and keeping the height set to whatever -sizetofit calculated

4909288
versioning	upgrade
is it safe to upload an upgrade versioning of iphone s app to apple s app store assuming that as long as we don t touch core data user s data would not be influenced

4909290
pull	push
developers can still push pull from one another but shared gets a little more oversight

4909296

folder	directory
ok i found the problem now -- eclipse is putting the makefile into another directory than the src folder where all source code files are located

4909538
disk	ram
changes to data are occasionally flushed from ram to disk

4909563
cpu	processors
my question is is the reason this is so is because for the x86 processors the book refers to 32 bit the word size of the cpu is 32 bits and therefore it can pull the instructions with the nop in and process them in one go

4909576
google-chrome	firefox
when i open the urls in any browser - ie firefox google-chrome they all prompt me for credentials

4909588
oncreate	ondestroy
my understanding is that this data should persist for the full life cycle of the application from the initial oncreate to the final ondestroy

4909601
ratingbar	textview
the child view contains a textview and a ratingbar

4909629
oncreate	ondestroy

4910071
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
an update in a qgraphicsview is different from the one in a qgraphicsscene

4910071
qevent	qgraphicsview
if you want to know what part of the scene need to be repainted in addition to calling qgraphicsview setviewportupdatemode you need to install a event filter to the view and check for qevent paint

4910123
client-side	server-side
if we exclude ssl solution it s not available in my case then i was thinking of a javascript library which encrypts custom fields at client-side and a .net class decrypts them at server-side

4910170
profiling	instrumentation
our counting profiling require only enough space for track counts for each basic block stored in an array but some additional code space as instrumentation

4910205
int	chars
when you typecast from an int to a chars you are cutting down the number of bytes used from 4 to 1

4910215
int	chars
c will take the least-significant byte when doing a narrowing conversion so if you have the int value 0xcafebabe and you convert it to a chars you ll get the value 0xbe

4910215
int	chars
of course there s no actual guarantee that an int is four bytes or that a chars is one but i m pretty sure that the logic for doing the truncation will always be the same and will just drop the higher-order bits that don t fit into the chars

4910224
width	height
depending on the orientation of the image i set either the width or height to 75 and the other axis to auto

4910224

4910225
google-chrome	firefox
the code snippet below works on google-chrome and firefox 4.0 beta

4910230
int	boolean
if there isn t any type parameterization going on then the primitives are also good choices -- boolean or int for instance

4910335
ilist	icollection
on the other hand if your collection-type implemented the non-generic ilist or icollection types casting to those might come in handy

4910364
pull	push
if you don t have a central repo you will never use push pull or fetch

4910410
minimum	diagonal
i ve reduced the overlay code to the bare minimum of a single diagonal line in the code samples below

4910420
width	font-size	letter-spacing	font-size
the width depends on the font-size the font the letter-spacing it will be different depending on the browser etc.

4910440
dbml	edmx
my thoughts you re embedding sql in code in a string as opposed to using linq which is at least syntax-checked which helps provided you keep your dbml or edmx mapping file synched with your database structure

4910445
width	height
is it possible to get the x y coordinates and height width of all textfields in a pdf document using php or linux library

4910445
width	height
if not is it possible to traverse the pdf doc and calculate the x y and height width data for the text fields

4910448
superclass	subclassing
problem how can the in the superclass and also the or in the subclassing refer to the same collection of objects

i have a basic entitydatasource bound to a gridview

4910493
width	height

i have tried just using min or max but that did not work either

4910531
tcpdf	fpdf
tcpdf and fpdf can save it back

4910546
n-gram	words
you can even simulate this in mysql using fulltext indexing but you have to collect words from all your documents convert them to n-gram create fulltext indexes on them and hack them all together for fast lookup

4910549
implements	extends
i ve tried using the observable pattern extends the session bean from observable and including the method addobserver observer o in the business interface so it can be visible through the proxy to the swing views that implements the observer interface

4910553
inherited	subclassing
in my case i used my own subclassing inherited from uitableviewcell

4910658
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
it is the only object which will be dragged and dropped by player so all we need to do is add a uibutton object for the paddle and update its center in touchesbegan and touchesmoved

4910719
getter	setter
edit you may additionally be wondering why people would create a private member variable and then expose a public getter and setter to manipulate that variable

4910719
getter	setter
if instead there are public getter setter methods you can alter the private variable as needed and do whatever conversion or logic is necessary in the methods essentially keeping the change transparent

4910719
getter	setter
the habit of making variables private and wrapping them in public getter setter when necessary.

4910719
getter	setter
but on the comparatively rare occasions where it happens it ll be a lot easier with the getter setter in place

4910719
getter	setter
basically it s a design that adds essentially very little up-front code a one-time creation of a getter setter as opposed to on-going maintenance of member variable access to allow you the freedom to make changes to the class without breaking the binary compatibility of the object and breaking its contract.

4910719
getter	setter
it s definitely not a good habit to always write getter setter for all private members

4910719
getter	setter
the idea is to use getter setter for members which logically should be public

4910719
getter	setter
for example if the class defines a piece of text in a display and the members being modified by the getter setter are the font face size weight etc

4910745
folder	directory
how do i get the entire directory downloaded as a folder on my machine

4911035
width	height
the embed code have the attributes of width and height

it depends on whether you want your subclassing code to execute before or after the superclass code for that method

4914536
superclass	subclassing
i would say it s more common to do your own custom code after the call to super so that your subclassing code follows the superclass code

4914540
super	self
would you want the super to respond first or the self

4914545
client-side	server-side
less runs on both the client-side ie 6+ webkit firefox and server-side with node.js

4914623
int	double
in the function call because x has no visible prototype yet s will be promoted to int and f will be promoted to double

4914683
int	double
first of all without a prototype the arguments to a function always undergo default promotions before being passed as parameters so for example all the smaller int types get promoted to int and float gets promoted to double

4914708
opera	firefox
the problem is that i can t use any event on the iframe in firefox and opera ie untested for example i would like to track the onkeyup event

4914734
free	malloc
just an idea you could also implement a memory allocator and track all calls to malloc and free

4914748
cpu	processors
i can see in activity monitor that a ruby processors comes up and just spins chewing up cpu as it goes

4914763
google-chrome	firefox
the login works perfectly in firefox and in google-chrome

4914774
profiling	debugging
no debugging or profiling facilities

4914784
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby stand out as obvious candidates since they are .net languages

4914824
rss	feed
can anyone point me at a really simple way to pull rss or atom feed off of another site and bind its contents into a listview control on my page including the content of each item

4914837
post	get
it depends on what post or possibly get data your server is receiving from the form

4914856
width	height
you can create thumbnails for retrieved images just by creating an img element and settings its width and height to something smaller

4914856
width	height
there i ve assumed it s apprpropriate to force the image to be a certain width and height frequently with thumbnails it s useful if they re all the same size although the above will mess with aspect ratios

4914874
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient uses httpwebrequest under the covers

4914909
onresume	onpause
so calling glsurfaceview s onpause and onresume is definitely required

4914955
superclass	subclassing
why does initializing subclassing require calling the superclass #39

4914959
inherited	properties	getter	setter
however i think that the use of protected member variables should be made conciously because you not only plan to inherited but also because there is a solid reason derived classed shouldn t use the properties setter getter defined on the base class

4914959
getter	setter
when we define a getter setter on our base for a member variable we are essentially saying that this is how i want this variable to be referenced used

4914959
getter	setter
while there are design-driven exceptions in which one might need to alter the behavior created in the base class getter setter methods it seems to me that this would be a decision made after careful consideration of alternatives

4914959
getter	setter
for example when i find myself needing to access a member field from a derived class directly instead of through the getter setter i start thinking maybe that particular property should be defined as abstract or even moved to the derived class

4914959
getter	setter
of course in many cases it doesn t matter because we are not implementing anything within the getter setter beyond access to the variable

4914959
getter	setter
but again if this is the case the derived class can just as easily access through the getter setter

4914959
getter	setter
if the behgavior of the getter setter for a member field on the base class is changed in some way and a derived class references the protected field directly there is the potential for trouble

4914966
profiling	debugging
no debugging or profiling facilities

4914970
folder	directory
i put a folder called simple_cms in my httpdocs directory but my server won t start because my http.conf file is being written wrong how am i supposed to write it

4914994
post	get
the recommended solutions to mitigating json hijacking involve non-rest-full json post to get data

4914994
post	get
this blog describes a csrf issue regarding json hijacking and recommends using json post to get data

4914994
post	get
since using a http post to get data isn t very rest-full i d looking for a more restfull solution that enables rest actions per session or per page

4914994
post	get
i agree that it isn t restfull to get data using the recommended post workaround

4915003
rubygems	bundler
the cause of your problem is that under rails 3 rubygems are managed by a tool called bundler which manages all the dependencies between your gems and ensures that your application is always started with the right versions of the right gems even when you move it between servers

4915004
super	self
then you check if self is correct it may happen that super returned nil for any reason your w h parameters are incorrect

4915004
width	height
what you shouldn t do is to reassign height and width as this is already done by the shape initializer

4915022
post	get
despite the fact that the chat window makes ajax calls to the server every few seconds and always get at least one piece of data back also sends data to the server via ajax whenever the logged-in user post a message they are timed out after 20 minutes as if nothing was happening

4915047
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m attempting to write an applescript for apptivate to open the current firefox 4 or safari tab in google-chrome

4915047
firefox	safari
the safari section works and the if statement steps in to firefox but it doesn t copy the url

4915058
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have the problem in firefox 3.6.13 and have tested against current versions of safari win google-chrome opera and ie where the code all works perfectly

4915074
mkmapview	mkannotationview
your best bet might be to draw the circle yourself either using another uiview on top of the mkmapview or using a mkannotationview within the map view

4915079
fast-forward	merge
but even if b..a has something you might still be able to merge without conflicts so the above shows two things that there will be a fast-forward and thus you won t get a conflict

4915125
addition	multiplication
also note that you do not want you want if you insist on using parentheses though think it s pretty silly given that the relative precedence of multiplication and addition is quite well known

4915149
for-loop	loops
i know how to set up a for-loop in a function but i can t quite figure out how to break up a loops where it would stop and start

4915154
getter	setter
it d be nice if c# had a little syntax construct that implemented view model getter and setter automatically. but once you have that it s obvious how to modify it to inject logic

4915159
google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox google-chrome etc

4915159
post	get
normally i would just laugh and post the old get a new browser link but unfortunately i do not have the luxury on this one

4915176
jmenubar	jmenuitem
the jframe itself has jmenubar where in the menu structure there is a new game option among other not yet implemented jmenuitem that will create a new canvas object and replaces the old one and validates using the validate methods repaints the jscrollpane

4915185
queue	fifo
think of it like a fifo queue

4915194
awt	swing
your problem may be due to your mixing awt and swing heavy weight and light weight components in the same program and this is something that shouldn t be done unless you have definite need of this and know what you re doing

4915194
post	get
if you create and post this type of code you ll likely get a decent and complete solution quickly

4915200
cos	sin
basically i set the normal to 0 0 + - 1 when setting the top base and then side normals are cos toradian beta sin toradian beta 0

4915227
dlsym	dlopen
it dlopen s the library and gets all the function pointers via dlsym

4915310
versioning	upgrade
magento supports automatic module versioning upgrade including database scripts which you should use to make schema changes etc

4915326
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in both google-chrome firefox

4915343
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
try unbinding mouseenter mouseleave mouseover and mouseout

4915343
mouseleave	mouseenter
unbinding just mouseenter and mouseleave is sufficient

4915343
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
since not all browsers support these two events natively if i recall correctly only ie does mouseenter maps to mouseover and mouseleave maps to mouseout with some additional logic in each case to emulate the events

4915349
maven	pom.xml
however maven downloads these dependencies when i add the repository names to my pom.xml

4915377
free	malloc
if you have allocated an object using malloc then you need to free it at some point

4915391
width	height
your canvas is missing width and height properties

4915435
post	get
annotations are used to differentiate between get methods and post methods

4915435
post	get
note that this method is annotated as requestmethod.get which means it s invoked for get requests but not post requests

4915457
free	malloc
the rule is simple each individual malloc must correspond to a single individual free

4915471
inherited	properties
also if you don t have any log level specified for org.apache.http in your log4j properties file then it will inherited the log4j.rootlogger level

4915504
rss	feed
i need to create an rss feed for our information system which is written in php

4915504
rss	feed
i had no problems with the rss 2.0 specification nor with the creation of rss feed generator

4915525
apache	nginx
the apache version allows customizing the symlink resolving behavior for backward compatibility reasons while the nginx version only supports one type of behavior

4915538
folder	directory
the problem i m running into that i can t think of a good way to solve is when there are two folder in the same directory the path gets built wrong the second time

4915657
serializable	deserialization
once you have the connection and transmission of data between server and client going you then need to worry about serializable and deserialization of objects between client and server

4915661
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it shall display more or less properly on the major 4 ie firefox google-chrome safari

4915671
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
i know that in 1.5 havent really xmlhttprequest - just jqxhr highlevel abstraction and seems to be jqxhr not have upload attributes

4915695
terminate	timeout
you can see another person asking about stop in timeout in terminate or stop htmlunit

4915704
min	max
i ve played with all the options for ties.method option average max min random none of which are designed to provide the desired result

4915733
bluepill	runit
you can run chef-client as a daemon -d option as used in init scripts or under a service management tool like upstart runit daemontools or bluepill

4915733
daemons	launchd
you can certainly also launchd it from cron - just make sure to not run daemons mode there

4915784
postgresql	mysql
use what you can but if you need free and high quality databases use postgresql or mysql

4915787
strlen	substr
you don t need to use a strlen call since as noted in the substr docs

4915846
width	margin
just float your li elements left with a fixed width give your ul margin 0 auto to center and it should display fine

4915854
put	get
if yes is there any sample code so i can easily just put my data and get my chart

4915872
width	height
if you really do want to manipulate the width and height of the border in the template then use some binding to an intermediatory object i ll call it sizer held as a static resource -

4915872
width	height
now you simply have to create a sizer class that has the properties factor width height

4915872
width	height
when factor is changed you change the width and height properties and let the bindings handle update all the existing borders

4915885
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome in either mode you have to set the property on the body to make the page scroll while it is ignored if you set it on the html

4915885
google-chrome	safari
since the page is in standards mode they have to set it on both the html and body or it won t work in safari google-chrome

4915900
google-chrome	firefox
one of these libraries is jshashtable but when i try to create a new hashtable object in main.js google-chrome and firefox throw a referenceerror complaining that the variable does not exist

4915951
postgresql	mysql
i m attempting a transition from mysql to what seems to be the stricter and less rails-friendly postgresql

4915952
folder	directory
you could just place the zip file in the magento root directory and run unzip from the command line that doesn t do the silly obliterate the current folder contents that the gui does

4916041
postgresql	mysql
postgresql will probably be harder to install than mysql on xampp but i believe that you can get a lot out of doing so

4916041
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is also a lot better imo than mysql and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

4916071
vmware	virtualbox
is there some way to check this irregardless of the type of vm vmware xen virtualbox

4916074
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
you have to subclass it the uiimageview and override one of touchesbegan touchesmoved or touchesended methods according to what you want to do

4916104
realloc	malloc
you might want to consider using malloc and realloc

4916113
children	parent
updating the children when clicking something works but updating the parent when clicking a box

4916174
memcached	apc
you could cache query results in memcached and or use apc cache to speed up your php code and decrease disk i o

4916205
primefaces	icefaces
i believe that primefaces can t be combined with icefaces or any other implementation

4916217
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
i prefer using powermockito with mockito but if this is not possible i have no problem with using easymock instead

4916226
bibtex	latex
use bibtex along with a .bst file which spits out html rather than latex

4916281
tinyint	boolean
it doesn t make sense to index tinyint columns if they are used as boolean because this index won t be selective enough

4916287
union-find	tree
so far i ve only been able to implement the minheap and sets for union-find i am still unsure of the purpose of union-find and a sorting algorithm for the purpose of creating a spanning tree

4916320
public	protected
the hide annotation is used for things that for internal purposes needed to be public or protected but are not considered something sdk developers should be using

4916331
rss	feed
i am currently trying to display a rss feed in a php page but it seems to have a problem between the xslt_create function and php5

4916351

2 more and i can delete the post and get a badge.

4916375
namedtuple	dictionary
converts records to object instances or dictionary or namedtuple if you prefer

4916396
for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop to iterate through the arrays indexes

4916400
union	distinct
in particular its two operations - union and find - correspond to the act of connecting together two distinct groups of nodes that were previously not connected as would be the case if you added an edge that connected two trees contained in different parts of the spanning forest

4916412
post	get
what jfoucher s code does is get the post values and if they aren t both set then it will create another rule

4916421

width	margin
a good and rock solid solution for centering elements is to set a width 500px and then adding margin 0 auto

4916569

i am just getting my feet wet with qt i am trying to pull the string from a qlineedit and append it to a qtextbrowser after clicking a button for simplicity error checking i am just having it append the word appended at the moment

4916789
google-chrome	firefox
you might want to do an alert pic1 to see just what is in there or if you are using firefox or google-chrome you can use the javascript debugger tools

multiplying	add
since i m essentially doing the same thing twice i made a method to multiplying a base number incrementally and add the sum of all the answers togethor

4916856
for-loop	loops
using for-loop is much simpler if you use condition as limit for breaking loops

4916856
division	modulo
most programming languages have have operator modulo division

4916859
int	double
could we do better for instance by keeping a sorted list of last 20 conversions from double price to int price

4916899
photoshop	paint.net
also paint.net or photoshop can t open .ico files

4916926
for-loop	loops
second isum is declared within your for-loop which means it will keep being re-initialized to 0 every time loops executes

4916937
for-loop	loops
before matlab version 2008a or a version near that release for loops took a major hit in any matlab code because the interpreter a layer between the very readable script and a lower level implementation of the code would have to re-interpret the code each time through the for-loop

4916949
hide	show
hi i just want to be able to toggle to hide show a div respectively with a class

4916956
post	get
in this post i showed one way to create them at the same time that your database is get created by code first via sqlcommand method in a custom initializer class but it s not really different from manually creating it yourself

4916982
mouseup	mousedown
the mousedown event would define one corner and the mouseup the second

4916983
width	height
no matter what i set in this line i ve tried explicitly setting the zoom setting the width height in pixels etc. the device completely ignores it and renders the website very small and anchored to the upper left-hand corner of the screen

i have a problem with jquery fadein or fadeout method

4916992
fadein	fadeout
the fadein or fadeout method causes a scroll to the article position

4917047
richtextbox	textblock
when the user opens up the entity it should usually be textblock labels or readonly textboxes etc. and if he clicks edit if he has permission to it should go edit mode and all the fields labels should be inverted to textboxes richtextbox etc. comboboxes or any other editable fields that are not just labels

4917123
accessor	properties
in this case the assignment to the .hey properties a retain is implict in the accessor method

4917124
folder	dir
rails will auto load stuff in models dir however for the lib folder you gotta tell to do so by checking config application.rb and adding this

4917128
keydown	keyup
i should probably mention that this is not the best workaround because if you have some other keydown or keyup listener it will remove them as well although ive showed you where the problem is it s not that hard to make this fix more solid from here

4917162
google-chrome	firefox
the good news first you won t need much more than javascript if you just want to access bookmarks and send them to a server neither on firefox nor on google-chrome

4917180
automake	autotools
if you use automake you re pretty much using the entire autotools

4917211

i can t help you more then this since i have no idea what your entity-relationship diagram or at least table definitions look like

4917235
width	height
my captured image takes up the height but not the width in other words i don t seem to be able to stretch the image according to the size of the picture box

4917244
width	height
it has a fixed height and width

4917255

note i attempt using swfobject.embedswf path divid width height to load other videos which doesn t work

4917256
pop-up	dialog
i wonder if i might disable the keychain dialog that pop-up whenever my application wants to access the keychaindata

4917259
folder	directory
with the help of some basic command line applications it creates subfolders in your documents folder mkdir -p it will not overwrite existing directory

4917260
folder	directory
jsp runs but i can t see under tomcat directory any mytutorial folder so where did it publish my jsp

4917278
width	height
set it s height the same as resulting div but keep width auto

4917287
int	chars
indexes work better with int than chars varchar go with a dedicated int primary key column

4917300
division	modulo
note that gcc at least is able to compile this to x86 code which does not use any division operations since the modulo is a constant

4917345
post	get
i need to be able to access post and get data

4917361
agile	sprint
what i ve been told from people who ve been using scrum for a while ie this is opinion is that doing uml diagrams can be a bit time consuming because as your development methodology is agile your requirements could very easily radically change after the first sprint s show-and-tell which means you could be doing fairly big redesigns

4917362
struts	xwork
i don t know of an easy plug-and-play solution for this so you will probably have to implement it yourself -- plan on spending quite a bit of time just coming to grips with how the localization features of struts 2 and xwork are implemented

4917388
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
runtimeexception unchecked-exception

4917388
illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
in this case the unchecked-exception you are looking for would be illegalargumentexception

4917392
mouseup	mousedown
the custom control has a mousedown and mouseup event which passes a message up from the control to the parent.parent custom control - day panel - calendar form and calls public methods startdragging and stopdragging respectively

4917392
mouseup	mousedown
i can see it being added and removed on mousedown and mouseup but it is being added at 0 0 under the panels and day labels

4917392
mouseup	mouseenter
if i remove the mouseup code the control does drag with the mouse however as soon as the mouseenter the panels which the control is sadly underneath the drag action stops

4917394
post	put
the post is generated as a static html and put somewhere in public_html

4917404
erlang	ocaml
examples of large projects developed with functional languages include xen ocaml ericsson s infrastructure erlang and twitter scala - though i m cheating a little bit here since scala also fully integrates the object-oriented paradigm

4917459
put	get
since no sane jquery plugin makes any assumptions about the server-side technologies you will just have to get the jquery plugin to overwrite the div in which you put the output of your php twitter feed library

4917467
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
to be clear i am not using ubuntu but linux mint 9 which is based on ubuntu 10.04

4917474
width	height
i ve tried all sorts of combinations of translate and even skipping scale altogether and using a width and height in shape

4917537
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
control which handled mousedown event captures mouse input and receives all following mousemove events until it releases mouse input on mouseup event that s why calendar_mousemove is not called

4917537
mousemove	mousedown
handle mousemove event for the same control which generated mousedown event

4917566

use different layout files for portrait and landscape positions

4920956
post	get
if it can be done could you post a link to resources that would help me get started

4920978
getter	setter
only provide getter setter if it is actually needed don t just do it automatically

i know that you can start reading the rss feed of a facebook page itself now perhaps just a little parsing is all you need

4921032
getter	setter
another reason you sometimes want to use getter and setter is the use of libraries

4921064
getter	setter
sometimes for example you may want the getter to return a clone of the object or the setter to just copy values on the private object rather than pointing the handler to the new object passed to the setter

4921170

4921694

the self.location means you are accessing a properties via a generated properties accessor

4922041

if you have a custom layer on top of udp then the performance of this will also need to be taken into account when comparing against tcp - so i don t think anyone on so will be able to give you a definitive answer

4922056

mason chang that makes sense but if the emits of signals that happen when using qgraphicsobject is what makes qgraphicsobjects slower than qgraphicsitems then you can avoid this by inheriting from qobject and qgraphicsitem instead of using qgraphicsobject

4922184
inherited	properties
basically this is a kind of special case where some properties inherited data context of the owner object

4922184
inherited	properties
thus for example the inherited context always works on properties of type freezable another interesting article about freezables

4922623
implements	extends
i followed the method of extends the user class for implements custom users in my application

4922640
inherited	properties
as you said that other ui controllers work with 0.5 alpha there should be no difference with uislider since they inherited alpha properties from uiview class and there is reference to the opaque properties you should always set the value of this properties to no if the view is fully or partially transparent

qgraphicsitem	qobject
there are two options that i know of use qgraphicsobject or inherit from qobject and qgraphicsitem

4922801
qgraphicsitem	qobject
inheriting from qobject and qgraphicsitem

4922801
qgraphicsitem	qobject
when constructing a class that inherits from qobject and qgraphicsitem it seems that you get the most interesting feature of qgraphicsobject minus the performance hit you are able to define slots and emit signals in your class but you don t inherit the default implementation of qgraphicsobject that would constantly emit signals on changes you might not be interested in

4922828
daemon	cron

4923362
hash	md5
since the download must be validated against an md5 hash there seems to be no way for me to use the network inputstream after a resume to get the correct hash since java.security.messagedigest doesn t seem to have method that basically says start upating the current md5 hash from this partial md5 hash that i have from the previous download

4923362

1- when your calling super init your making your super class run its init function first so it can initialize your object that your inheriting normally that would be nsobject or any superclass that you decided to extends

4924657
super	self
the super init functions will return self at the end of that process just like your doing in your init function

4924657
super	self
2- when you do the assignment self super init your actually assigning that return value from your super into your own

4924657
super	self
3- the if around that assignments actually evaluates the success failure of the super init call cause if it failed you would have got a nil back and the assignments would have been nil to self

getter	setter
i needed to check the assigned therefore i simply need a getter setter like this

4925317
getter	setter
and not necessarily a getter setter magic method overloading like this

4925317
getter	setter
that said i simply need a getter setter

4925317
getter	setter
is there any way to get and set a private property in php as in c# without using getter setter magic method overloading

4925317
getter	setter
there are rumors floating around the web that magic method is 10x slower then explicit getter setter method i haven t tested it yet but it s a good thing to keep in mind

4925317
getter	setter
i have to stuff everything in one huge method if i use magic method rather then split them into different function for each property as in explicit getter setter

4925317
getter	setter
i m curious about performance overhead between using magic method and explicit getter setter therefore i created my own benchmark for both method and hopefully it can be useful to anyone read this

4925317
getter	setter
with explicit getter setter

4925317
getter	setter
that said both setter and getter with magic method and method exists justs costs 2x than the explicit getter setter

4925820
realloc	malloc
that means realloc ptr newsize can fail anytime malloc newsize would have failed

4925820

4926459
getter	setter
the persondto just has a subset of the getter and setter of the server-side domain person object

4926459

4927320
serializable	deserialization
you ll have to add the serializable and or deserialization providers if you re using custom types but you can do the delegation of the majority of the work to the standard providers. i d still like to caution that you should still ensure that the resource indicated by the path should be the same in both cases

4927322
implements	extends
if list implements extends serializable then you have implied the contract that all implementation classes subclasses of list are also serializable which is not always true

4927350

you can get a touchescancelled call after a touchesbegan and without a matching touchesended event

4927654
jar	war
and when i warble in the top level directory it doesn t generates a jar file as expected but instead a generates a war file

4927662
touchesbegan	touchesended
rather than looking at the number of touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent calls you should look at the nsset of uitouch objects passed to those methods

4927667
put	get
another option is taffy add one cfc per uri template and define a method for each http method you want to support get put delete etc

4927696
queue	fifo
i have 6 threads in total and two fifo queue

4927709

then i retrieve the progress of the file by updating it in the file upload post method and grabbing it with a get request to a different class

4927729
folder	directory
however i was just recently given a couple folder with a fairly large html site to be placed within this directory including html txt picture files

4927748
int	double
just want to double check that the default implicitly defined by compiler copy constructor for c++ classes performs the copy constructor on each member variable as well using the old value to get the copied value for each member and for atomic objects just uses a bit copy int and floats

4927749
gmail	hotmail
the problem exists in gmail and hotmail

4927763
hash	md5
md5 is a 128 bit cryptographic hash function so different messages should be distributed pretty well over the 128-bit space

4927793
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectinputstream and objectoutputstream do not care at all about your types when invoking they simply look at the object at hand and its class

4927805
vb6	vba
something to keep in mind is that vb6 hit end of life in 2008 and vba is still included for office 2010 but it is being encouraged that developers use vsta instead

4927808
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
are there any good example of a uitabbarcontroller inside of a uinavigationcontroller

4927809
firefox	safari
it seems that firefox and safari have different format support on their video tag .ogg for firefox mp4 based for safari

4927809
firefox	safari
meanwhile firefox supports the .ogg format without further plugins apple safari needs the quicktime plug-in for playing mp4 video in the tag video

4927846
post	get
and that you are post ing the form and not using get

4927956
cout	cin
cout and the operator work fine in compiling c++ program in cygwin but as soon as i try the cin operator compiler breaks says cygwin doesnt recognize

4928107
folder	directory
i have created a folder in dotnetnuke programmatically on the root portal directory

button	checkbox
there s a form with three checkbox and a button

4928135
int	chars
a chars chars maybe of size one byte but when it comes to four bytes value e.g int how does the cpu differ it from an int instead of four chars per byte

4928143
public	protected
your login page has to be public so that people can access it but you css script is probably in a protected folder or has permissions set to hide it

4928160
int	chars
the c++ compiler knows to emit 8-bit instructions for chars and 32-bit instructions for int

4928185
folder	directory
you need to adjust the paths in that file to point to the cake core files folder based on your hosting providers directory path

4928233
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome do not

4928233
google-chrome	safari
why are safari and google-chrome ignoring these changed values

4928265
addition	multiplication
corresponding to those registers there are operations like addition multiplication etc. which act on register values of certain size too

4928269
put	get
i just needed to put url and name to get those variables from my selected object

4928309
jstl	taglib
further your pom also specifies apache s jstl 1.1 implementation via taglib standard

4928309
jstl	taglib
jstl core taglib documentation for the right taglib uris

4928324
ienumerable	ienumerator
but it could be that in some situations it returns the same ienumerator instance that s already been partially or fully enumerated so it all really just depends on the specific intended usage of that particular ienumerable

4928337
ienumerable	ienumerator
most implementations of ienumerable return a fresh ienumerator which starts at the beginning of the list

4928345
put	get
when i put this in js i get the error invalid group

4928426
persistent	transient
when i persistent my contact though i get an exception not-null property references a null or transient domain.contact.company

i need to encode an int i into buffer chars s of size n

4928480
put	get
on my dev box running visual studio 2010 it works like a charm but when i put it on the production box all i get is the generic http 500 error saying the page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred.

4928486
division	subtract
it seems that simply adding up to the numerator while giving both the division and the mod is way too impractical so i came up with another way to divide using bit shifting subtract and 2 look up tables

4928486
octal	binary
example multiples of 5 in binary - block size 3 octal

4928490
apache	nginx
however i see that it says in production.rb that apache or nginx should already be serving static assets

4928497
width	height
you can use css to handle the height width and handle any overflow

4928505
google-chrome	firefox
looks the same in firefox and fixes it in google-chrome

4928509
int	chars
for example if the radix is 2 binary you need to supply a buffer with a minimal length of 8 sizeof int + 1 chars one chars for each bit plus one for the string terminator

4928513
cpu	processors
in many processors architectures the cpu fetches 32 bits from memory and internally ignores the unused bits keeping the lowest 8 bits

4928513
int	chars
knowing that a processor s int can hold 4 bytes and that it fetches 4 bytes at a time many programmers like to pack 4 chars into an int to improve performance

4928513
int	chars
this performance improvement may be wasted by the execution time required to pack and unpack the chars from the int

4928513
int	chars
in summary i highly suggest you forget about how many bytes make up an int and any relationship to a quantity of chars or bytes

4928518
vim	emacs
however learning an editor like vim or emacs has other benefits like being able to be completely cross-platform

4928518
vim	emacs
while using an ide might assist in you learning a language because you get syntax completion documentation etc learning an editor can lead to the kind of power usage that one using an ide can only dream of but it will take a while to get to that point on something like vim or emacs

4928523
rss	feed
for example i am testing the jquery above to get a rss feed

4928523

is it possible to indent a block of code in mediawiki using syntaxhighlight geshi

4928612
geshi	mediawiki
i have tried wrapping the geshi code container with colons using mediawiki s standard indentation syntax but that prevents syntaxhighlight geshi from parsing the code correctly

4928616
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
update also make sure the success function is even being called--use a tool like firebug firefox or developer tools in google-chrome or safari to inspect net traffic to see what the result of your call is

4928620
longlistselector	listpicker
the page that contains the listpicker control also contains a longlistselector

4928638
maven	pom.xml
the sonar installation documentation mentions that the dependencies must be added to the aux classpath via the maven pom.xml file for this to be rectified

4928660
width	height	bmp	png
how can i retrieve metadata information such as format jpeg bmp png .. width height etc

4928667
stdout	fflush
that works as is with ruby 1.9.2 which doesn t need stdout to fflush between each write

4928680
folder	dir
i m guessing this means something in my usr local area relating to my ruby and rails initial installs is mainatining this info my apps are setup in my documents folder in my home dir

4928696
google-chrome	safari
at the very least you should report this as a bug to webkit google-chrome and safari here

4928735
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in safari and google-chrome but in firefox the info that fades in anchor tag with class of .tooltip shows up in the wrong place

4928738
folder	directory
title pretty much says it i m looking to add a line to a script i m working on that would copy a random file from a directory say desktop old and paste it into another folder say desktop new

4928774
rational-numbers	integer
if you know what a rational-numbers is namely one integer divided by another then it s not difficult to figure out that notation

4928774
rational-numbers	fractions
i have never seen it before but from the properties of rational-numbers fractions it s clear that the square brackets indexing is for a representation as a vector of two integers

4928885
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
problem verified in google-chrome firefox and opera

4928917
int	double
the basic types int double etc don t implement a method you can use to compute your math

4929000

they give min value max value and number of bins

4929004
rss	feed
i ve got a php-managed site that is pulling content from a posterous blog via an rss feed

4929019
range	min	range	max	min	max
once we have our anonymous one dimensional function my_func if you don t want to use an optimization method to solve the equation but happen to know a range range_ min range_ max in which my_func 0 then the following algorithm will find the zero of the function for you provided you re working with a continuous function

4929033
min	max
if you know the min and max then any particular value x should be considered to fall into the array at index

4929048
google-chrome	safari
the app behaved correctly in google-chrome and safari both for windows

4929054
hide	show
i need to display a table of 40-50 columns and 100.000 rows and hopefully let the user filter the data based on certain data items i.e only show rows that have a certain value in a certain column show only data that was recorded on monday and hide all other weekdays

4929061
range	min	range	max	min	max
so when the user gives you the min max and number of bins you can compute the size and therefore the range of each bin

4929092
width	height
to answer the question of how to place the header image the best way would be to define a div with a specified height a 550px tall header seems awfully large to me but hey its your site and width probably set to 100 and use the background-image css property to place the image there

4929102
csv	tsv
if that sentence didnt make a whole bunch of sense i would recommend skimming over the django tutorial ...actually you probably should do that anyway python has methods to turn datatypes such as dictionaries csv s in your case i guess a tsv lol to this format

4929122
width	height
the background of this div is a css gradient and has a height of 100 if the gradient is applied to to the actual body of the page it doesn t actually extend the whole width of the page

4929122
google-chrome	firefox
the layout works as i want in firefox and google-chrome but the content of the page scrolls over the fixed upper area in ie7

ostream	istream
consequently it s possible to without actually getting a full class definition for either istream or ostream

4930231
ostream	istream
iostream explicitly includes istream and ostream c++0x requires this and the gnu libstdc++ version does this so ostream is technically unnecessary

4930231
cout	cin
iostream declares the standard i o facilities cin cout ...

4930236

i would suggest implementing some filenameaware interface for this as i o streams are usually referenced with the inputstream outputstream abstract classes to avoid coupling your application with specific implementations

4930924
prng	random
well rand certainly gives you pseudo-random numbers although the prng implementation might not return random values evenly distributed along the bits of the returned value in many implementations the higher bits are changing more often than the lower bits which is why your code is a poor choice for selecting a random value between 0 and 255

4930940
put	get
so it turns out that whenever i put any code in the vertex shader or frag shader other than gl_color ... the solid color i get disappears.

4931172
nexus	artifactory
taking that your example dresden ocl has over 20 jar files and you need to distribute it to many developers the best solution would be to install a repository manager somewhere like nexus or artifactory take your time to upload these 20 jars to that repository and use them

4931625

4932398

4932838
aggregate-functions	sum
having got this dataset you can then use the aggregate-functions sum over the event.duration field to work out the total number of hours

4932838
aggregate-functions	sum
if you just sum it straight off you ll get the total length of all the events in the whole database but if you use group by on the staff id it ll sum up each staffer s hours separately - group by is pretty much essential when working with aggregate-functions

4932838
aggregate-functions	sum
this time we can use the aggregate-functions count and sum without grouping because we do actually want to work over the whole dataset

4932874
int	chars	min	max
assume table a a chars b int c int d and the a column can include same object name so i want to update the table with the condition if column s a value and b value are found in two rows row1 a1 2 numbery and row2 a1 2 numberx then if numberx numbery 0- avg third column elsif numberx numbery 0 then min else max i.e -3 10- 10

4936587
post	get
when trying to add a new record in master table and then trying to add records in details table before posting the record in master table i get this error non-nullable column cannot be updated to null and this happens because the master table primary key value is still not known because i didn t post the master record but if i tried the same scenario except that before i add the details records i posted the master record then the error doesn t appear

4936749
ssl	https
solution for the problem is to use only http instead of https because the ssl certificate of meebo is not valid

4937075
portrait	landscape
i have an ui where i need a fragment to be displayed with a view in landscape mode but not in portrait mode

4937075
portrait	landscape
i figured i could handle this by using the tag for the landscape layout while creating the fragment programmatically if it wasn t started in the case when we are in portrait

4937075
portrait	landscape
this works fine as long as you start out in landscape if you start in portrait where the fragment is created programmatically your application will crash when you rotate the emulator when it tries to attach the fragment to your layout

i don t have a bunch of office versioning to compare but if they ve taken their own advice and kept the upgrade code constant across versioning then you can call msienumrelatedproducts to get the product code for the versioning of office that s installed on your machine

edit the horizontal centering can be accomplished either by setting the parent div s width to 100 with a text-align center defined or via auto margins

4937549
equals	gethashcode
my problem was that the objects that i was adding to the datagrid and listbox had overridden equals and gethashcode functions

4937555
mp4	h.264
the url you point the player to must be a supported file format h.264 encoded mp4

4937623
equals	gethashcode
for things like equality however you may need to use more than one operation so an interface becomes useful - has both equals and gethashcode methods for example

4937695

if i put an overflow auto in the div that contains the reportviewer control then i get a horizontal scrollbar at the bottom but then in order to click the view report button i have to scroll way over thus moving the entire report

4937802
int	chars
the chars colors should be declared as int

4937880

i have access to both linux ubuntu

4937929
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
this is a bit of a shot in the dark but i m guessing that selectable uses any or all of the mouseover mouseout mouseenter and mouseleave events to trigger a selection

4937929
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could try the mouseenter and mouseleave events in there too

4938030
overlay	z-order
i need a way to either flatten the existing image overlay onto the pdf content or set the z-order such that my newly added overlay can sit on top

4938034

4938260
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox but i can t find a solution for google-chrome safari

4938261
post	get
i should be able to get the template resource it shouldn t be hidden behind post

4938264
post	get
to tumblr and then somehow get the url to that and use that in your tag for your post

4938266

note that the member needs to be public as defined here but we could easily add a friend declaration for the tag support protected and private properties

4938273
tinyint	varchar
the problem is when inserting one of those a number 3 digits in a tinyint also tried text varchar and other fieldtype the result is only the first digit is added

4938276
post	get
i always thought that using get is not a good idea and that it s better to use post

4938276
post	get
the only problem i m seeing with post and which i m guessing is why a site like twitter went with get is that the request can t be made directly from the browser

4938276
post	get
a reading the metadata of the file and returning it should that be get or post or

4938276
post	get
b i m reading the metadata and modifying the metada on the file and returning the modified file should that be get or post

4938276
post	get
the question is are a and b considered get or post operations

4938290
getter	setter
when using jsdt to edit a javascript source file using this syntax for getter and setter like so

4938311
sorting	grouping
but since you tagged this question with mysql i ll mention a mysql-specific tip when your query implicitly generates a temporary table for instance while sorting or grouping by varchar fields are converted to char to gain the advantage of working with fixed-width rows

4938331
serializable	deserialization	getter	setter
it generates a storage class with getter setter serializable and deserialization routines for every message in the protocol description

4938346
width	height
is it possible to fix the width and height of an html5 canvas element

4938358
post	get
the only meaningful difference on the server side is that get requests are usually logged completely with parameters while the data of post requests are usually not logged but this is not a rule for custom servers which can log or not log anything

4938358
post	get
moreover in many cases you can use get or post and the server will handle both cases correctly and transparently

4938358
post	get
i can also think of get requests to be easier to handle and less resource- consuming but this depends on how the code is written cause in get request everything is passed in header and crlfcrlf is a request separator with post it s necessary to perform additional parsing of the body

4938396
lan	localhost
i working on a php socket daemon which works via localhost but when i try to connect from outside the lan or another pc it doesn t work

4938414
post	get
i always thought that using get is not a good idea and that it s better to use post

4938414
post	get
use get for reading information post for writing information

4938414
post	get
get requests shouldn t modify server-side state while post requests can safely do so

4938414
post	get
in general use get for reads and post for writes

4938414
post	get
get requests are no less insecure than post requests

4938414
post	get
the only problem i m seeing with post and which i m guessing is why a site like twitter went with get is that the request can t be made directly from the browser

4938414
post	get
your browser can generate post requests just as easily as get requests it s simply harder to submit post requests via the address bar

4938421
post	put
the workaround is to use other verbs like post or put for transmitting large amounts of data

4938456
listener	eventhandler
if a class wants to register itself as a listener to a game object it must inherit the game eventhandler class

4938456

4938516
post	get
as anon said get for retrieving data post for making changes sending data which keeps you in line with the http standard

4938516
post	get
afaik you can t mix get post params

4938516
post	get
and yes get string do have a max length but so does post albeit much larger and dependent on your server settings

4938539
post	get
when you post to the create action is the model valid or invalid when you get the exception

4938565
google-chrome	firefox
what you re seeing is the difference in how firefox and google-chrome treat border-collapse

4938565
google-chrome	firefox
in essence when it sees border-collapse firefox revises the properties of each cell in order to remove borders - whereas google-chrome keeps the values and just overlaps each border

4938571
width	height
for one thing it sticks padding and line-height in the middle of width and height or left and top

4938584
opera	google-chrome
i m not sure what repercussions if any it will have but simply setting display block on tbody fixes it in google-chrome and opera where it also didn t work

4938906
pbkdf2	hash
for use as underlying hash function in pbkdf2 however it s basically used as a prng

4938906
pbkdf2	hash
as such it should be still secure to use sha1 as hash for pbkdf2 right

4938940
vim	emacs
vim emacs

4938966
vim	textmate
after years of textmate â expansion was a habit i couldn t didn t want to drop so i ditched supertab quickly and learned to love vim s native omni completion

youâ ll be able to switching between 1-6 7-12 13-18 etc by swiping your finger across the screens similar to that of the home screens within ios to view these batch of images icons

4939016
x86	64bit
in this case you chose x86 32 bit which means you also need to install 32-bit odac and make sure that you aren t referencing the 64bit oracle dlls by mistake

4939026
put	get
it ll get the headers we set in the last step and download it instead of displaying it and the user will stay put on the page like we want

4939066
width	height
note further that the height and width are the logical canvas dimensions used for drawing and are different from the style.height and style.width css attributes

4939068
clang	icc
you could also try to drag some common expressions out of the inner loop but decent compilers e.g gcc icc or clang should do this quite well all by themselves

4939085
folder	directory
copy problematic folder into some backup directory and remove it from your svn working directory

4939085
folder	directory
remember to delete all .svn hidden directory from the copied folder

now move your folder back to working directory add it and commit

4939091
outputstream	inputstream
i also have a simple pass through method that simply writes the server s inputstream to the client s outputstream uses readline also and works fine - ie any other url shows up in the browser no problems so readline is ok

i m not sure exactly why but we use the mvn cargo start plugin instead for testing locally when building with maven

4939197
google-chrome	firefox
i can get firefox to work just fine with these proxies in windows as well as google-chrome under ubuntu

4939198
width	height
there is no font you can rely on being available on all platforms and height width ratios for different strings will differ for different fonts fixed-width being slightly better

4939200
min	max
of course if you want to return max min value when the double is too large you could do this

4939273
gridview	rowdatabound
i am making conditional formatting changes to the data in my gridview using a rowdatabound event

4939279
udp	tcp
telnet uses tcp which uses stream connection oriented sockets not the datagram sockets used by udp

lock the activity to landscape mode but draw assets as if they are in portrait

4939341
google-chrome	firefox
it does not work in firefox or google-chrome

4939361

i know i am a little late to this post but you can try and leverage a cookie to get this done

4939397
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
however in ie 8 microsoft introduced another object similar to the xmlhttprequest - xdomainrequest but i don t think you are using that else ie 7 would fail

4939423
ubuntu	debian
task migrate a repository running on debian to a new location ubuntu with svnadmin dump load and svndumpfilter

4939438
post	put
the method signatures for post and put are identical which of course c# doesn t like

4939520
stdout	fflush
edit and as aaz has mentioned you should fflush stdout since it is line buffered by default

4939526
bash	tcsh
sh the original bourne shell ksh - the korn shell csh - the c shell bash tcsh etc

4939590

google-chrome	firefox
export all the tests to mstest so that each test can be run in ie google-chrome and firefox

4939636
valgrind	callgrind
now i am interested in reading 1 way or another because callgrind part of valgrind show them demangled while in assembly they are shown mangled so i would like to either mangle the valgrind function output or demangle the assembly names of functions

4939675
puts	gets
i have a process that gets a files from a directory and puts them in a list

4939711
division	multiplication
so it appears to be an issue with how the class handles multiplication division and parenthesis

4939737
super	self
super countryadminform self .__init__ args kwargs

4939749
min	max	min	median	median	max
if you use the apache benchmarking tool ab you can get a set of statistics based on multiple accesses and multiple concurrent accesses giving you min mean median and max access times and stddev broken down by connect processing and waiting

4939941
ilist	iqueryable
i m enumerating the iqueryable into an ilist

4939947
rss	feed
i doubt altering meta information like rss feed favicons etc will take effect post load

google-chrome	firefox
80 calls of the interval takes around 1600ms in firefox but it takes around 1670ms in google-chrome

4940035
google-chrome	firefox
the code inside the interval takes between 0-1 seconds in google-chrome and 0-2 seconds in firefox so queueing shouldn t be a problem

4940038
google-chrome	firefox
selenium will take control of your browser firefox google-chrome ie and will allow you to get pieces of data using css xpath selectors

4940067
width	height
put an nslog at the end that prints out the x y width height and see what s there

4940160
tcplistener	tcpclient
or you could set up sockets named pipes tcplistener tcpclient or even a udpclient

4940163
width	height
it filled it s width and height using the width height of the text inside as dictated by wrap_content

4940183
x86	64bit
x86 cpu operations take place in 8 16 32 or 64bit

4940234

i can handle mouse events fine but my keydown and keyup methods are never called

4940249

the key is to define an interface iself of out t whose one member self is a properties by which the object returns itself as a t and then for each interface ifoo declare a corresponding generic of the form ifoo of out t which inherited from both ifoo and iself of t

4940258
updatepanel	onclientclick
combining the use of onclientclick with javascript s confirm as suggested by pilgerstorfer franz with an updatepanel for the ajax request you mentioned.

4940314
x86	64bit
there are no x86 instructions that can move 24 bits in one operation but there are single instruction moves for 8 16 32 and 64bit data

4940333
int	chars
since you requested an int value from the stream it only reads the numerical chars from the stream it reads 1 and 0 but it stops at n

4940341
portrait	landscape
return yes for portrait yes allow the view to rotate from landscape to portrait

4940386

i m working in an environment where some developers are working on an x86 environment still winxp and others are working on a 64bit enviroment windows server 2008 r2

4940402
x86	64bit
on 32 bit env this is fine but when moving to 64bit these references fail as they should be pointing to c program files x86 - every time the solution is checked in and reopened in another environment the references need to be updated

4940416
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works greate on firefox google-chrome opera and safari but in ie this code doesn t work

this way once the form is submitted through your js code the return false will prevent your submit button from submission the same request again

4940481
put	get
here s what i have but it is posting as a get versus a put

4940493
hash	md5
you could create an md5 hash that resembles the original url and save both in the database

4940494
put	get
prohibiting the read-only fields in the put is a bad idea because it will require the clients to strip away fields they received from you in the get

4940494
put	get
taking data received from your get modifying one field of interest and sending it back to you with a put should be a brain-dead simple round-trip for the client

4940495
slideup	slidedown
use slidedown docs and slideup docs instead so the direction is explicitly tied to the event type

4940509
post	get
in my post action handler i find myself having to copy the code from my get action handler in order to re-render the view again

4940509
post	get
i have tried allowing my action handler to handle both post and get but then i have the input params to deal with

4940509
post	get
my post action handler will have the view model as an input parameter but for the get action handler will not

put the content within the iframe into a div then get the height of the div

4940611
rss	feed
i m new to web development and have started using jsonp and google s feed api to get the rss articles using client side javascript

4940611
gif	png
i hope its not as bad as having to download the web page s html and looking for gif and png links

4940629
rss	feed
if i m not mistaken the images might be returned in the rss feed itself and you just have to run through the feed looking for images to paste out

4940650
width	height
canvas height 100 name canvas1 width 292

4940650
width	height
image canvas.left 0 canvas.top 0 height 440 name image1 stretch fill width 730

4940664
16-bit	64bit
64bit windows does not support 16-bit applications

4940668
trie	tree
if you need to do a substring match you can try using a suffix tree which is basically a trie but you also include the suffixes

4940680
vim	textmate
i m aware that other editors like vim and textmate have similar task lists

4940744
wav	ogg	wav	flac	wav	aiff	flac	ogg	flac	aiff	aiff	ogg

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
on firefox work great so as on opera but on google-chrome i don t get any response and no errors

4940868
mouse	keyboard
probably the best thing to do would be to use some sort of embedded processor like an arduino to sit between your keyboard mouse and the console to do the conversion

4940912
button	checkbox
short of writing custom controls or using custom drawables does android have any way to style or alter the appearance of basic controls like button checkbox etc in the xml where the control is declared

4940912
button	checkbox
or is there just one native style or appearance for all android checkbox button edittexts etc

4940915
integer	unsigned
however i have a field which is a unsigned 32-bit integer

4940932
width	height
but add in two more components for the width and height bounds

4940935
let	curry
since only one pattern matches you now have a new function -- let s call it curry

4940935
let	curry
let s call this inner curry function rice

4940935
sml	curry
i highly doubt sml names the curry functions in this way but i hope this does help to understand the concept

4940999
width	height
if you typically center your rectangles on something the center point width height and rotation angles might be more appropriate

4941000
int	double
it s generally a matter of increasing the range of values in an hsv sense representable so you can use rgb a where each element is a 16-bit int 32-bit int float double etc

4941005
hide	show
while your cursor on role1 press tab and see the way org-mode hide show the only relevant tree structure

4941047
int	double
introduce three more variables int lastaccount and double lastbalance

4941048
pop-up	dialog
if you re looking for a pop-up i suggest something like the jquery ui dialog

4941066
put	get
am i going to have to somehow get arrange matters so that i can put a break in the avalonedit source

4941083
postgresql	mysql
our dev db was mysql and apparently heroku has postgresql and it keeps complaining about as file_count for some reason

4941098
setinterval	settimeout
it pauses any video defers network request stops updating the ui and pauses all setinterval settimeout operations

4941200
pop-up	dialog

remember that 32-bit processes are only supported on 64-bit versions of windows in the dedicated windows-on-windows wow64 subsystem

4941571

the same issue is in play 013 in octal is 11 in decimal and 11 + 5 16

4941708

hash with salt passwords are a 1 one function so there is effectively no possible way of determining what the password was which means the user supplying the password has less to worry about

4941865
hash	md5
reversing an md5 hash

4941905
width	height
you can adjust the width of a picker but not height

4941914
width	height
which contains the value of one row input elements like height width length etc

4941914
width	height
this will check height only if width is null or height is not null

4941917
hash	md5
if you use a standard hash technique the user who has access to your database could put in the standard md5 for password for example

4941917
hash	salt
you can solve this issue with a salt hash which takes the input string and a salt string value to create a unique hash that can not easily be replicated

4941917
hash	salt
you now have a salt hash

4942072
prepare	execute
note that i have replaced the call to query with a couple of lines that call prepare then execute

4942072
prepare	execute
you can then easily insert the following lines in between the prepare and execute calls to handle passing parameterized queries

4942079
postgresql	mysql
i suspect there is some type of clever design perhaps built around a specialized database very different form mysql postgresql etc

4942089
hide	show	switching	screens
your best bet would probably be to store the last position recorded by the app in nsuserdefaults then wait for the precision to be where you want it to be before switching to live data or else hide the mkmapview until the precision is where you want it to be then display it at that point you could show a loading screens in the interim

4942108
width	height
so if it all possible you should try and make the width and height of your resized images a multiple of 16

4942772
versioning	upgrade
the benefit is for people who are still using the old versioning and for some reason does not want to or cannot upgrade to a newer versioning

4942775
vim	emacs
i have only started to use emacs but my succession was like that - our local editor home-msu-made then i have used vi vim for several years or sometimes far editor and finally 3 years ago i ve switched to emacs

4942775
vim	emacs
i must admit that i have not tried the modern capabilities of vim i ve heard that in functionality employed by a programmer vim and emacs are very close

4942775
vim	emacs
probably there will be someone who has changed from vim to emacs or vice versa - their opinion about pros and contras will be more mature than mine

4942815

4943106
width	height
you can mess with the imagebutton s scaletype properties to fitxy for example or cropcenter and by setting a fixed size to layoutpreferences height and width you ll be all set

4943133
hash	hmac
also standard hmac use has not been compromised but again longer hash are in principle more secure in that scenario

4943144
post	get
make sure you use a post request as the text may be too long to be sent by get that is appended to the url in a query string

4943144

versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade all my gems to the latest versioning including rails 3.0.4 which however looks like not quite related to this problem

4943774
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 8+ and firefox 4+ know what to do but i don t know about any others

4943816
getter	setter
best practices would suggest to define getter setter for fields which must be accessed from the outside

4943816
getter	setter
the doubt comes from the fact that eclipse seems comfortable with converting each in the class code to setfield field for fields which have getter setter even if i reading writing happens from inside the class code therefore i wouldn t need to use the class interface

4943816
getter	setter
common sense would suggest that using getter setter is similar to using c# properties but here i am specifically questioning about c# s automatic properties which only involve basic access without any processing

4943816
getter	setter
so the question is is there any good in calling getter setter with no additional processing from inside the class code

4943817
dictionary	map
are there any elegant quick way to map object to a dictionary and vice versa

4943818
hash	md5
in python if you want to compute some hash md5 sha1 there is hashlib module

4943858
getter	setter
getter setter encapsulates the things

4943858
getter	setter
so its better to use getter setter

4943858
getter	setter
for default value initilization you can use constructor. but if there is some processing while setting getting use getter setter

4943858
getter	setter
from outside class use getter setter

4943884
getter	setter
as i ve been taught using getter and setter inside the constructor is unnecessary and only creates extra method calls to slow down your program

4943893
button	checkbox
the alternatives to radio button are checkbox and drop down boxes

4943908
button	checkbox
i am using the jquery ui button element with a checkbox

4944412
range	min
it seems that since i did not mention a value for min sdk version my device treats the app as compatible to old versions and ignores the whole screen range support

4944412
screens	mdpi
it then defaults to medium screens and mdpi resources

4944441

mouseup	mousedown
this is a comment on thomas answer i don t have enough xp to comment yet the mousedown and mouseup workaround works nicely

4944814
mouseout	mousedown
just a note that if you make any changes in prepare_pdf that need undoing in save_pdf then its a good idea to call that code on the mouseout event as well since there might be a case that the user mousedown s on the button but then moves the mouse away from the button

4944814

4946178
inherited	properties
it simply inherited from the form class so that it gets all of the base functionality for free. a public properties is sort of like a global variable in that it allows other classes to access that value from outside but it s the preferred way of doing things in object-oriented languages

4946239
google-chrome	firefox
i d recomment use a tool like the google-chrome development tools or the web development tools for firefox and simply inspect the button which style you want to mimic

4946584
clang	llvm
clang llvm produced this

4946584
clang	llvm
i was hoping to get the compiler to at a minimum use the ldr rd rs #4 instruction which favors pointers and hoped the compiler would see that it could destroy the array address thus treating it like a pointer rather than an offset into an array and use the above instruction which is basically what clang llvm did

4946584
free	malloc
for me it readability comes into play and i feel arrays are easier to read and follow and second do i need to preserve that pointer to free a malloc or to go through that memory again etc

4946593
chown	chmod
you should be able to use chown to set the ownership and chmod to set the permissions

4946616
getter	setter
it should be bound to a property which is represented by a pure getter and setter

4946616
put	get
no setter is required since will use put and get on map itself

4946631
width	height
if you define the width and height in the html element this should work

you must to create setter and getter to the lessonsarray otherwise it won t work

4946704
viewdidload	dealloc
i had this second viewcontroller instance which would receive a viewdidload message followed by a dealloc message

which eliminates the index increment and replaces it with one multiplication outside and one division inside the loop executed just once in the return construct

4947492
opencv	emgucv
i m using emgucv which is a c# wrapper for opencv

4947499

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox safari google-chrome i guess too not in opera quite sure ie too but ie can be taken care of by activex file size but opera i am still stuck

4947753
opera	firefox
i have been fooling around with rapidshare to understand whats going on i realized even they use javascript file size checking p now that works great with firefox and the others like i said even ie as it has a fall back activex method but opera is the victim p they cant give a fancy javascript error in that case

4947756
hide	show
i have a menu item that i want to show hide only if the user has certain roles

4947773

if you want the differnce because of screensize you should find screensize but this is not really easy as there are tablet with small screens and phones with large screens

4947790
mef	prism
what i am trying to figure out is how to get started with prism + mef while maintaining the mvvm pattern

4947790
mef	prism
when i go into the prism quickstarts it has a prism + mef but the comments in the project specifically state that the quickstart example does not implement mvvm

4947790
mef	prism
every example online is either prism prism + mvvm prism + unity silverlight examples prism + mef etc

4947790
mef	prism
but i can not find any wpf prism + mef + mvvm examples or information

4947790
mef	prism
any help would be great especially resources that deal directly with this situation as apposed to something similar prism + unity and without mef

4947827
rss	feed
instead of parsing google news html it probably would be easier to parse its rss feed instead if there is one

4947857
google-chrome	safari
in addition to toscho s answer i ve noticed some webkit inconsistencies between google-chrome 9-10 and safari 5 with the css properties supported that are worth noting

4947868
int	double
it s work fine when t is int decimal double etc

4947891
move	drag
i am using the below code to rotate the drag dropped image.the rotation is working fine but when i start rotating the image move outside the div container .anything i am missing

4947920

4947920
jboss	glassfish	jboss	geronimo	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	geronimo	glassfish	weblogic	weblogic	geronimo
tested inside popular j2ee servers such as tomee geronimo jboss glassfish and weblogic

udp	tcp
supports pluggable transport protocols such as in-vm tcp ssl nio udp multicast jgroups and jxta transports

4947929
free	malloc
what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

4947950
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome chromium and opera have private mode in which session cookies aren t shared with other windows of the same browser create a private window with ctrl + shift + n

4947953
width	height
your button most likely has a height and width of zero and resides at position 0 0

4947963
int	chars
but if you replace chars with int then yes there would be difference because in that case malloc would allocate memory of size currentbytelength while new would allocate memory of size

4947974
button	checkbox
when the user clicks the dialog generate button i want jquery to tell me the names of all of the checkbox that are checked the name element of them so i can use those names to populate the div printing

4947986
int	chars
i mean both allocate data on the heap and when dealing with primitive types such as chars or int it s about the same

4947986
free	malloc
nothing prevents you from using malloc but don t mix those up do not call delete on memory allocated with malloc or free on memory allocated with new

4947995
free	malloc
they require different methods of freeing the memory malloc free vs

4948007
free	malloc
the most obvious difference is that memory that is malloc ed must be free ed while memory that is new ed must be delete d

4948011
free	malloc
if there s no constructor destructor you can call new malloc delete free interchangably and even with mixing

4948011
free	malloc
new and delete create the memory for a new object calling the constructor destructor if available while malloc and free just allocate the memory without calling constructor destructor

4948017
free	malloc
if the memory block is allocated with malloc you have to free it by calling free

4948087
post	get
which i hope is a completely different new instance of the form i get the error in the title of this post

4948109
opencv	emgucv
see documentation for initlineiterator sorry the link is to the python version of opencv i ve never heard of emgucv

4948120
put	get
well the easiest solution is to get a time machine go back in time to when the project was planned and tell the architect that you never put application logic into managed beans

4948125
rss	feed
here s what i ve got - i m writing an app that among other things reads an rss feed to get episodes of a certain podcast then displays each episode s title and description with a listen and watch button

4948136
for-loop	arrays
we made the 10 by 10 arrays using a nested for-loop and we have no issue creating the buttons

4948142
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome and maybe other browsers except internet explorer if first i m selecting a date with that pop-up calendar and than change it manually and then let the focus on the date field and going to save the document actually is a form with multiple fields the date changed manually it is lost the date choosed from calendar it is saved

4948142
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is reproducing in browsers like firefox google-chrome when

4948243
serializable	deserialization
the reason is that when you pass in any supported type to datacontractserializer on the first serializable or deserialization episode it shreds the type to an internal structure that contains all the information about the type s members etc

4948244
pull	push
well you can push and pull via git to the server you could potentially set up

4948264
pull	push
from to there i push and pull changes via ssh

4948265
int	double
or if you want to know seconds and not milliseconds you can truncate that double to int

4948267
pull	push
you could make the repository on any of your computers probably the desktop one and push pull to it from both laptop and itself

4948270
portrait	landscape
the way to recreate the error is to keep on rotating the device around 20-25 times so that app keeps on switching from portrait to landscape mode

4948270
portrait	landscape
if i switch between portrait and landscape mode pretty fast .

4948327
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is only supported in modern browsers ie8+ firefox 3.6.9 safari 4 and google-chrome

4948364
portrait	landscape
switching from portrait to landscape

4948365
hide	show
you can use the callback parameter in the show and hide methods like this

4948393
hash	md5
it can be anything from a simple crc32 to a full blown cryptographic hash function such as md5 or sha1 2 256 512

4948393
hash	md5
real hash functions do a lot more than 1 operation md5 does about 15 operations on 4 state variables

4948393
hash	md5
so instead take the hash of the file and store that md5 would store 16 bytes instead of 3mb

4948393
hash	hmac
for example if you re using hmac you sign a piece of data by taking a hash of the data concatenated with a known but not transmitted value a secret value

4948393
hash	hmac
so you send the plain-text and the hmac hash

4948393
hash	hmac
then the receiver simply hash the submitted data with the known value and checks to see if it matches the transmitted hmac

4948393
hash	salt
adding a salt helps matters since it adds a bit of unknown data to the hash

4948393
salt	md5
so instead of finding anything that matches md5 foo they need to find something that when added to the known salt produces md5 foo.salt which is very much harder to do

4948393
hash	salt
hash password + salt is better but still not good enough.

4948393
hash	salt
instead by re-appending the salt and password each time you re re-introducing data back into the hash function

4948411
int	double
1000000 rows of two int a double and an fk is a going to be pretty darn efficient

4948441
ceil	floor
you can use floor instead or ceil if you want to go the other way

4948484
children	parent
it would be similar to a parent table where the mother and father went off and had new children with a different spouse other than the spouse of there existing children

4948499
daemon	cron
would be great to have cron daemon dir containing scripts that should be run forever minutely but no more than 1 instance

4948499
jobs	cron
they are great but this quesion is about project cron jobs lightweight solution

4948522
put	get
what you could do is take the gps coordinates and put them into google maps to get the address

4948556
qmainwindow	qwidget
usr include qt4 qtgui qmainwindow.h 141 candidates are void qmainwindow setcentralwidget qwidget

4948581

for-loop	arrays
we ended up using a nested for-loop inside of actionperformed that ran through the 2d arrays and called the action methods from there

4948661
button	checkbox
the user is able to select checkbox the rows he wishes to print then clicks the print button

4948678
int	boolean
try converting your boolean to an int

4948708
filtering	grouping
construct a pivot table from the data then you can transpose and do a lot more besides filtering grouping etc

4948727
memcached	apc
you could either store the image as a file or store the imagick object in a memory object cache apc memcached etc. right after the clutimage call so you can composite it with other objects

4948763
free	malloc
to free the memory you need the pointer that malloc returned and call free on it

4948816
getter	setter
i m just curious to see how these practices fit in with the various ways of providing setter and getter in c#

4948816
getter	setter
why would should i do this over having dedicated setter and getter methods with associated processing and validation logic

4948845
getter	setter
you will get a backinng variable with separate getter and setter methods

4948846
getter	setter
note that i d call this a public property as both the getter and setter are public

4948850
getter	setter
use the auto property if all you need is a simple wrapper around an instance variable use the full version when you need to add logic in the getter and or setter

4948899
fuelphp	kohana
my options were fuelphp or kohana and as fuel isn t there yet what docs tutorials guides i should know about that could help me get up to speed

post	get	post	put	put	get
i ve created a restful api that supports get post put delete requests

4948932
post	get
if it s a jsonp requests it has a callback parameter in the querystring i force every api method to be executed by a get request even if it should be called by other methods like post or delete

4948958
filewriter	bufferedwriter
see jtable tablemodel filewriter bufferedwriter in the api docs

4948969
salt	md5
think also about using salt for the hashing defense against rainbow tables etc. and also have a look in slow hashing algorithms like bcrypt codeplex article how to safely store a password for security reasons instead of fast ones like md5

4948971
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it s working in firefox google-chrome opera but doesn t in all ie

4948979
pull	push
i think you should read on different techniques of writing xslt stylesheets push pull processing etc.

4948982
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
you should then verify the file type rename the file to something other than it s original file name and append the appropriate extension gif jpg bmp png

4949002
width	height
even if you are going to set the width and height in code you need to add these parameters to your xml-file for each imagebutton

4949003
children	parent
with regard to question 1 i have all my nodes implement all methods but the leaf entities return nil for the children getter method for example and the root returns nil for parent

4949042
getter	setter
also note that automatic properties require both getter and setter public or private

4949069
inherited	subclassing
the problem is that i can t find the way to inherited from mkpolyline because it doesn t have any init methods that i can call from the subclassing init

hash	md5
i am trying to compute md5 hash of a file with the function hashlib.md5 from hashlib module

4949166
dlsym	dlopen
you either use dlopen and dlsym or you make your own array of function names and function pointers and look it up that way

4949178
implements	extends
it s not quite the same thing but if all you are trying to do is determine if an object is of a certain type or extends implements a class interface then that should do the trick

4949287
x86	64bit
although a double in main memory is 64bit on x86 cpus double-precision registers are 80 bits wide

4949338
put	get
i have used a space at the beginning of the string to get the string at the top of the sorted list but i am looking to do something similar to put a string at the end of the list

4949345
onreadystatechange	onload
so no onreadystatechange onload onchange or other events does occur

4949361
put	get
if you can t modify the table you might be able to put the sortorder column into a different table and join to get it

4949386
post	get
and also a post how to get the separate digits of an int number

4949389
width	height
if the width height settings do not work like i have them above use avatar.attr width and avatar.attr height instead

4949415
google-chrome	firefox
this can be proven in firefox firebug google-chrome inspector and how the inherited style sheets are all over-written by the id s style

4949448
rss	feed
because of this flexibility i m creating the potential number of different rss feed coming from the site could be staggering thousands and thousands

4949448
rss	feed
but if someone is reading an rss feed through an online feed aggregator then won t their ip address be obscured

4949465
int	double
the error is pretty small for a double but is a big deal for an exact int

4949466
hide	show
i use alt+click to show or hide files of active task

4949479
post	get
you can convert your post request to a get request like this

4949485

even if you don t need them just add them so you can put a break point there to see if they get triggered

4949529
google-chrome	safari
it s working fine in google-chrome but not at all in ie8 or safari

4949530

unsigned	short
i have the following problem i have to read from an inputstream a sequence of data but due its own arrangement i need to read the first 4 bytes as an unsigned short 16 bits so in this way i will read two blocks of two bytes because the meaning of those bytes are numbers but after that i need to read as an unsigned byte because the meaning of all the remaining data is ascii

4950607
post	get
if not will post explanation after a bit got to get back to my day job

4950648
super	extends
i think it will be appropriate that stylesheetb extends stylesheeta so with one stylesheet parameter constructor of b can also construct its super class a

4950648
getter	setter
for example what if i decide to add a getter setter for the stylesheet

4950661
put	get
you can use the .get to fetch the code via ajax then get at the number in the return code and put into a div

4950677
getter	setter
in general i feel that a better way of doing this would be by using getter and setter and data binding or flex s invalidation methods which is described in that first link

4950714
post	get
in any mvc form post is sending to controller in action property in form and controller as the name is decribed controls what will happend in your case should ask database for verification via model get response decide what to do and use view to display results.

a low-tech way to get more information is to put basic timing logging into every rpc to see how long they take

4950869
getter	setter
a thoughts on the getter and setter issue

4950869
getter	setter
if you were just extending the class with a full parameter list you would have getter and setter for n101...n200 in b and n1...n100 in a

4950908
hash	md5
never use md5 its extremely broken sha1 is on the nist list of approved message digest functions but its kind of broken however the sha2 family is better sha256 is a great choice but you ll need to find the source code online for it because php doesn t have a secure hash function

4950941

in the general case you need to specify subprocess.pipe for the subprocess stdout and stderr

4951307
stdout	stderr
then create two separate threads which read the subprocess stdout and stderr to wherever you like

4951983
floating-point	integer
that avoids recalculating the function every pass through the loop and integer comparison may be faster than floating-point comparisons

int	double
i therefore instantiate two templates one for int and one for double

4952434

routines that calculate the position of elements in the dom tend to rely solely on the position of the element left top and the size of the element width height as all elements are rectangles this is fine the rectangular bounding box is identical to the object itself

4952625
width	height
when the item is rotated this ceases to be true so routines no longer work correctly as the width and height of the bounding box are potentially different to the object itself

4952625
width	height
the bounding box width and height is simple enough to calculate mathematically there was a question some time ago on this topic with an answer given by casablanca stating the mathematics to calculate the new widths and height

4952633

folder	directory
folder created using the solution explorer are not copied to the output directory where the executable lives by default unless an item that has been added to the project in that directory has the copy to output directory value set to something other than do not copy so if all you did was create an empty directory using the solution explorer then its likely the directory does not exist in the output path

4952690

folder	directory
the problem that i am having is that i want to create a new project in dreamweaver that is not using wordpress but because all those wordpress files are in the htdocs without a sub-directory it is giving me all sorts of warnings that issues could occur if i place a directory for my new project in the htdocs folder along side all those other files

4952856
int	boolean
is there a way to write a function that can return an int or a boolean

4952871
int	boolean
you might be able to remove the need to do something like this by qualifying what path you want outside of your function and then call a specific function to get a boolean or a specific function to get an int depending on the qualification

4952874
int	boolean
you can write a response object that encapsulates a boolean and an int together and set the values according to your whim

4952885
int	boolean
have it either return the boolean or int wrapper objects

4952919
google-chrome	firefox

4952958
cos	sin
if you re after a plain parametrization using sin and cos it s way easier

4952994
gridview	rowdatabound
i m not sure what you are trying to concatenate without a code example however i would perform the concatenation before binding the gridview and store it in a private member on the class so that you can access it later in the rowdatabound event

4952995
put	get
i thought i could just put that query in its own method and use a parameter to specify the orderby but i cannot get it to work

4953019
getter	setter
a couple of other options are to setup singleton classes that hold your shared values and that every activity can refer to or as a last resort you can extend the application class and create getter and setter to make values available across your application

4953029
post	put
the reason is that rails makes all form methods post but passes it s own _method parameter that is a put post or delete request

4953032
getter	setter
does this mean one is supposed to write tests for property getter and setter and other methods that contain no real logic such as dealing with external api functionality

vsto	add-in
in this vsto add-in we set a number of sharepoint 2010 meta properties that are returned from the documents contenttypeproperties collection

4953090
getter	setter
the only exception i can imagine is specific to .net and that s automatically implemented properties where there s no point in testing that the getter and setter work correctly because even if they didn t there d be nothing you could do about it

4953097
for-loop	arrays
what i would like to be able to do is to store in memory the arrays for each atom say atom_k and then call these different variables to perform further operations outside the for-loop

4953150
width	height
image width 1018 and height 916

4953166
getter	setter
most of us don t test-drive simple getter and setter specifically as part of the tdd process

4953166
getter	setter
but we re not creating that field which needs the getter and setter until we have a need for it - where need is defined as a failing test

4953166
getter	setter
so the getter setter will be tested as a matter of course because they re created as needed by methods we are test driving

4953179
width	height
this class is added to the textarea when using editorfor so you can specify the width and height in that class to get your desired dimensions

4967120
websphere	ibm
there are many such products i work for ibm so i know about websphere portal and lotus mashups to name but two

4967121
lxml	beautifulsoup
it s worth noting as jonathan vanasco does in the comments that beautifulsoup4 now supports using lxml as the internal parser so you can use the advanced features and interface of beautifulsoup without most of the performance hit if you wish although i still reach straight for lxml myself -- perhaps it s just force of habit

4967300
hide	show
how do i make it so that the menu only hide after it is show if you click outside of it

4967368
getter	setter
a far better solution would be to manually write the getter and setter methods by hand so that they emit these events if you re concerned about keeping code clean then these could always be moved into a trait

4967373
goto	break
it still is a command and this is a perfect example that no break or continue or some inline function can replace goto

4967386

4967430
ubuntu	linux
i m running on a linux ubuntu server

4967492
getter	setter
arguably in this example the type parameter is not very useful but in the design of dsls it would be great to have the setter method called even if the getter has type parameters and by the way adding type parameters on the setter is allowed and works fine

4967492
getter	setter
why does the compiler enforce a getter method to allow using the syntactic sugar for the setter

4967492
getter	setter
but alas the type parameter on the getter breaks the setter

4967493
verilog	vhdl
vhdl and verilog serve the same purpose but most engineers favor one of both languages

4967493

4967597
try-catch	exception-handling
from my knowledge there is no speed differences between a using statement of closin objects using a try catch block but i would recommend a usins statement over try-catch cleaner code and you don t risk forgetting to dispose objects or failing to because you did not catch an exception-handling

4967633
width	height
you cannot set height and width for elements with display inline

4967637
getter	setter
i tested it with simple monomorphic non-generic methods though it does require the getter method to be defined for the setter to be seen as such - a fact that you ve already noted

4967637
getter	setter
the rules for setter and getter definitions were based on using them as getter and setter so don t be surprised if things crack a little when you push at the boundaries like this

hash	md5
use a one-way hash like sha1 or md5 and use javascript to send the values as encrypted

4968104

one solution is to include a javascript parameter generated via your server-side language based on ip but not possible for a hacker to find the formula for and use it to salt the username and password hash

4968116
int	boolean
so far as i know when i want activity s to communicate to each other i have to use primitive type of objects such as int string boolean ...etc

4968121

google-chrome	firefox
for some strange reason the list items appear with a margin around them in both firefox and google-chrome

the same is true for the folder files in the timezone database but not for the files in the etc directory - they give a simple static offset to gmt

4969178
width	height
you can also do things like height + width 2

4969194
coalesce	isnull
you can use both isnull a b or coalesce a b c ... functions where isnull returns the value of b if a is null and coalesce returns the first non-null argument

4969194
coalesce	isnull
an important difference is that isnull forces the casting or convert of b to the type of a while coalesce s return type is the same of the returned argument letting the engine to try any conversion only after the evaluation of the function

4969194
coalesce	isnull
if the column a is of int data type writing isnull a 1 is ok but isnull a hello causes a conversion error while writing coalesce a hello is allowed and an error will be raised only if a is null and you try for example to insert the returned value hello to an int column but doing auotmatic conversion of a s value if not null when inserting in a varchar column

if you don t want to subclass yourself you can use one of the nsoperation subclasses ie nsinvocationoperation or nsblockoperation

first of all most windows installs come with file access times disabled for performance reasons so before wrapping your head around it here is what you need to do in order to activate last access times on ntfs filesystems modify the key value name ntfsdisablelastaccessupdate to dword 0 value data if it is set to 1 of course

4970153
ant	maven
also maven projects come with a different directory structure and seems to be doing much more than what ant does in the spring source tutorial

4970153
ant	maven
but as i checked-out some example apps from spring source repo and it seems that maven is more preferred and powerful than ant

4970603

swing	windowbuilder
i have very limited swing-experience and perhaps i d be better off studying the swing api instead of looking for windowbuilder documentation

webclient	httpwebrequest
you can just use httpwebrequest or webclient to make web requests like you would have with curl in your php client.

4970669

4970901
couchbase	couchdb
as of june 2015 gives 404 not found since at least march 2013 couchone on twitter had last tweets in may 2011 and says that couchone is now couchbase inc. - but please note that contrary to some marketing material the couchbase server is not a continuation of couchdb - it has a different code base licensing philosophy features data and protocols

4970901
couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb
for more info on this and an explanation of differences between things like couchdb couchio couchone couchbase couchbase server couchbase mobile couchbase lite couchapps bigcouch touchbase membase memcached memcachedb etc.- see the answer that i wrote to difference between couchdb and couchbase in march 2013

postgresql	mysql
i do not believe that mysql or postgresql support parallel queries though

4970959

what i can t seem to figure out is how to put all these tools together to get a successful expression for the type iâ need

4970960
hash	md5
or add another cookie set only once never expire having a likely-unique value md5 hash

4970982
client-side	server-side
i suppose you could in theory link to your server-side repository interface files from the silverlight client using the wcf service as the actual data source for your client-side implementation of irepository

4970993
comparator	comparable
the bean comparator link has a simple example of implementing comparable creating a custom comparator or using the beancomparator so you don t need to write any custom code

4971025
getter	setter
i will just make all the instance variables in this class public although you should probably rather have them private with the usual getter and setter methods note that i am also omitting package and import statements

4971049
oncreate	onnewintent
then in your activity oncreate you have to make a getintent and check if it has the result also you need to implement onnewintent callback so you are notified if your activity is currently running an receives the intent with the data you have to call getintent also in this callback

4971086
innodb	myisam
if it proceeds then either you re not on innodb maybe it s disabled and mysql s silently transforming to myisam the key checks are turned off check that server variable or something s really screwy with your server

4971127
cvs	svn
that work needs to be finished to be committed is left-over cvs svn thinking

4971169
jmeter	soapui
soapui or jmeter see

from a unit testing perspective you are better off encapsulating your functionality in a separate library project that you can then test using the standard unit test frameworks nunit mstest

4971232
ceil	floor	ceil	math.h	floor	math.h
i think you need double ceil double x to get the smallest value or double floor double x to get the largest value both included in math.h

4971309
disk	ram
you could also consider a ram disk ram drive if you really want performance and want to have it stored on a filesystem

4971337
pull	push
any command you ve previously used in mercurial commit push pull summary id etc

4971356

back when the app was written the developers used onmousemove to display the info instead of onmouseover

4971512
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i don t know if this has something to do with it but if you read the documentation for the initwithstring method it returns an instance of a subclass of nsstring which may or may not be an instance of nsmutablestring

4971512
nsmutablestring	nsstring
doesn t do what anyone wants when you synthesize the accessors as the setter invokes -copy and gets an nsstring which is not an nsmutablestring as a result

4971549
google-chrome	firefox
we tested it out and the gradient is now working with or without a theme in ie7 8 firefox and google-chrome

maven	pom.xml
i have added the maven groovy plugin to the pom.xml such that i can build test the java and groovy sources on the command-line using maven

4971768
groupbox	panel
i ve tried creating a custom panel that inherits panel and a groupbox but these didn t work any differently

4971768
inherited	properties
in the inherited form from above the designer s location properties for the refreshbutton and savebutton are 371 7 and 452 7 even though the containing panel is only 445 pixels wide

4971793
put	get
is there a way to get vs 2010 to put these specified fields back in

4971838
outputstream	inputstream
if the images are however to be retrieved from an external resource as for example a database then you need to create a servlet which obtains an inputstream of the image from the external resource based on the parameters pathinfo provided by the http request and writes it to the outputstream of the http response along a set of correct response headers content type length etc

4971872
subtraction	addition
in your case addition and subtraction there are built-in operations in pycuda that you can use to your advantage

4971875

pd remember use the same name in post to get the data _post xyzname

4971895
width	height
and possibly set height and width of the new nerdtree window so it doesn t keep moving with new files

4971912
mouse	keyboard
i am able to scroll it with mouse events but no luck with the keyboard so far

4971931
subtraction	addition
that being said i m afraid that i m not aware of any vcs that tracks movement of code between files just addition to the target and subtraction from the source

4971947
post	get
one of them is called to handle get operations and another is used to handle post operations

4971953
jar	war
i know with java you can release the source code as a war or jar but does php have something like this

4971965
jar	war
the rough equivalent to war or jar would be phar

4971979
filtering	grouping
first i create a grouping observable filtering messages by their unique id and then i am trying to cache all messages in each grouping until i have collected them all then i sort them and put them together

4971983
jar	war
take a look at phar as a php alternative to jar war

4972012
daemons	systemd
if the xml file will be placed in a systemd defined folder a windows service or linux daemons could be built to watch permanently on real time that path to transfer the updated data

4972016
folder	directory
i would like parent directory of projects to include an hgrc file that a repo in that folder inherits from

4972043
punctuation	words
personally given this setup i d work with the innertext property of htmlnode to find the words probably with regex so i can exclude for punctuation and not simply rely on spaces and then use the innerhtml property to make the changes using iterative calls to regex.replace because the regex.replace has a method that allows you to specify both start position and number of times to replace

4972083
versioning	upgrade
i have sts versioning 2.3.2 shall i upgrade and how

4972093
put	get
this is probably pretty simple but i m trying to take the value from an element in xml and put it in my datagridtextcolumn formatted to 3 decimal places but i can t get it to work...it just leaves it unformatted at like 20

4972132
iboutlet	ibaction
you will set up variables and methods for button clicks and etc to handle each component from ib a textfield or button is an iboutlet while an action like clicking on a button is an ibaction as far as best design i believe you should have a delegate for each view that does all the above but i generally just use the viewcontroller as the delegate and implement it there for relatively simple views

4972172
put	get
if you want to get clever you can also use ctrl-r to pull things onto the search box put the cursor on a word press then press and hold ctrl and press r then w and it will pull the word under the cursor onto the search line similar to pressing but editable and without the word boundaries

4972178
ilist	icollection
note that does not extend ilist and does not extend icollection

4972178
ilist	icollection
whereas any generic iterator can be seen as a nongeneric iterator due to the potentially boxing conversion of any value to object ilist and icollection allow values to be added to the collection

4972178
ienumerable	ienumerator
with ienumerable we had to effectively cast often implicitly in a foreach statement each element that was returned from the sequence because the current property of ienumerator is just of type object

4972200
entity-relationship	diagram
aqua data studio offers an entity-relationship diagram generator and entity-relationship modeler but it s pricey now

in a webserver like apache or nginx this is taken care of for you and usually defaults to index.html index.htm if either exists it will get served when going to a directory with no actual filename on the end

4972330
apache	nginx
when everyone says this is built into passenger i think they really mean that it s built into apache nginx

4972330
apache	nginx
apache nginx will check if the static file exists and serve it if it does the request will never get to rack which is awesome for performance

4972331
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you want to initialize the button to be disable you may put this code in the viewdidload viewwillappear depending on the context of your application

4972339
youtube	vimeo
i believe the regex expression is retring more then it should and i would like to retrive only the urls that it finds not every reference of vimeo or youtube

4972350
apache	nginx
this is better for performance as you don t have to go through the sinatra rack stack just to serve static text which is what apache nginx are awesome at doing

4972377
imperative	declarative
we can state that hive is declarative and sit on higher level of abstraction then imperative pig

4972460

other than setting attributes css. replacewith inserts the value before the next elements

4972464
super	extends
and let all the projects extends from the super pom

4972464
super	extends
so every other project pom will have a parent section to extends from the super pom like this

4972492
children	parent
the first half of the union query should represent the parent and the second should return the children

4972537

4972540
google-chrome	firefox
just keep in mind that gpu support for canvas at the moment works only on windows - so you d have to take all the osx running machines out of equation and only in ie9 google-chrome 11 and firefox 4 - all of them either rc betas or dev builds

4972554
submit	submission
for instance rather than submission the full path c users ericlaw documents secret image.png internet explorer 8 will now submit only the filename image.png

4972563
post	get	post	put	put	get
i have a restful controller that has your standard rest http verbs get post put delete

4972563
post	get
the problem i am having is that although my controllers are decorated to accept these verbs when i execute my rest action it can only hit my get and post methods

4972563
put	get
what do i need to do to get iis 7.5 to handle rest verbs like put and delete with asp.net mvc 3

4972568

the first line is a forward-declaration of a different struct whose name clashes with the typedef

4977633
typedef	struct
when the error message indicates that ttf_font is actually a typedef not a struct

4977633
typedef	struct
you can declare the same typedef multiple times so you can just use the typedef declaration instead of the forward declaration to declare the struct and introduce the typedef although it does feel a bit like you are using implementation details of the header that you are trying to defer including

ok so after a lot of tinkering it seems that the reason for this behavior lies in the plugins installed on safari and firefox 3.6 it seems

4980550
nunit	mstest
there are several reasons for preferring nunit over mstest but with regards to this particular issue the compelling reason is that the only class-wide initialisation method supported by mstest that doesn t run for every test is for static methods which is not what i m looking for

4980721
bazaar	git
before i comment on your question specifically i would recommend that you look at one of the dvcs distributed version control systems like git mercurial and bazaar

4980721
cvs	svn
svn was a huge step-forward from cvs and definitely was a the tool to use in its day

4980721
cvs	svn
but the reality is that dvcses are an even bigger step forward over svn than svn was over cvs

4980721
bazaar	git
essentially the same model would be followed - with variations - if you used git mercurial or bazaar

ubuntu	debian
1.8.7 is available and usable in debian ubuntu install the ruby-full meta package via apt

4980786
put	get
i ve used jquery to get the xml and put the submenu s into an array

4980831

personally i like django but your mileage may vary i would say though that whatever you do with python and the web will require some sort of framework even if it s one of the absolute minimal ones like flask which basically do just the routing part

4980844
getter	setter
you can also use public properties without concerning yourself if they are private fields with getter and setter java properties c# or generated object methods using metaprogramming ruby

4980872
ant	maven
because ant gradle and maven are unit-testable too

4980896

4981070
width	height
then in properties you can select add the pixels 200px on width height

4981088
post	get
if you go for javascript i m assuming it would run in a browser and therefore to communicate with anything else it would make http requests post or get urls so the client server arrangement is unavoidable

4981102
for-loop	loops
notice that in this loops you only change the value of child in the nested for-loop but never elsewhere

4981151
uiview	subviews
then as the uiview is moved by the user dragging touching the subviews is moved in relation to that to create a magnify effect

4981168

to add a table view you would create a uitableviewcontroller or a generic uiviewcontroller with a uitableview embedded in it this depends on your needs and put it in your uitabbarcontroller viewcontrollers property

4981174
virtualenv	setuptools
so pip and virtualenv sound wonderful compared to setuptools

4981197

children	parent
i m trying to write some code which uses pipes to communicate between a parent process and it s children

4981245
textmate	textwrangler
that forces me to open subject file in some editor like textmate or textwrangler because these two handle large files much better than eclipse

4981245
textmate	textwrangler
i assume this is because eclipse is driven on a java vm and probably textmate and textwrangler aren t not sure though

4981245
textmate	textwrangler
therefore i m wondering if someone could recommend some good ide for php js for mac osx not based on java vm textmate and or textwrangler are too narrowed to be used as ide

4981264
filtering	grouping

4981302
put	get
which changes get put in

4981309
post	get	post	put	put	get

4981490
accessor	properties
because the object returned from the get accessor is autoreleased in the current scope it remains valid if the properties value is changed

4981490
getter	setter
the performance of technique 2 is significantly better than technique 1 in situations where the getter is called much more often than the setter

4981490
getter	setter
the approach used by technique 3 is good for frequently called getter and setter methods

4981501
google-chrome	firefox
how to i modify it to work in google-chrome as well as firefox

4981529
tunnel	vpn
assuming you are using a real vpn and not just a browser based proxy solution then the vpn should encrypt and tunnel all of your network traffic this includes anything coming out of any port on your computer not just http traffic

4981529
tunnel	vpn
there are some vpns which allow for split traffic split tunnel traffic to certain domains gets tunneled through the vpn and others goes in the clear but this is the rarity most vpns will tunnel all of your traffic which seems to be what you are looking for

4981544
google-chrome	firefox
working in google-chrome and firefox

so what i did was have the left right functions add subtract small amounts onto an angle variable that is used to draw the character s rotation

4981622
subtract	add
then the forward backward functions add subtract small amounts to the x and z axes variables

4981622
cos	sin
i thought this would work because when the player is going straight forward the heading is 0 and so cos 0 1 and sin 0 0 which means they move nowhere on the x but forwards the full 0.005 amount on the z

4981638
innodb	myisam
these are supported by innodb backends but not myisam tables but it supports a concept called atomic operations

4981690

4981915
google-chrome	safari
here both google-chrome and safari and taking #555 color first and then #ccc

4981915
google-chrome	safari
how do i differentiate between google-chrome and safari so that i can style them differently

4981916
switching	screens
although you can keep it under the lock screens you will not be able to switching to other processes only to a very limited extent and under specific conditions

4981932
google-chrome	safari
both safari and google-chrome have a problem with this

4981946
nswindow	nsmenuitem
i have an application with an nsmenuitem that launches a separate window and i was wondering if it would also be possible to add a hot-key combination so that it would be possible to also invoke the nswindow via that as well

post	put
seriously put together the minimal complete code sample that generates the error and post that

4981957

4982019
nswindow	nsstatusitem
i have an application that upon activation is backgrounded and has an nsstatusitem icon which can be clicked to either close the application or open an nswindow

4982019
nswindow	nsstatusitem
currently i can click the icon and then press command+option+t and the nswindow will activate but what i can t do is press the key combo without first clicking the nsstatusitem

4982066
h.264	webm
the latest versions of chrome do not support h.264 video so your issue in that case may be lack of an ogg webm fallback

4982107
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however if you ever decide to open up to mobile devices iphone ipad android webos blackberry 6 html5-compatible web browsers safari google-chrome firefox opera ie9 or pretty much anything newer than 5 years ago h.264 is definitely the way to go

4982114
width	font-size	width	height
with different sizes width font-size you should be able to choose the appropriate padding by calculating height - fontsize 2 perhaps give or take a pixel or two for perfection

4982123
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

4982166
hide	show
then show everything whose lang matches the language and hide everything whose lang doesn t match

4982166
hide	show
if you keep the show hide logic in a separate function that takes a language argument then it would be pretty easy to provide a language selection widget of some sort too

4982178
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my application is intended to only work with more modern browsers such as ie7+ firefox google-chrome safari and newer opera however it still works somewhat in ie6

now the real question is which problems would arise internationalization localization accuracy etc.

4982246
vim	textmate
i am trying vim coming from textmate

4982271
git-rebase	amend
git-rebase amend seems inefficient when you have the power of filter-branch at your fingertips

4982290
width	height
also you can use width and height to retrieve the dimensions of the element

4982309
comparator	comparable
you need to implement the comparator method in your item class and declare it to implement the comparable interface

4982314
comparator	comparable
but since you want to sort by two different things implementing comparable won t get you very far it s better to use a comparator

4982332
content-disposition	content-type
update ok if using your own bandwidth is not an issue then all you need to be doing is outputting the files binary content to the browser and setting the relevant http headers ie content-type and content-disposition

4982398
put	get
the problem i m having though is that the photos user route is either interpreted as the show method or if i put those custom routes before the resources then routes like new get interpreted as the user method

4982438
instances	transient
with gorm you have to save and attach in a bottom up fashion or when grails goes to flush the connection for the next instances you will get the transient instances exception

4982438
instances	transient
the instances is transient because its just an in-memory reference

4982443
hide	show
within the detailsview i have a number of asp panels that i d like to show hide depending on what s happening in that person s visit

4982443
hide	show
so to show hide panels within the detailsview on postback will i always have to set visibility on detailsview_prerender or after

4982480
width	height
i was expecting that when i set the padding-top property it would take the padding as a percentage of the height of the parent container which is base in our case but the above value of 50 percent is calculated as a percentage of the width

4982480
margin	height
is there a way to set the padding and or margin as a percentage of the height without resorting to using javascript

4982486
free	malloc
actually i can t find anything obviously wrong with your memory or file handling in the code above the crash on free might just be a symptom of something in your code writing into malloc s personal space.

4982491
hide	show
is it a show hide script that i need

4982540
post	get
all the requests get and post are successfully able to route to tomcat server except the file upload multipart post form submissions

4982702
gmail	hotmail
until i ve implemented a separate compose widget i m planning to special case the mailto links for users with gmail yahoo hotmail etc

4982719
ftell	fread
if ftell returns -1 then malloc would allocate a buffer for 0 bytes but the fread would attempt to read up to 4 gb of data which might overflow the space

4982719
ftell	fread
otoh if ftell fails it is likely that fread will fail too

4982721
uiview	subviews
basically the process is the same you create a uiview add the buttons images as subviews and then return it on the method

4982730
getter	setter
you might want to use a property with retain and then synthesis the getter and setter methods

4982741
width	height
your first linearlayout says fill_parent for both height and width so it will take up all the room

4982785
internationalization	localization
depending on what technology you re using this concept is known as string externalizing string resourcing string internationalization localization etc

4982793
children	parent
then you just create your children views and add them to the parent view with addsubview

4982793
children	parent
keep in mind that all your views are kept in memory until you remove them from the parent view using the children view s removefromsuperview method

4982817
for-loop	loops
you need to add a while loops or for-loop as in

4982850

you can use box-sizing border-box

4982851
calloc	malloc
it frees only the memory allocated in the corresponding call to malloc calloc

4982851
valgrind	memcheck
i should add that a good way to know if you are leaking memory or not is to test your program with the valgrind memcheck tool

4982855
portrait	landscape
the orientation change is handled by my application but when it is switched back to portrait the application remains in the landscape view

4982900
width	height
i found out that many of writers suggest to use value for div s width or height

4982900
width	height
why should i use value for div s width or height instead of pixels

4982905
fgets	fread
better yet use fgets instead of fread

4982933
autocomplete	autosuggest
can someone recommand a good autocomplete or autosuggest that uses javascript or jquery

4982949
put	get
you can put your line of code in a method and have that get called by an nstimer

4982963
portrait	landscape
but once i start changing the orientation it shows the image in correct position in both landscape and portrait modes

4982969
int	boolean
these are returning compile errors like expected value found int and incomparable types java.lang.object and boolean

4982988
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseenter and mouseleave are not registering until the cursor hits something visible

4982988
mouseover	mouseout
edit question do mouseover and mouseout show the same weird behavior

4983016
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
use the mouseenter mouseleave events instead the mouseover and mouseout fire multiple times

4983080
width	height
you specify whether or not the borders should remain where they are relative to its parent and whether the width and height are stretchable if needed

4983081

4983101
hide	show
btw this code always hide all the cell blocks and show cell6 which does not exist in my code

4983101
hide	show
so how do i iterate over an array and show hide my cells

4983162
int	double
you cast the double to an int which is always 0

4983174
glibc	newlib	toolchain	newlib	bare-metal	uclibc
for instance if you have a toolchain for arm glibc-based systems it will work to compile programs for standard arm linux systems that use glibc but won t work on arm uclinux systems that use uclibc or on arm bare-metal systems using newlib

4983187
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox work fine but ie7 when using ie7 the server will response the first update i have since i clear ie7 cache

4983192
post	get
apparently original developer had never heard of sql-injection because he s using post and get variables directly in his sql statements

4983210
move	drag
through it you can let the user drag an object on the screen access where it is when it s stopped being move and so on

4983220
post	get
however if what you say is true it s quite likely that the original developer didn t know much about magic_quotes so it s likely he messed up if he ever stored the get post cookie values anywhere else except sql statements

4983234
hide	show
it will hide them so when entering a group mailbox folder it will only show you mail that are unread or ticked

4983244
int	double
now you will have those value in int double

4983270
client-side	server-side
you re confusing client-side and server-side events

4983320
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest on the other hand thinks in resources - you have a customer resource and issuing an http get on that resource uri retrieves the customer a put would insert a new customer post would update an existing customer and delete all http verbs will delete your customer

4983335
google-chrome	firefox
frankly the page is neither fast in ie nor firefox nor google-chrome

4983335
google-chrome	firefox
but its relatively faster in firefox and google-chrome much than ie

4983335
google-chrome	firefox
i suppose it has something to do with the different mechanisms of firefox google-chrome and ie use handling contents

4983338
uiview	subviews
i have added a uiview in ib targetview and have added 4 labels as subviews to this

4983338
hide	show
i want to show hide this container view to actually show hide the 4 labels inside it

4983369
getter	setter
you could look into custom getter setter __definesetter__ functions for firefox and create a setter for the location property of window

4983406
onresume	onpause
for dynamically registering unregistering of broadcastreceiver s you have to remember the instance of your receiver in onpause to register it again during onresume

4983422
stateless	stateful
should you ever need jpa s extended persistence context then the stateful session bean is practically made for that otherwise the stateless session bean would be used for daos

4983430
aggregate-functions	sum
the having operator is to be applied to aggregate-functions - if you want to pick those rows where a sum exceeds a certain value or something

4983441
width	height

the normal way to handle equals and compareto is to return false for equals or throw classcastexception for compareto if the arguments actual type doesn t match the actual type of this

4983696
equals	compareto
if you try to implement equals or compareto for subtypes you can easily create semantic anomalies such as

1 how do you create secure blowfish hash of passwords with crypt

4983702
comparator	comparable
per class only one comparator method can be used to implement the comparable interface

4983710
comparator	comparable
i would thus completely avoid to implement comparable in the task class and use a dedicated comparator when sorting a collection of tasks

4983721
inherited	properties
because all these inherited their properties and methods from domnode it is essential to familiarize yourself with the domnode class

4983963
g++	gcc
use g++ instead of gcc

4983987
hash	salt
salt is use to prevent rainbow attacks by breaking the match between the password and precomputed hash

4983996

4984044
hash	salt
a salt is a random set of bytes of a fixed length that is added to the input of a hash algorithm

4984044
hash	salt
adding a random salt to a hash ensures that the same password will produce many different hash

4984044
hash	salt
the salt is usually stored in the database together with the result of the hash function

4984044
hash	salt
this is only true if the salt is stored separate from the hash

4984044
hash	salt
8 character case-sensitive alpha-numeric passwords with 16 bit salt hash to a 128 bit value would take up just under 200 exabytes without rainbow reduction

4984044
hash	salt
a salt is not a secret key instead a salt works by making the hash function specific to each instance

4984044
hash	salt
with salt hash there is not one hash function but one for every possible salt value

4984044
hash	salt
a secret salt is not a salt it is called a key and it means that you are no longer computing a hash but a message authentication code mac

4984044
hash	salt
this ensures that an attacker has to attack every salt hash separately

4984044
hash	salt
the point of the salt is to be distinct for each hash password

4984044
prng	random
using a random salt obtained from a cryptographically secure unpredictable prng may be some kind of overkill but at least it provably protects you against all those hazards

4984409
crypt	salt
salt for a crypt algorithm is only a small part of the security problem

4984409
hash	salt
note that algorithms like sha-512 and blowfish can return the salt as part of their hash

4984409
hash	salt
be careful with these as if you store the complete hash you give away the algorithm which means there s two less thing for the hackers to figure out the salt also gives away the algorithm

4985446
addition	multiplication
you can implement multiplication using only bit shifts a few bit comparisons and addition

4985446
subtract	add
if you want to produce normal ieee floating point numbers a few parts get a bit ugly though -- for example the scale factor is stored as a bias number instead of any of the usual 1 s complement 2 s complement etc. so working with it is clumsy basically each operation you subtract off the bias do the operation check for overflow and assuming it hasn t overflowed add the bias back on again

4985446
verilog	vhdl
for quite a few computer architecture classes it s interesting to reduce a problem to primitive operations you can express directly in hardware bit shifts bitwise- and - or and - not etc. the implementation shown above fits that reasonably well if you want to get technical an adder takes a few gates but vhdl verilog etc. but it s included in things like vhdl and verilog anyway

mixins are related to inherited in that an object receives properties or methods from another object but are typically not limited in number

4985601
stdout	stdio	stdout	stderr
this means you can t redirect the child process stdio but you can explicitly write something into its stdin and read from its stdout and stderr using the corresponding process methods or to be precise the corresponding methods of input output streams returned by the getinputstream getoutputstream geterrorstream methods of the process class

4985601
outputstream	inputstream
you can use some sort of imitation of ipc with threads using custom inputstream outputstream implementations or you may wish to have a look at the pipedinputstream pipedoutputstream pair

org.springframework.beans.notreadablepropertyexception invalid property adr of bean class form.user bean property adr is not readable or has an invalid getter method does the return type of the getter match the parameter type of the setter

4986143
accessor	properties
if you don t need to do any operations in the accessor use a auto-implemented properties

4986150
move	drag
i think it would be simpler to put one transparent div covering everything and then handling the drag of the video yourself using the mousedown move up handlers in the transparent div instead of doing all this trickery for the buttons

4986172
button	checkbox
even scripts where you specifically include the id of the checkbox will still cause the radio button to toggle

4986172
button	checkbox
even though the function takes the id of the checkbox it will affect the radio button in the form the last radio button will end up being selected

4986172

4986220
int	chars
there is no guarantee of the size of any of the built-in types like int chars and the like

4986232
integer	unsigned
edit it s unfortunate that earlz deleted his answer because his idea was actually better than he thought if a c99 implementation has a 16-bit unsigned integer type it s required to provide uint16_t as a typedef for that type

4986237
mouseleave	mouseenter
this was achieved by adding event handlers to the menustrips mouseenter and mouseleave events to display and remove the text

4986237
mouseleave	mouseenter
the problem i am having is that i am now using a mainmenu control instead of a menustrip and since it doesn t derive from control it doesn t have mouseenter and mouseleave events

4986239
unsigned	short
therefore the size of a short or unsigned short may be larger than what i just posted above

4986250

getter	setter
i know that a var implicitly gets two methods with it a getter and a setter

4986365
free	malloc
there are plenty of options other than increasing or decreasing one of which is that each function call performs the equivalent of malloc to obtain memory for the callee s automatic storage calls the callee and performs the equivalent of free after it returns

i m trying to get the filenames that are stored on the sd card so i can put them in a listview

4986508
inherited	properties
i d expand point 2 to say all properties that you want to store must be public and read write for integer properties you can get away with having read only properties and it won t try to save them but you don t actually have to inherited from tableserviceentity

4986508
inherited	properties
all of these things you can do to a class that you create yourself and doesn t inherited from tableserviceentity note that the casing of these properties is important

4986518

upgrade to newer versioning of google maps should be less time consuming because you already have working code and even though you make will have to make big changes you should be able to reuse some parts of the codebase

4986567
folder	directory
however i think it s the best to keep all files in the project home folder unless they are used across multiple projects and therefore your version control repository only contains a single root directory the project home for your project

4986630
int	chars
this will handle any unsigned int although large numbers will have an awful lot of m chars at the front and the caller has to ensure their buffer is large enough

4986636
uiview	subviews
it is possible that while your uitextview exists as it becomes a subviews of one of your uiview object addsubview retains the subviews the myviewcontroller object itself is released from the memory after you build up your view hierarchy

4986686
int	chars
for your second question is 8 because the size of an int is 4 the chars is 1 and the string starts at the next 8-byte boundary you are probably on a 64-bit system

4986695
lisp	scheme
it s exactly the same as scheme s begin or common lisp s progn

4986717
lxml	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup 3.1 supports python 3 but is also deemed a failed experiment and you are told not to use it so in practice beautifulsoup doesn t support python 3 yet leaving lxml as the only alternative

4989363
inline	inlining
suppose i look through some project without understanding what goes inside it and decide myself that one third of functions are small enough and good for inlining and mark them with __forceinline and the compiler does inline them and now the executable has become say one hundred times bigger

4989384
getter	setter
the safe and time tested approach is to use getter and setter on your objects ie you only allow access to the variable through object methods like getx setx

4989402
mouse	keyboard
there s getasynckeystate which is both for the keyboard and the mouse

4989450

4990201
getter	setter
yes for trivial get set testing i d only use one method per property maybe depending on the case even only one method for the whole class for value objects with many getter and setter i don t want to write maintain many tests

4990201

sudo	passwd
1 depending on your code and its security model you may be able to collect the user s passwd and use su sudo 2 to run a separate command-line program to run the actual operations outside of the web server environment but su sudo are able to do this because they re suid root and it would still open up most all of the issues associated with running cgi code as root anyhow

2 sudo could even be configured to allow it without requiring a passwd but there be dragons down that path

stringstream	fstream
when working with a c++ std iostream for example std fstream or std stringstream does the standard guarantee anything about the relationships between reads and writes performed on the same stream

4991818

4992927
hash	md5
md5 should indeed generate the same hash given the same input parameters however without specific implementation details it s hard to say what would cause the difference you see

4992936
hash	salt
it is different because asp.net membership provider assigns a different salt with each different user so you get different hash even if user name is same

4992936
hash	salt
because internally the mix of salt and same password will always match to the their respective hash

4992937
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
md5 is a deterministic algorithm therefor you re probably experiencing salt hash

4992950

i have read a lot of other so posts on the topic but none of the solutions given work on firefox although there is an ie7 8 and google-chrome solution

4993365
children	parent
the case is that i have a parent page focusareas which has a number of static children child01 child02 child03 etc. these children are as mentioned static and do not change or change very little over time but the thing is that there will be some blog posts which are related to them â but the blog posts also have to function as an independent entity

4993505
folder	directory
i would use winmerge and compare the two directory recursively ignoring .svn folder

4993524
google-chrome	firefox
the reason seems to be the #content div which has a different height in ie7 vs ie8 firefox google-chrome

4993541
cpu	processors
cpu speed is unlikely to be your bottleneck anyway given modern processors speeds - most web applications don t really need much cpu power

4993619
google-chrome	firefox
this should work in firefox and google-chrome for other browsers you ll probably need to add alternative encodings

4993636
facebook	fbconnect
so if you want fbconnect to work on your local machine you have to configure a dyndns entry that refers to your ip and associate it with your facebook app

4993659
struts	stripes
you should put this kind of code in a servlet or in an action of your favorite mvc framework struts stripes spring mvc etc.

you asked specifically about generating a getter setter pair

4993686
getter	setter
for a property with a getter setter i type

4993768
rss	feed
it s something like rss feed reader but with local db

4993769
post	get
however if you try to load the address of the ajax request itself in your browser replacing post parameters with get parameters if needed you will get a normal debug page

4993789
move	drag
to move a class from one package to another in eclipse you can simply drag the source-code file into the desired package and eclipse will refactor the code accordingly

4993842
put	get
however i believe get parameters are put into the request object by default so you shouldn t need to cater for them in your routes

4993861
cassini	iis
however the identity that resides within this request context ultimately depends on how the web site iis cassini iis express or custom handles identity

4993884
post	get
install firebug or use the safari develop menu to see what ajax xhr requests are being done to the server and with what post get parameters

jboss	glassfish
it is my understanding that you could implement bos 5.4 either in jboss glassfish or apache tomcat

4993913
swing	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swt	windowbuilder
that being said there is no substitute for a solid understanding of the underlying technology that you plan on using within windowbuilder be it swt swing or gwt

4993913
swing	windowbuilder	swt	swing	swt	windowbuilder
sadly most tutorials are still centered around hand-coding the gui so there is an opportunity for an enterprising documentation tutorial writer to provide a gateway to those who wish to learn technologies like swing and swt using windowbuilder

4993977
listview	gridview
for example changing a listview to a gridview to show data on a button click

4994013
post	get
edit based on questioner s comments if modifying a number in a url is all that is required to point to records the user is unauthorized to use would post perhaps be a better method to use than get

4994055
udp	tcp
udp is also defined at this level and can be thought of as an extremely light-weight tcp

4994055
udp	tcp
udp provided almost none of the beneifts of tcp but still provides the physical channel multiplexing

4994055
udp	tcp
if your transport layer is written well your applications don t need speaking from a code architecture standpoint to worry about whether the transport layer is using tcp or udp just mentioning these two b c the yare most popular on ip

4994063
document.write	window.open
i am using the window.open function and i have set the title of the page using the document.write function see code below

4994095
mouse	keyboard
do something with client mouse state and keyboard state information

4994151
margin	height
fix the bottom margin and the content height of your button and have a flexible top margin

maven	pom.xml
i have a maven pom.xml that creates an artifact let s call it everything.jar

4994195
maven	pom.xml
what s the best way to structure my maven pom.xml s to produce two jar files one called mini.jar with just a few classes and the other everything.jar with everything in mini plus some additional classes without actually making copies of the source

4994199
portrait	landscape
i want to change first view in portrait mode and the second view comes in landscape mode i am using the gameconfig.h file

4994199

4994393
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
i knew that given the right circumstances a gridview when connected to a sqldatasource would execute various crud operations directly against the database while applying its own sorting and paging techniques but that didn t translate well to using an objectdatasource with a business object -or so i thought

4994437
typedef	struct
sounds like you need to either use sizeof struct mystruct in your expression or use a typedef struct mystruct mystruct somewhere

4994451
getter	setter
can i generate in eclipse only setter s without getter s of field s

4994457
width	height
if you want the font to remain unscaled but want to resize the textfield use the pixel width and height properties not the percentage width and height of the textfield

4994457
width	height
so in conclusion set the percentages in the transform options to 100 width and 100 height

4994465
for-loop	arrays
after your for-loop if the flag is set add the arrays element

4994473
width	height
applet width 500px height 500px alt test test test code test.class br applet

4994475
getter	setter
go to generate getter and setter and click on select setter

4994530
keydown	keyup
dwell time time between keydown and keyup

4994530
keydown	keyup
in your keydown method save the current time and in the keyup compute the twell time as the difference between the current time and the keydown time

4994530
keydown	keyup
flight time from the figure of the article you linked i can t easily understand how it is defined but i would compute it as the difference between when you left the last key keyup and when you start pressing the next key keydown

4994530
keydown	keyup
so in keyup save a time for instance last_key_time and in keydown compute the flight time as current_time - last_key_time

4994546
filtering	grouping

i write last encountered because at project level we cannot specify a delimiter and what gets used there is the last properties sheet that specified inherited for that macro

5003855

5005191
bitarray	bitset
1 might not yet be sparse enough to make this better compared to just a plain bitarray assuming longs storing 64 bits each it doesn t take more than 2 longs to have more than one bitset on average but if the sparsity increases beyond that the space and time savings will show

int	chars
chars are in practice int as an implementation detail but logically they are not numbers they are chars

5006321
mouseup	mousedown
the system only sends low-level events like mouseup mousedown mousedragged and so on

5006321
mouseup	mousedown
but if iâ want to process the click myself and keep it from going down the rest of the event queue i canâ t simply steal the mouseup event as the previous mousedown was already sent

5006321
mouseup	mousedown
i thought i could delay the mousedown event and only send it later after receiving the corresponding mouseup but that feels wrong i donâ t want to delay all system mousedown events just because of my application

5006347
entities	entitymanager
reference this in your entities when they need to get an entitymanager

5006381

folder	directory
for general use and to prevent problems when moving from one subversion server to another otherwise i would just merge i would like some help putting together a batch file that will recursively go through the directory specified and delete any folder named .svn - i could write some c# but i am very busy at the minute and i can imagine this pretty much being a one liner for you cmd guru s

5006666
folder	directory
in case had a problem with the permissions denied error it s sometimes caused when you try to delete a file that s in a folder higher in the hierarchy to your working directory when trying to delete a path that starts with ..

5006666
folder	directory
so to work around this problem you can use chdir to change the working directory to the folder where the file you want to unlink is located

5006700
std	ostream
something like this would write b s name assuming b has a getname that returns a std string each time you wrote b to the ostream

5006723
greenhopper	sprint
i m guessing you are using greenhopper that does allow you to specify start and end dates for your sprint versions

5006815
rvm	bundler
i recommend that you use rvm and bundler to manage your gems and gem dependencies

5006815
rvm	bundler
it s easy to get rvm + bundler up and started

5006839
nsstring	nsdata
also i modified it to return an nsdata object rather than an nsstring since the decoded string may use a different character encoding than utf-8

5006860
queue	fifo
using push pop gives lifo last in first out behavior stack while using push shift gives fifo behavior queue

5006895
width	height
the inner most query should return 7 records for possibility that even with random you could still get the width and or height image

5006895
width	height
by doing distinct on the id if the first 2 required is the same id as width or height it will immediately be ignored leaving the outer natural result set to 6 records.

5006937
postgresql	mysql
i d like to write a single sql script that will run on a default installation of either mysql or postgresql versions 5.5 and 9.0 respectively

5006967
public	protected
one additional note i found is that if you would like to have any other overloaded constructors make them internal leave the default constructor as protected and have only a single public constructor that contains your dependencies

5006994
ffmpeg	libavformat
by using ffmpeg i mean not using the tool but using libffmpeg libavformat libavcodec from within c++ c eventhough i think you could also do this from the cmdline using the ffmpeg tool by sending your output to stdout and pipe it to md5sum or something equivalent if you re a unix user that is

5007152
postgresql	mysql
is it possible to write a sql script for both mysql and postgresql

5007152
postgresql	mysql
for example if you need to use a bytea in postgresql but a blob in mysql you re going to have a really fun time getting the encoding escaping correct

5007152

next	except
first using the ssl stream examples on here created the client server code next to create the certificates i used this except for the part of registering the network service stuff.

5007207
hash	salt
if you are using different salt then you will want to store both the hash password and the salt in the db

5007209
hash	salt
you should save the salt someplace because you need to use the same salt when computing the hash again

5007222
hash	salt
i ve been wondering how the cryptographymanager is able to compare a salt hash with the plain text

5007222
hash	salt
it has to save the salt for each hash somewhere right

5007257
hash	salt
use always a new salt per hash password and not a constant

5007272
client-side	server-side
so while closing server-side socket does destroy the connection between the two sockets server- and client-side your client-side socket is still bound hence the isbound is returning true

5007274
switching	screens
you can switching versions by clicking a button on the right side of the screens

5007278
post	get
both the form tag and the submit tags have attributes called action and method however the s form s method attribute takes a value of post or get while i think the s sumbit tag s method parameter means the method of the action

5007307
width	height
however when i zoom it looks great because the width height ratio matches the phone s screen

5007314
swt	swing
if you need to do a gui in jython you ll probably need to use a java library like swing or swt

5007317
int	chars
use the method chars chars ch int start int length to store the chars in between the xml tags in a temporary variable

5007320
equals	gethashcode
you ll have to override equals and gethashcode in report

5007321
hash	salt
you can use this class to create the salt hash and combine the two values together

5007341
for-loop	loops
your loops structure is wrong - you are consuming the entirety of the query result set on your first run around the parent for-loop

5007391
hash	salt
i ve been a fan of guids for the salt and sha512 for the hash

5007392
versioning	upgrade
my task is to upgrade to the 1.8 versioning of the ui library

have you checked to make sure the on table users the password column character length is big enough to hold the whole md5 hash

5007660
hash	md5
got an example of the calculated and store md5 hash

5007688
hash	md5
there are numerous questions on stackoverflow that document better approaches and though there are differences of opinion they are all more secure that a regular md5 unsalted hash

5007688
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

5007689
folder	directory
create a js folder in your theme directory

5007738
pull	push
one account works fine but then we are unsure how to really coordinate the entire push pull merge aspect

5007748
post	get
the problem is that it s the wordpress function which is doing the post publish actions so by the time i get to validate data wordpress has already saved the post with a status of publish

5007748
post	get
first off you can t just output data or set a field because the admin page is the result of a redirect and by the time you get to rendering the admin post page again the admin_notices action is already gone

5007790
hide	show
by default the div is hidden and is show on a button click event and hide on a mouseleave event

5007790

in chrome if you hover over the containing text field the mouseout mouseleave event gets triggered and the div hides

5007805
submit	submission
i m working on the data entry piece and have to decide if i should submit the time entered for a given uitextfield as the user has finished entering time or should i do a batch submission after user finished entering time for the entire week

5007807
textmate	notepad++
zen coding works with a multitude of editors and ides such as eclipse and derived notepad++ dreamweaver coda textmate pspad and others some of which are supported officially others are third party implementations

5007835
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
one way is to document that the caller needs to call free on the pointer returned by the function implying that the function will allocate the pointer using malloc or calloc

5007835
free	malloc
this gives the implementation of this api the freedom to allocate the buffers it returns however it sees fit - it s not constrained to use malloc free though it could

5007845
maven	pom.xml
and i then specify my dependencies in my pom.xml using the usual maven xml syntax

5007888
google-chrome	safari
the solution i needed to implement to support iex ff3.x webkit google-chrome safari was to call something like before calling any code that will redraw the rte area

5007907
pop-up	dialog
-now uses the pop-up new item dialog rather than switching to the new item page

5007911

update i have tried looking for the mediaelement using snoop and the actualwidth actualheigt are both 0 but the height property is 140 and the width property is nan

5007937
fast-forward	merge
yes it will probably be a fast-forward merge but it s better safe than sorry

5007940
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy
now the strange behaviour begins just after the last ondestroy finishes another activity is created oncreate onstart onrestoreinstancestate onresume and finally onpause are invoked

5008010
mouse	keyboard
traditionally a display has one keyboard and one mouse though it s more complex these days

5008010
children	parent
windows are arranged in a hierarchical tree where parent windows clip their children child windows can be located entirely or partially outside the extents of the parent but only the part inside the parent is visible

5008010
mouse	keyboard
all screens on a display share the same input devices though mouse and keyboard

5008020
button	checkbox
i have a web page with various checkbox and radio button options that help create a quote

5008020
button	checkbox
however if i print to an actual printer checkbox and radio button aren t shown

5008020
button	checkbox
i ve worked around this by running a function when a checkbox radio button is clicked that outlines the div around the button in black so its not really a problem now

5008025
src	attr
audio attr src ogg_path

5008025
src	attr
what about attr src mp3_path along with ogg_path

5008025
src	attr
but in audio attr src is an only src not array alas as far as i can see

5008048
inherited	properties
this is different from publishinglayoutpage which inherited eventually to page which has the zones properties

5008067
memcpy	strncpy
second use memcpy or strncpy to copy the bytes of string into

5008080
macbook	bootcamp
i tried several multitouch pads working on windows such as msi starpad and macbook pro built-in touchpad booted in window 7 using bootcamp but none of them generate windows multitouch or gesture event

5008089
post	get
i believe this can be done using http response headers from php but i understand the post request will become a get request

5008102
subtract	add
i know i can do simple math add subtract divide mulitply etc but i havnt found anything searching forums google etc that tells me how to add a log function

5008106
post	get
unless the redirecting script takes steps to push the post data into the get s url or into a cookie the data s dead and gone

5008106
post	get
most browsers limit the length of a url and post have effectively no limit to the size of the data being posted so you wouldn t want that 500megabyte file you just uploaded appended to the get url s query line

5008197
pascal	delphi
one of the philosophical changes that occurred in the evolution of turbo pascal into delphi was the acknowledgment that delphi lives in a c-dominated world and there was more to be gained by gracefully accepting or tolerating c-isms than ignoring them and forcing the delphi developer to sort it out

5008220
opera	firefox
both opera and firefox 4 draw their menu button on the top-left corner

5008259
vb.net	vb6
i am trying to get the following vb6 listindex to work within my vb.net code

5008259
vb.net	vb6
this is what vb.net did with the converting of the vb6 to .net code

5008280
width	height
you could give each li div a width and a height then use the css background to apply the image positioned with background-position and then use this for rounded corners

5008290
google-chrome	firefox
this behaviour is the same for google-chrome firefox and ie

5008314
children	parent
i need to return li 5 and 11 as these are the last children within their parent ul that dont have .x

5008353
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
besides serving up an image dynamically from your webapp it s also possible to use a webapp to dynamically authorize access to static resources that the webserver will serve -- commonly by putting the files somewhere that the webserver has access to but not mapped to any public uri and then using something like x-sendfile lighttpd apache with mod_sendfile others x-accel-redirect nginx x-reproxy-file perlbal etc

5008363
google-chrome	safari
the problem is only in google-chrome and safari

5008364
folder	directory
folder is in the root directory

5008394
int	chars
i need to know how to cast int to chars and then how to append one chars to another

5008410
free	malloc
if you re doing it to try and catch programming mistakes you want to make sure you don t accidentally mix up my_malloc my_free and malloc free then just pick a random value

5008410
free	malloc
if you re actually implementing malloc free writing your own c library then keep in mind that free ing something that wasn t malloc ed except null is undefined behavior by the standard so your code doesn t need to worry what happens

5008418
typedef	typename
you forgot typename in typedef

5008438
wamp	ampps
there are some other packages like wamp such as xampp and ampps

5008441
int	chars
if you want to convert a int to a chars just do the following -

5008441
int	chars
note that since chars are smaller in size than int this casting may cause a loss of data

5008449
int	double
i do a first guess getmass return an int or int and not a float or double

5008449
int	double
if you have a math operation + - the resulting type will be int if none of the both operants is a floating point data structure double or float

5008451
serializable	deserialization
if you re using a robust json serializable like json.net you can even skip the intermediate deserialization and change your dataholder type to the correct type

5008457
int	chars
casting int to chars is done simply by assigning with the type in parenthesis

5008463
int	chars
casting int to chars involves losing data and the compiler will probably warn you

5008476
textview	imageview
i have an android spinner item in which the lines are made up of a textview and an imageview a star to mark that the user has marked that particular item as a favourite

5008485
width	height
the map is just a hand drawn image as the background of a fixed width and height div

5008511
children	parent
put another way i need to be able to display each treecomposite that is its own parent as a single row and what that row looks like depends on whether the treecomposite has children

5008521
postgresql	mysql
postgresql will ignore it mysql will run it

5008521
postgresql	mysql
update if you want to include commands that are run only on postgresql but not on mysql you can exploit the fact that postgresql supports nested comments and mysql doesn t

5008528
versioning	upgrade
i also added a major upgrade item that upgrade on a product versioning from 0.0.0.0 to 3.0.0.0 so it should upgrade all the programs

5008616
unsigned	short
if this is the case what would i need to do so that wchar_t is defined as an unsigned short

5008616
unsigned	short
getstringutfchars returns const char and getstringchars returns const jchar with jchar being defined as an unsigned short 2 bytes

5008616
unsigned	short
defining wchar_t as an unsigned short would make it compatible with getstringchars and seemingly make my life much easier

5008639
ddms	adb
use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to examine logcat and look at the stack trace associated with your exception

5008649
mef	prism
prism using any ioc container mef unity ninject autofac etc

5008649
mef	prism

5008700
rss	feed
i am creating an iphone app that will contain multiple rss feed

5008701
hash	md5
for cryptographic hash functions look at jca which allows generating sha-1 md5 and other cryptographic digests which all have the effect you re looking for

5008708
put	get
on server run which whenever or whereis whenever you should get full path to the command put it into script

5008747
client-side	server-side
it runs server-side rather than client-side like the yui3 widgets library and chances are if you don t need to roll your own high-performance evented sockets asynchronous http etc

5008785
multiplying	subtract
when it happens that probably wouldn t cause a major change but if for example you later subtract off a fixed amount from each and multiplying what s left the difference would be multiplied as well

5008803
hide	show
i d have them on the page from the beginning and then just show hide them using the filter docs method with this.id and the toggle docs method with this.checked while placing the most recently clicked one at the bottom of the list using the appendto docs method

raphaã l is a cross platform javascript library for outputting vector graphics in both standards compliant svg for firefox google-chrome internet explorer 9+ ... and vml for older versions of internet explorer

5008826
client-side	server-side
the closest thing i found was provider statistics for sql server ado.net on msdn but those stats seem to be client-side stats about network connectivity bytes sent received from the client s perspective not the server-side statistics i m looking for

5008829
min	max
i have a table a sql server 2008 that contains sets of min and max numbers

5008829
min	max
in one of my stored procedures i use this table joined with a product table b to find an available product number that s between min and max and then insert a new product with this product number

5008829
min	max
so i want the next free number that s between min max

5008829
min	max
edit the min max table is a table for different product series

5008859
keystore	jks
is there is any that i can convert ava jks keystore to pkcs12 certificate programatically

5008863
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari i can see the animated looping progess bar background style and loading...

5008882
implements	extends
when the l f changes to a l f that you support silently switch out their class name with your subclasses class name and then implements componentuis for your custom components and extends the parent lookandfeel.createui method so that it knows about your new components

5009049
boost	allocator
you can then pool your agents using a fixed-size object allocator such as boost pool and pass them around by pointer or shared_ptr

5009096
filesystems	hfs+
update 2 the filesystems is journaled hfs+ filesystems on the mac and is not case-sensitive

5009101
opera	firefox
this works in webkit and firefox not in ie or opera

5009105
ubuntu	linux
however it seems ubuntu 10.04 doesn t support 4.7- only ubuntu 10.10 does and the user does not want to upgrade his linux distribution as his is long term support

5009111
antlr	irony
i ve looked at antlr and irony but they are more tools than methodologies

5009113
post	get
trying to use libcurlpp a c++ wrapper to libcurl to post a form and get the response

5009133
google-chrome	firefox
i tried firefox and google-chrome and it doesn t work in both

5009185
vb.net	vb6
the vb.net list box does not have the concept of itemdata thus a direct conversion of the vb6 code is not possible

5009214
stateless	stateful
web applications are generally stateless views into stateful systems and use a request response architecture whereas desktop applications are stateful and usually event-driven

5009216
addition	multiplication
i find it really useful for time calculations but most other conversions are just simple multiplication addition combinations

5009245
centos	linux
please remember i have little to no experience working with centos and linux .

5009250
firefox	safari
best thing to do it use the developer menu in safari preferences advanced or firebug with firefox to see what js is loading and if there are js errors

5009262
post	get
i can get this to work if i have the server use _get and just add the extra data in the url string but i want to use post

5009262
post	get
heres the function notice the url string where i m trying to get the variables api_key session_key and method to be sent in the post request

5009270
width	height
how can you scale an image - whether it be using bitmap or encodedimage to fill the entire width and height of a field

5009301
firefox	safari
and the solution to the trick is just to more closely duplicate what a regular web browser does thus comparing your headers sent to the headers sent by firebug in firefox or the inspector in safari can help a lot

5009319
int	double
3.2 isn t an int value but a double

5009336
viewdidload	viewwillappear
how do i reload a uiview after viewdidload + viewwillappear have already been called and the view displayed

5009339
post	get
as your post begins to explain you could accomplish this yourself with your own c++ code but sqlite solves the problem very well and you get many advantages out of the box sorting aggregating etc

5009353
jquery	livevalidation
livevalidation + jquery ui tabs

5009355

google-chrome	firefox
i know there s a couple of tab grouping organization extensions for firefox and google-chrome but i ve tried most of them and haven t found them all that helpful

5010019

linux i believe has had better java support than freebsd

5010119

both systems have large suites of available software packages available freebsd is likely larger and there s a better chance something may have been ported to freebsd over solaris depending on the niche of the package of course

5010119
freebsd	solaris
solaris i believe has a bit higher base resource requirements than freebsd if that matters most likely not

5010119

so in my priority list mac solaris linux bsd unless bsd s java support has gotten completely hassle free and functional with no oh you re using bsd isms

would it be fair to say one would normalised a float where there is a max and minimum

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
code leaves a gap between the end of #main and the end of the actual page on ie google-chrome and safari but not on firefox

int	chars
so your code could probably do chars comparisons up to an int alignment area then int comparisons then chars comparisons again but again the alignments of both areas will probably matter

5017721
google-chrome	firefox
this works for me in firefox google-chrome and ie8

5017733
post	get
i want to send the data to the next page using get not post

5017773
int	chars
if you compare as int you will need to check alignment and check if count is divisible by sizeof int to compare the last bytes as chars

5017784
implements	extends
often times i will extends an asynctask that implements audiorecord to read the audio buffer and push the buffer back to the ui thread for visualization if needed

5017785
loops	if-statement
i ve always heard that if-statement in loops are slow

5017790
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
it works in ie opera firefox and safari

5017793
apache	nginx
it is useful to run nginx in front of apache anyway because apache handles slow clients badly

5017801

affinity	processors
check affinity masks for processors

5017883
int	chars
unsigned chars - unsigned chars signed int

5017883
int	chars
int at a time only works if the pointers are aligned or if you can read a few bytes from the front of each and they are both still aligned so if both are 1 before the alignment boundary you can read one chars of each then go int-at-a-time but if they are aligned differently eg one is aligned and one is not there is no way to do this

5017925
hide	show
give them all another class for example item and then make the click hide all item and show all of the selected value

this is not a port but it looks like you are sending a post and then obtaining the authorization token and then sending a get request using this

5018067
udp	tcp
it should be like this another program is sending a tcp udp packet - my program is calling a function triggered then.

5018068
int	boolean
if you re looking at specific combinations of states i think gorillapatch s suggestion is right you would turn those four boolean into a single 4-bit int and compare it against bit masks representing the various combinations you re interested in

5018080
webkit	gecko
if you really want to do it yourself from scratch your best bet would be to look at the source for gecko webkit and or chromium and re-use whatever you can from there assuming your app s source license makes that possible

multiplying	add
add them all together divide by 100 and multiplying by 25

5018257
int	double
the decimal type is represented in what amounts to base-10 using a struct containing int i believe as opposed to double and other floating-point types which represent non-integral values in base-2

5018289
rtsp	sdp
in the sdp a control track1 and a control track2 whereas in the rtsp setup request you are using trackid 1

5018315

5018460
swt	styledtext
having read this bug report i grepped the whole swt source tree for the wordwrap keyword and it looks like steve northover boys have worked around the bug much better with the styledtext control than with the label control

hi i have problem with url rewrite on my site..my situation is that the site is fully ajax loaded and i am changing hash in url to navigate within the site..when someone put the hashed url into his browser it would load correctly..with this i had first problem with links for example on facebook and to with copied links on the site..these links are only sef urls produced by joomla so i when people comes to the site for example from facebook with this link i have to parse it and change to the hashed on..simply it has to be consistent..it all is fully working but today i got another problem with links in newsletter sent from joomla..these ones arent parsed by jrouter so i have another problem with parsing these ones into hashed form..it is getting to be pretty much complicated si i am asking if someone here know some best practices to get the kind of behaviour to work

5018659
sorting	filtering
to have advantages of server side data filtering paging and sorting jqgrid work better with the data which included additional information about the current page see here

5018659
sorting	filtering
if you can not change the server side which produce the json data you can add loadonce true parameter and then the filtering paging and sorting of data will be done locally

5018717
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 produce hash codes which are longer than 64 bits md5 - 128 bits sha1 - 160 bit

5018723
for-loop	arrays
for instance i could use a number of threads such that each thread goes through parts of the for-loop but works on different parts of the arrays

5018724

i am developing a rss news feed app for android and using toast.maketext to show the news or current update

5018727
int	chars
example source 123-45-6789 int - destination 6789 chars 4

5018736
inherited	subclassing
on the other hand if you do write an intermediary abstract-class you solved that problem but now your subclassing may not be a subclassing of another class because of absence of multiple inherited in java

5018751
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
you have a simple foreignkey relationship which should work for you just don t confuse it with inherited where you would set up a guest to inherited the properties of contact through subclassing

5018752
serializable	deserialization
for serializable and deserialization

5018786

one advantage of jqgrid is using a server-side library that automatically interacts with the client-side jqgrid

5018890
children	parent
i m trying to avoid duplicate blocks of code--each dealing with different children of a parent

5018898
post	get
if you need a get instead of a post you should also set the #method

5018925
serializable	deserialization
emf generates classes to represent instances of the model in-memory with support for xml or xmi serializable deserialization hooks for validation an optional editor and more

5018978
aggregate-functions	sum
the thing i find important is realizing that you can group by multiple columns and still apply aggregate-functions like sum max or count using the following syntax

5019004
ssl	https
all transport is over https ssl

5019042
google-chrome	firefox
this example shows that with a 30px text size the line height in ie7 and ie8 are not on par with google-chrome and firefox

5019108
jobs	cron
i just schedule cron jobs that run php scripts

5019111
folder	directory
this will check the current folder for tags file and keep going one directory up all the way to the root folder

5019113
jobs	cron
on unix machines you use cron which is for re-occuring jobs

5019132
set	bag
use an iset instead of an ilist and map it as a set offcourse instead as a bag

5019133
subclass	abstract-class
a reference to an abstract-class is just like a pointer to an abstract-class it needs to reference an object of some non-abstract subclass of the abstract-class

5019144
vmware	virtualbox
sometimes this is because they have some virtual adapters from applications like virtualbox or vmware or because they have more than one physical network adapter connected to their computer

5019155
min	max
rather than introspecting the model field i just put min and max values in a variable at the top for simplicity

5019157
innodb	myisam
i currently have myisam and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than innodb in my case but i heard that innodb has acid transactions

5019165
.htaccess	httpd.conf
there s also the main server httpd.conf files which are a preferred location for long-standing .htaccess directives as that s read only once at server startup and not per-request as .htaccess files are

5019433
rss	feed
if the volume of news is very low you could use notifications as sugested but as i assume an rss feed may have a lot of things to notificate it would flood the notification list if you want to display them one by one

5019506
hash	hmac
i would suggest looking into using an approach like hmac hash message authentication code for your security or a similar token-based approach

5019511
radgridview	xamdatagrid
no i m not quite sure what you are after but you could provide normal form controls to add an additional item to the list outside the markup of the listview or use a third party grid which provides in place editing such as the telerik radgridview or the infragistics xamdatagrid

5019530
stdout	fflush
perlvar states if set to nonzero forces a fflush right away and after every write or print on the currently selected output channel. the code in this example should turn on autoflush causing a fflush then add noting to the stdout buffer and cause a fflush

5019532
maven	pom.xml
but you have to tell maven to include non java stuff which is in src main java by adding something like this to your pom.xml file

5019549
rss	feed
could you rig up an rss feed and use a feed reader to notify you

5019561
button	checkbox
is there a way to add a checkbox or radio button on a page to toggle form fields between input type text and password

5019636
hide	show
but with jquery you could override the hide show functions so that they fire custom events onshow and onhide then you could bind event handlers to these events to run various code when those events fire

5019638
jar	.war
you ll probably need to get most or all of the axis 1.4 jar files into your web app s .war file

5019651
public	protected
by default the asdoc tool generates output for all public and protected elements in an actionscript class even if you omit the asdoc comment

5019651
public	protected
it explicitly says for all public and protected elements which makes sense for api documentation private members are not accessible from outside the class and therefore remain hidden

5019666
firefox	safari
but the problem with this it works perfectly in safari firefox etc but does not work in internet explorer 8 and probably not for 6 7

5019788
hash	md5
sqlite doesn t have md5 built in so i m considering using the hash function instead

5019788
hash	md5
i don t know much about hashing but i can see that hash output is numerical and of varying length while md5 returns mixed characteds numbers of a fixed length

5019788
hash	salt
can hash with salt be used to safely store passwords

5019859
width	height
saving features to a file means save the number of contours in the image x y width and height of each contour right

5019887

5019917
oncreate	onstart
re-entering the app in this case calls the classics oncreate onstart onresume

5019919
disk	ram
the only way i can think of is to create a ram disk and then point the system property java.io.tmpdir to that ram disk

5019922
rss	feed
zend_feed i m not completely sure how to make an rss feed properly set the content type etc.

5019951
google-chrome	firefox
i figured out that only works in google-chrome and only works in firefox

5019951
google-chrome	firefox
so is there a way without needing to download a jquery plugin for me to scroll to a specific element in both google-chrome and firefox i don t care about ie and have a callback executed once

5019967
width	height
but what happens when you do set a specific height or width on a box and the content inside cannot fit

5019977
dictionary	map
is it possible with automapper in c# to map the properties of an object to an array dictionary

5019981
hash	salt
with the php hash function you can pass sha256 to the first parameter and it will create a strong hash of the password + salt

5019981
hash	salt
putting the salt at the beginning is better than putting it at the end as more randomness at the beginning of hash is better than randomness at the end

5019982
children	parent
have the children processes wait for an exclusive grab of the shared memory segment via a parent process created mutex

5019982
children	parent
create a per-process pipe between the parent an children processes

5019990
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
use bufferedinputstream fileoutputstream and bufferedoutputstream

5020031
fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter
if all that you want to do is reduce the number of system calls to write to the disk you can wrap the fileoutputstream in a bufferedoutputstream with appropriately big buffer size and write to this bufferedoutputstream or bufferedwriter instead of writing directly to the original fileoutputstream

5020059
gif	bmp
the user can drag any image jpg bmp gif on a picturebox

5020079
d3.js	protovis
protovis succeeded by d3.js

5020117
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
aggregate-functions are functions such as sum avg min max etc

5020119
hash	md5
i would stay away from sha1 and md5 as they both have vulnerabilities or known reverse-lookup tables ie if someone got the hash password they could go to many sites available online and enter that in and it will give them a password that will when passed through md5 or sha1 give the same password.

5020123
width	margin
if any of your floating div s have padding border or margin styles the floating width will be off since you re doing width

5020169
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for google-chrome and firefox

5020190
post	get
i need to implement a servlet that uploads files to a server i realize everyone says it has to be a post method in regard to uploading files and not with get method

5020191
min	max
columns in the select with the exception of some dbms like mysql have to be either an aggregate sum avg min max or a column in the group by clause

5020222
put	get
i need to put the list i get from a json api also possible with xml into a listpreference

5020258
post	get
you can process the post data as you are doing now plus you can get the get parameters also

5020306
accessor	properties
no there is no way to convert a collection of elements into an array without looping or special accessor methods for the type - let alone convert a common properties from a collection of elements into an array

5020317
range	minimum
i would like to pass in a starting ip address and an ending ip address and have the java spit out the minimum list of cidr blocks required to cover only the range passed in and nothing more

5020417
hash	md5
they are the same for the most part because both bin2hex and base64_encode encode the sequence of bytes and do not generate a hash like sha1 or md5

5020458
maven	m2e
i m using maven in eclipse m2e and i have a multi-module project which i used checkout as a maven project to bring it to my workspace

5020458
children	parent
the structure seems to be flat in eclipse and it has duplicate of children parent is there with all the children nested in it as folders doesn t show the packages inside children as a package should look like but has them as nested ordinary folders also all the children show up as independent projects beside the parent under the children projects the packages are shown as they should the package icon is shown and it is dot notation

5020458
children	parent
i have changed a lot of files in children s projects but the changes don t show in the parent s project and i cannot commit them all in one commit i will have to commit each child one by one which adds a lot of commits and increases the version number unnecessarily

5020472
portrait	landscape
2.how to decrease the space gap in both portrait landscape between the handle and its content container

5020488
translation	localization
the localization files provide localisations translation of messages

5020491
implements	extends
the only downside with passing a string name of a class is that you can t be sure that it implements an specific interface or extends some other object

5020522
put	get
for instance if i put in robert randolph for the artist and colorblind for the title i get robert randolph and the family band s colorblind album

5020538
stdout	stderr
my assumption was that the output was being written to stdout but the exception pulls its output from stderr

5020538
stdout	stderr
i ve tried to re implement the functionality of check_output but i still get nothing on the output when i believe i should be seeing output to stdout and stderr

5020547
daemon	cron
the daemon will be triggered at the specified time intervals via a plesk cron job

5020621
onmouseover	onclick
you really shouldn t be using onmouseover or onclick

5020637
ssl	https
conf server.xml - https protocol included to use ssl and port 8003

5020652
post	get	post	put	put	get
http standard doesn t restrict range requests to only get method - one can use them with post or put as well

5020659
width	height
one way might be to specify the height and width of an html embed tag

5020661
websphere	ibm
first i don t think ibm introduced jython until websphere version 5.1

5020675
implements	extends
so now only extends to 32 bit instead of 8 and implements in java and you are ready

5020686
google-chrome	firefox
no and there won t be any time soon because google-chrome s add-on api is more restrictive than firefox

5020694
post	get
you will get as post or get those checkbox values which are checked

5020699
opera	google-chrome
however opera and google-chrome although receiving the same object print out the object in an incorrect order it seems like they both perform a sort by id number instead of just leaving it alone

5020699
opera	google-chrome
however i d still like to understand why opera and google-chrome feel it is their right to change the order of my objects ids

5020727
ant	maven
you can select not to fetch from an scm specify which ant build file to run from which script to run or which directory to run maven from - anywhere on your file system

5020739
pull	push
they pull types using the service locator instance must be coupled to it whereas dependency injection containers push the vast majority of the application is di agnostic so the code is far less brittle and more re-usable

5020747
ccl	clisp
i am using clisp and ccl

5020750
google-chrome	firefox
also i ve only tested in firefox because you suggested using firebug where your site seems to work - in google-chrome there are no images

5020757
min	max
this will find the min max of id

5020792
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome and firefox stealing away audiences from ie to fast i forecast that its only a matter of time that before such questions will be obsolete.

5020811
i2c	spi
while it is possible for a processor to control any number of inputs and outputs using a four-wire spi bus or even a two-wire i2c bus in many cases the number of signals a processor will need to monitor or control is sufficiently small that it s easier to simply include the circuitry to monitor or control some signals directly on the chip itself

5020812
hide	show
the navigation bar that the users will use to change screens will exist outside of the screen but when a user clicks it what common ways have people been using to hide one and show another

5020837

5020843
d3.js	protovis
update the protovis team has moved to another library called d3.js data driven documents as they said

5020843
d3.js	protovis
the protovis team is now developing a new visualization library d3.js with improved support for animation and interaction

5020843
d3.js	protovis
d3.js builds on many of the concepts in protovis

5020868
awt	swing
i m not a swing expert i can only base my knowledge on awt but doesn t the paintcomponent function get called quite often

5020871
apk	dex
the dex file in apk is executed by the dalvik vm but when the logic in opcodes calls a method in a library not in dex format does the vm suspend and wait for the process that this app vm is running on to execute the library

5020874
vsto	add-in
assuming your app is not a vsto add-in look for a folder with the first four letters of your assembly name and then tion not exe

5020891
google-chrome	firefox
it s working just fine on google-chrome and firefox 6

5020924
hash	md5
the only way i can think to implement this would be to md5 all the variables that the generated php was given and then check against a list of html files as to whether the variables have the same hash however i imagine this would be very cpu intensive and a complete waste of time

5020927
int	chars
a is initialized to a cast to int and truncated because chars is 3 or 7 bytes too small pointer that points to a chars array propably somewhere in rom

5020941

in c it meant a call to alloc malloc without a corresponding free

5020954
min	max
i was looking for a way to add max min functions to javascript s array class which seemed to be a solved problem javascript min max array values

if you re wanting to just overlay text on top of an image just wrap the imageview in a framelayout and then just define a textview after the imageview

5020986
put	get
when i recreate the sproc it does not get put in the system folder and gets put in the general sproc folder of msdb

5021004
post	get	post	put	put	get
once you do something like this you can use get and it would be a read-only resource since you can t post or put to it - it gets updated when it s get ed

5021041
getter	setter
generally i prefer the semantics of object attribute access over dict get set access but there are some circumstances where dict-like access is required for example and i d prefer not to have special getter setter methods for these cases so thus the dual behavior of dict object at the same time with shared attributes

5021069
put	get
i tried to put in the where before the group as tim fultz sugested but i get the error

5021078
children	parent

client-side	server-side
the javascript parser is used both client-side and server-side to guarantee consistent markup special thanks to the jurassic javascript compiler

5022089
interpolation	splines
worse for 3000 points an interpolation splines will give you roughly that many cubic segments

5022089
interpolation	splines
if all that you need is a tool that can provide an exact interpolation at any point and you really don t need to have an explicit formula then an interpolation splines is a good choice

5022103
ssl	https
then in iis have it use an ssl certificate and https

5022239
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
btw it would also be wise to move all your static content css javascript images etc.. to a separate multithreaded web server nginx lighttpd etc.. so the simultaneous user accesses do not make your apache fork to much processes

public	protected
example from here two or more public protected protected internal members defined with only case difference

if thay are increase the width or height of the container div

5022463
post	get
when you post data to the server in php does it get transmitted through the headers

5022476
folder	directory
personally i d recommend creating your uploads folder outside of your web app s directory so that it is not replaced during deployment etc

5022493
put	get
final question now everything works except that it seems that when i put my variable instance in the queue then it does not get updated and everytime i get it from the queue it does not contain the observation i added in the previous iteration

5022506
inherited	subclassing
i am trying to build some classes that inherited from a parent class which contains subclassing that inherited from other parent classes

5022525
getter	setter
its not necessary to lock synchronize getter and setter of primitive types - tagging them as volatile is sufficient in most cases apart from double and long as you mention

5022528
post	get
great article better article explaining post get

5022528
post	get
post includes name value pairs in the body of the request while get does so in the query string

5022584
folder	directory
you should copy one of those directory to just plain django in the specified folder to get it to work with the current pydev

5022613
move	drag
when i drag an item the adorner appears and follows the cursor around while the cursor is over the listbox but if i try to move the cursor away from the listbox the adorner seems to almost go under the other controls zindex

5022619
hide	show
the expand collapse of the div works without a problem using hide show methods

5022648

i showed it to the client and they say that i can t have the data seen in view source and i can t pass this data via get even though anyone with a sniffer can grab the post contents

5022704
width	height
the bottom div should fill the rest of the page width 100 height 100 and also show scrollbar if needed

5022738
vb.net	vb6
vb.net is a language that is derived from the earlier language vb6

5022752
int	double
then you can call this with any built-in type int short double float etc and it will instantiate the function add at compile time according to the type you use

5022764
int	double
it does get a bit more complex when the two might not match so for example you could add an int to a double and get a double result

5022764
decltype	auto
with c++0x you can look into auto and decltype for such tasks

5022778
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and google-chrome is unaffected but ie still makes a mess

5022826
createelement	domdocument
i m using php s domdocument library for certain xml stuff createelement appendchild etc

5022835

i m running this on a 64bit machine and my target platform is set to x86

5022869

so really your question is likely is there anyway to generate setter getter methods at runtime

5022899
gif	png
in general gzipping gif png or jpeg images will not yield gains over a couple percent in fact the compressed file may be larger than the original

5022908

i ve been working with dnn for years well since versioning 3 and there is no great conspiracy to force ce users to upgrade to pro

5022947
innodb	myisam
also does this answer change depending on whether i am using innodb or myisam

5022947
innodb	myisam
the table concerned is myisam but most of our tables are innodb

5022967
put	get
but both the get and put could fail if the size of the arraylist is the index

5023012
vbo	normals
you don t need to use vbos glvertexattribpointer takes a normals cpu-pointer if no vbo is bound you can call glbindbuffer gl_array_buffer 0 to make sure

5023017
min	max
my current version for get min or max value is

5023116
portrait	landscape
however when i try to use it i just get the method getrotation is undefined for the type display and eclipse tells me to change it to the deprecated function getorientation which will not work for what i need because it only returns landscape portrait not 0 90 180 270

5023145
g++	gcc
does gcc g++ screw up with protected data members in templates

5023164
richfaces	tomahawk
t is for tomahawk and a4j is a richfaces prefix

5023183
strdup	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strdup
you need to stick something like into the lex.l action to ensure it points at valid memory or just use the simpler and equivalent call to strdup as that combines the malloc and strcpy

5023209
int	chars
this casts the filenames to an int which effectively changes anything that starts with an int followed by any chars to just the int

5023322
int	double
when dividing an int by an int you won t get a double as result

5023324
post	get
if not what do i need to do to see the request object post and get vars in ie

5023327
int	boolean
your example looks like you want to have a map from pairs of int to boolean with the default value being false

5023367
int	double	division	multiplication
you can either calculate the expression as a double or do the multiplication first so that you don t lose relevant precision from the int division

5023370

how to autorotate from portrait to landscape mode

5023512
superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
if i have a class hierarchy in which subclassing require use of more specific types than those specified in the superclass ivars is it better to declare the superclass ivar as id or to type it and then cast where necessary in the subclassing

5023512
ivar	subclassing
i m assuming here that the subclassing has appropriately assigned a subthing to the ivar

5023512
superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
however i like the fact in the typed version that the superclass in effect documents what subclassing should do with the ivar

5023513
post	get
if i render the hidden input field for id when adding a post i get an error stating that the id can t be null

5023674
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome firefox but in internet explorer it gives an error in the jquery file

5023677
base-class	derived-class
in vb.net one can do things a little better since vb.net supports exception filtering and since vb.net runs field initializers after the base-class constructor and thus allows base-class members to be used within the derived-class field initializers

5023695
portrait	landscape
the problem is that when i add the tabbar to the rootview the app does not rotate to landscape if i change the orientation the view remains in portrait mode

5023718

5023718

jax-ws	jax-rs
jaxb is the default binding layer for both jax-rs restful web services and jax-ws soap web services

5023748
jax-ws	jax-rs
jaxb was designed in conjunction with jax-ws and jax-rs was written to leverage jaxb

5023764
for-loop	loops
so in ff your for-loop loops 6 times but it only loops once in ie and fails on the if statement

5023770

5023927
hash	md5
base64 encode a md5 hash

5023988
hide	show
i think you re getting a bit confused to be honest with you to do this in css would be much harder would involve using a div to hide show with the options to exit or stay

5023994
width	height
without javascript i think about just float left all the element but i do need to control the size of the picture to be 2 times or 4 times height or width to each other

5024002
rss	feed
i want to use cooliris www.cooliris.com in my asp.net website and it should take images from my website images folder not from external sources like facebook flickr youtube or external rss feed

5024045

to get around this you need to explicitly put thing in the window s adorner and not that of the listbox or listboxitem

5024109
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the solution i found for all of the browsers that i tested ie firefox google-chrome safari opera is that the first input element on the form has to be visible and has to be the first element in the form

5024111
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari if i assign the same src as the one before the handler function is not run

5024117
pop-up	dialog
b how do i get the file save dialog to pop-up for this on-the-fly file

5024124
width	height
have the function recurse upward through itself and parents and print out width height scalex and scaley

5024124
width	height
my suspicion is that you are artificially setting width and or height on something before the image is loaded and scalex and scaley are ending up with bad values

5024138
firefox	safari	versioning	upgrade
we recently upgrade our server to php 5 and file uploads are now failing but only from os x clients safari 5 firefox 3.6 although the same browser versioning on windows work fine

5024143
google-chrome	firefox
gradients stay fixed in firefox and google-chrome and scroll with the page

5024166
coalesce	isnull
sql server is probably smart enough to translate isnull into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then coalesce is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with isnull and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in isnull

5024195
getter	setter
where item is a public static class item with constructors and all the fields above with getter and setter

5024245
temp	tmp
in that case perhaps just write the files to a temporary directory tmp on unix machines and c windows temp on windows machines

5024253

but the exact same code will allow zooming on galaxy tablet

5024351
width	height
you can resize the player by editing the object width 425 and height 350 fields at both the beginning and end of the embedded player code

5024351
width	height
make sure that the sizes you choose have the same ratio as the default numbers so that the video doesn t get stretchedâ just multiply the width by 0.8235 to get the height

5024354
pop-up	dialog
here are a few snippets from the kobo app s pop-up dialog code on the ipad uialertview looks kinda dinky on ipad so richard penner wrote a better one

this is the typical cpu model 4 opteron processors each has dual core

5024371
width	height
when inserting an image you can provide width and height of the image which results in html like follows

5024371

the next problem is then when editing an image the width and height naturally are in the url field and are missing in the dedicated fields for width and height

5024411
super	self
wild guess call self cleanup first then call super

5029474
integer	fractions
i d recommend using one integer value instead of separate whole and fractions part

5029474

datamapper	activerecord
doctrine uses the datamapper pattern while propel uses the activerecord pattern

5032892

have a look at delegation and multicastdelegate both msdn links for more information on how this works

5033547
children	parent
i must be missing something trivial with sqlalchemy s cascade options because i cannot get a simple cascade delete to operate correctly -- if a parent element is a deleted the children persist with null foreign keys

5033547
children	parent
the script creates a parent adds 3 children then commits

5033547

cpython	pypy
since the programs are compiled one could simply contribute modules written in rpython and it could compete with other python implementations including cpython and pypy

5034033
post	get
when applied to an action it restricts the action to only requests made with that particular http verb get or post

5034070
children	parent
you might want to add delete-orphan as well delete causes children to be deleted when the parent gets deleted delete-orphan also deletes any children that were removed from the parent even if the parent is not deleted

5034217
cpython	pypy
that s necessary for implementing pypy but generally if you want fast compiled code that can interact with python you d use cpython which is targeted at cpython extensions and supports pretty much all of python seamlessly or write code in one of the more common languages that can do this

so i put validation into the property s get as well

5034430
getter	setter
as alxx mentioned in his comment you can change the property accountstate in your component from an actual property to a setter getter

5034440
super	self
notice that at the time you define b.__init__ you might think that super b self .__init__ is the same as calling a.__init__ self but you d be wrong

5034440
super	self
in the above situation super b self .__init__ actually calls c.__init__ self

5034440
super	self
holy smokes b knows nothing about c and yet super b self knows to call c s __init__

5034454
ssl	https
i m providing a file download usually csv or pdf in my jsf web application on a https ssl host

5034461
superclass	subclassing
if you keep it around even as a private field you can t count on somebody else not having a reference to it and mutating it. if you need your subclassing to interoperate with apis that require the superclass then include an asxxx method that generates the superclass object on the fly

5034483
accessor	properties
so why does it need to know the static type for a properties accessor

5034483
accessor	properties	getter	setter
because a properties can designate any method to be the getter or the setter not just the default pair of foo and setfoo so the compiler needs to know what properties this is in order to generate the correct accessor calls

5034525
telerik	radcombobox
i have a silverlight telerik radcombobox

uitouch	uibutton
i am trying to make it so that my ipad app records with nslog the coordinates of the uitouch that occurs whenever they press one of my app s uibutton

5034967
hash	md5
in the database you overwrite the old md5 hash with the new md5 hash

5034972
width	height
so create a new hidden div set a fixed width of 600 but not height then loop through

5034972
width	height
set a width 600 and leave the height

5035003

children	parent
what we ve done here is created an alias to the same table for child and parent then find the children that fit between the given parent node

5035343
client-side	server-side
otherwise you ll need your server-side project to be dependent on your client-side project since any data objects that are shared will need to be part of the client so gwt can create a javascript version of them

5035374
vmware	esx
vmware s desktop software runs on microsoft windows linux and mac os x while vmware s enterprise software hypervisors for servers vmware esx and vmware esxi are bare-metal embedded hypervisors that run directly on server hardware without requiring an additional underlying operating system

so currently i have code in c++ that creates a few qlabel a qlineedit and a qcheckbox when a selection is made from a qcombobox

5035428
free	malloc
unfortunately this would require allocating memory for the array and using manual memory management malloc free which depending on the lifecycle of the array can be anywhere from a nuisance to awful

5035446

so of course the easiest solution is to get a list of folder in the directory and build the paths to the auto load files if the files exist then the script includes them

5035466
jax-ws	jax-rs
is there a framework library or technique that combines jax-rs and jax-ws or equivalent functionality into one combined service in a similar way to using two endpoints one soap and one rest for the same service in wcf

i understand that doing this with inherited is not good because of the bulk of subclassing and those subclassing would not override anything just add new properties which really isnt that good in my opinon

5035656
lapack	gsl
specifically use the industry-standard lapack library or use the gsl or whatever other linear algebra library you want

5035691
getter	setter
i see absolutely no reason to use maps for future proofing the argument that you can avoid having to add new methods is laughable especially when you consider that adding a new field takes about 20 keystrokes adding getter and setter for it another 3-4 mouse clicks

5035698
force.com	salesforce
soql the saleforce object query language is a sql like syntax used on the force.com platform to query records within a salesforce instance

i needed the height and width of the scaled bitmap before it s ever drawn to the screen so that i could draw some overlays in the correct position

5035943
width	height
i got the original width and height of the bitmap

5035943
width	height
the imageview s height and width are hard-coded in the xml file at 335

5035943
width	height
since the width was scaled down to the the width of the imageview i have to find the scaled down height

5035943
width	height
i just multiplied the ratio of the imageview s width to the bitmap s width times the bitmap s height

5035943
width	height
if the height is greater than the width just reverse the width and height variables

5035946
client-side	server-side
i thought i read in a tutorial on yql by chris heilmann that if you re generating any content client-side with json you should include a server-side function to generate the content at regular intervals for search engines to find

5035980
public	protected
there isn t any standardized idiomatic means i know of to prevent a parent class protected member from being accessed in a sub-derived type but declaring a new public useless member of a clearly-useless kind would be one approach

5036877
google-chrome	firefox
note that it uses jquery and assumes you are running firefox or using tampermonkey if you are on google-chrome

5036899

jsf	seam
pros of jsf + seam default support

5037483
postgresql	mysql
the reason is that i want to maintain the fact that my application can run on both postgresql and mysql

5037505
post	get	post	put	put	get
i d like to use friendly urls similar to rest style something like get for browsing post to add put to edit delete to remove

5037850
textarea	textbox
i should mention that you probably actually want to extend a subclass of textboxbase such as textbox or textarea and not textboxbase directly so you don t have to re-implement the basic text input functionality of those widgets

5038336
getter	setter
i am reading a java book about encapsulation and it mentioned the getter and setter method

5038336
getter	setter
i ve read that to hide the attributes i must mark my instance variables as private and make a public method of getter and setter to access the data

5038336
getter	setter
would it be better if i make the conventional getter and setter method instead and assigned the values on the other class

5038381
getter	setter
traditional you create a single getter and setter for each variable as needed like so

5038381
getter	setter
don t create getter for variables that won t need to be accessed outside of the class and don t create setter for variables that won t need to be set outside of the class

5038381
getter	setter
if following mvc and using the traditional getter and setter like above you would have the view code elsewhere and call something like

5038383
getter	setter
all other classes will have to use other accessors for example getter and setter methods

5038383
getter	setter
you don t have to use getter or setter although sometimes there are good reasons to do so inside the class too

5038383
getter	setter
using getter and setter sometimes makes sense if you do some logging or validating before a value is set

5038387
getter	setter
like i describe in the first paragraph use of accessor methods getter and setter is a more idiomatic approach and easier to understand for someone else using your code

5038394
getter	setter
you use setter and getter to make the variables accessible from outside your class

5038397
put	get
get or create a new instance use it and put it in the pool afterwards

5038414
hide	show
i have a situation that i have a hidden div with two input elements where it hide by default and only show up if i hover something and disappears back if i hover out

5038919
quicksort	mergesort
implementations of mergesort are most common since it is worst case o n logn while quicksort could degrade to o n 2

5038927
getter	setter
i would like to add another great benefit about using encapsulation and is the fact that by hiding the data from its clients just as the examples described above you can guarantee how to set and get these instance variables making your class easier to maintain and test i.e if you have many clients manipulating your objects variables you don t need to go class by class writing the new functionality instead you just modify the getter and setter

5038927
getter	setter
by making usage only of the objects setter and getter the details of its implementation can be hidden from the outside world

5038935

this all works fine in firefox but not in other browsers google-chrome and ie

hash	md5
just for completeness i ll add why you might want to design with the ability to use other hashing algorithms easily - if this was used for any security purposes md5 has been shown to be vulnerable to hash collisions - the us department of homeland security advises that md5 should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use

5041799
integer	unsigned
use a larger signed integer type such as int while doing intermediate calculations this to make sure that over- and underflows can be detected and dealt with in particular not casting to a signed type could force to compiler to promote every type to an unsigned type in which case you wouldn t be able to detect underflows later on

5041803
portrait	landscape
a rotation from portrait to landscape can for example restart your activity and if you re unfortunate your first activity is not gc-ed properly in my case due to some listeners still holding a reference to it

5042278
width	height
you can set height and width like this

5042317
udp	tcp
you can simply use udp tcp sockets

5042333
firefox	safari
everything fine in firefox and safari but in ie obviously it gives me a problem i can t figure out

5042335
integer	unsigned
on the other hand you might mean to interpret the bit value of the memory referenced by some variable to be interpreted as an unsigned byte regardless of the signed integer representation used on the system if it has bit value 0b10000000 it should evaluate to value 128 and 255 for bit value 0b11111111 this is accomplished with reinterpret_cast

5042345
hash	salt
just salt and multiple hash the password

5042426
google-chrome	firefox
i am wondering because it works in google-chrome but not in firefox but it could be due my specific implementation

5042613
post	get
what i get is sometimes 3 post with the same photos sometimes 4 etc.

5042628

of course just use swing or swt

5042662

5042747
multiplying	add
edit a handy trick in case it wasn t apparent is that if you want to order by n things and you re already using compare you can just multiplying each thing by 3 k with the first-to-order being multiplied by the largest power of 3 and add

5042798
google-chrome	firefox
this works in both ie and firefox oh and google-chrome

5042910
puts	gets
he gets the image response and puts it in the imageview

5042936
setinterval	settimeout
however since animations fadings use settimeout setinterval i highly guess that the call depth does not increase it s not prone to stack overflows

5042965
public	protected
if you inherit with private word and that s how you inherit when you don t specify any word for class every method from gtk window become private in mainwindow even if it s declared as public or protected in gtk window

5042965
public	protected
if you inherit with protected word every public methods from base class become protected methods in inherited class

5042997
folder	directory
my solution is now like i said in my first answer change the paths to use the sub directory and then redirect old files to that folder

5042999
put	get
note that if the current statement is a pl sql block - then the entire blockl will get executed with the execute statement so if you put a begin..end around your two statements then they could be run as a unit without running the rest of whatever is on the editor

5043000
freemarker	velocity
if you want to stick more closely to java then another approach is to use a template engine like velocity or freemarker

5043018
inherited	subclassing
does anyone know why i can t add a subclassing that inherited a control from ajaxcontroltoolkit to the toolkit

5043052

have you written files to the folder at this point or just assuming the directory will be deleted since you see it being deleted today without an new files in it

5043403
folder	directory
i m creating a game and i must list only folder in directory

5043404
submit	submission
what you probably want to do is trap the key event and cancel it to prevent the form from submission but maybe you could be more specific about what you do want to submit your form

5043407
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s available in webkit google-chrome safari since a while and in firefox 4

5043411
haskell	scheme
the standard paramorphism recursion scheme isn t in haskell s data.list module though i think it should be

5043457
jtextfield	jlabel
if i use jbutton and jtextfield and jlabel the items do not show up until i interact with them click on the text field mouse over for the button i cant get the label to show up and if i use the normal versions i get the ugly gray backgrounds around the labels

5043481
sorting	grouping
sorting seemed a difficult option so i thought of grouping

5043497
google-chrome	firefox
here s a simplified example that shows the problem in firefox and google-chrome

5043552
redmine	trac
it is just like if you use sourceforge googlecode redmine trac or whatever you have the repo where your actual code is and then you have a broader project that includes your repo but also has things like an issue tracker maybe a wiki etc..

5043564
bmp	pgm
your code would be a lot simpler if you ditched bmp and wrote images as pgm files instead

5043564
bmp	pgm
at the very least if you write your images in pgm and broken bmp you can use imagemagick to reliably convert the pgm to a working bmp

5043588
width	height
i think you should be subtracting the padding from the width in the height instead of adding it

5043603
awt	swing
don t mix swing with awt

5043607
for-loop	loops
i also sucked the if statement into the for-loop expresssions because it s slightly safer that way weird things will not happen if the next token after the close brace of loops body is else

5043705
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

5043713
min	max
the interval min and max should

5043713
min	max
distance between min and max meaning

5043720
gif	png
i think you will have to create it to gif first and then back to png if you wish

5043747
folder	directory
under windows you can use _findfirst and _findnext to iterate through the contents of a directory and then use createfile and getfileinformationbyhandle to determine whether a particular entry is a directory or a folder

5043749
sorting	filtering
it is highly likely you actually do not need an inner loop for the filtering and the sorting

5043754
hide	show
have the scrollviewer sit in column 0 with a columnspan of 3 and then add a button to columns 0 and 2 that you can show and hide when the mouse rolls over that cell of the grid

5043769
uiview	subviews
how uitableviewcell draws its contentview is not how you would normally draw subviews in an uiview

5043776
channelfactory	wshttpbinding
the wcf proxy is generated using channelfactory and uses wshttpbinding

5043840
integer	fractions
he suggests using a mappingtable with fractions indices though i would suggest integer indices

5043851
post	get
you would not be able to post the resulting form back to your site but with some javascript you could read the form data and create another get request by building up the querystring of the url

5043855
printf	strcpy	strcat	gets
examples for functions to avoid strcpy strcat printf gets scanf s ptr

5043855
printf	fgets	printf	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	fgets	strncpy
instead use things like memcpy strncpy or better yet strlcpy though not available everywhere printf fgets

5043857
stdout	stderr
anyway when i run this in an executable script task.communicate doesn t seem to store anything in stdout and stderr

5043857
stdout	stderr
to be precise i get stdout stderr . instead the stderr stream from mcf seems to be leaking to the terminal rather than getting captured by the subprocess pipe

5043857
stdout	stderr
when i step through it line by line in the interpreter stdout and stderr are correctly assigned

5043890
rss	feed
i m implementing a jquery mobile site and i ve hit a snag when trying to show a count of rss feed using

5043954
post	get
there might be a way with groupby to get something similar or you can get the last x items order by date if you know that for example no more than x items are created per specific date and do some post processing in linq but at first sight you re on the good track

5043978
udp	tcp
it provides some of the same service features of both it is message-oriented like udp and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like tcp

5043979
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
stream control transmission protocol sctp is a transport layer protocol providing reliable transport of data like tcp but with message oriented features like udp

5044005
min	max
you could weaken your restriction to allow 0-length values by specifying min and max length

5044020
width	height
replace the #### with your video id 195111727174972 and appropriate width height

5044043
submit	submission
if you re submission a form via ajax and also want to submit a file you might consider placing the file upload in a completely separate form tag then trigger the form submission after the ajax call is successful

5044062
google-chrome	firefox
in ie8 as soon as we exceed 1000 divs the html simply doesn t show works fine in google-chrome and firefox

5044092
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
your tableview should live inside a uiviewcontroller subclass that is itself inside of a uinavigationcontroller

5044151

5044195
children	parent
so the child rows are not sorted at all but the parent are sorted preserving the order of the children

5044218
multiplying	subtract
if you implement the box blur by doing horizontal and vertical strips seperately an extremely fast implementation is just to scan each strip of pixels and maintain a running total adding the pixel radius 2 in front while subtract the pixel radius 2 pixels behind and multiplying by cached 1 radius to calculate the running average

5044226
hide	show
when this happened to me i write a function on event start on lightbox show and there i hide the object ie i place the youtube video inside a div with class name tohide and then o use

5044267
for-loop	loops
to fix it you could split the data into a list of tuples outside the for-loop and loops through that

5044320
post	get
php s string comparisons are case-sensitive and request_method is all-capitals post or get never post or get

5044345
pop-up	dialog
but when javascript wants to close that window internet explorer will normally open a dialog box and ask the user to confirm closing the pop-up

5044345
pop-up	dialog
my old approach with the annoying confirmation dialog was to run iexplore.exe with the pop-up url as parameter via system.diagnostics.process

5044345
pop-up	dialog
thus the pop-up has a base window and javascript can close it without the confirmation dialog

5044355
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop instead or an incrementing variable with the foreach loops to check

5044405
quicksort	heapsort
another instance quicksort is o n 2 in the worst case while technically correct even heapsort is o n 2 in the worst case

5044451
min	max
variables i min max are declared as numeric

5044451
range	min	range	max	min	max
in my case min and max are ofen very large but range itself is small ie

i m having trouble finding metrics on how well erlang scales when scaling is horizontal across a lan wan

5044574
wan	lan
let s assume that i have many tens of thousands physical nodes running erlang on linux that need to communicate and synchronize small infrequent amounts of data across the lan wan

5044595
min	max
you could run the loop variable from 0 to the difference between min and max

5044654
awt	swing
it is oldest resource but by the way java awt swing event queue

5044670
mouse	keyboard
in practice it gets more complicated with modal dialogs and the like but basically it is getting the events from the underlying os for keyboard and mouse and posting them as events on the eventqueue and the various components get those events and use and consume them or pass them along as they wish

5044688
jtextfield	jlabel
you can t do that with a plain text field but you can put a disabled jlabel on top of the jtextfield and hide it if the text field gets the focus

5044694
mvp	presenter
in mvp the presenter assumes the functionality of the middle-man played by the application controller in mvc

5044695

model view presenter mvp is a derivative of the model-view-controller software pattern used mostly for building user interfaces

5044716
cpu	processors
the other way around a 32bit binary on a 64bit cpu is generally possible if the os and processors supports such things

5044717
implements	extends
this extends c++ a little bit adding nice features like more powerful rtti the signals slots mechanism similar to events delegates in c# allowing typesafe callbacks the plugin interface mechanism which provides a way to extends applications by implements a pre-defined interface

freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
this includes windows at least xp and later linux pretty much any distribution mac various unices like freebsd hp-ux solaris and much much more

5044752
caanimation	calayer
the caanimation way also requires that you add it to the view s underlying calayer

5044752
uiview	caanimation
there s additional functionality available by using caanimation but if it s something you re not familiar with chaining uiview animations or resetting it in the completion block is perfectly acceptable

5044759
int	double
all int are guaranteed to be stored exactly in double - so still use the same trick

5044785

the web container i ve found easiest to embed in a jar file and it is still a valid war too is winstone

5044837
post	get
this blog post by lee also seems to get into a pretty details explanation of the process

5044854
folder	directory
publishing to a local folder and then copying the published files via ftp over to my host in the public_html directory

5045010
getter	setter
to be honest i only used setter and getter inside a class in java

5045024
button	checkbox
you need to add an action listener on every checkbox except the seventh one which doesn t have any impact and re-compute the enabled state of the button each time the listener is called

5045047
xml-rpc	json-rpc
both json-rpc and xml-rpc can use http as the underlying transport protocol but can also work with others

5045047
xml-rpc	json-rpc
by now this is the preferred way in javascript development comparison of rest vs xml-rpc is a nice read and applies to json-rpc as well

5045061
int	chars
all arithmetic on unsigned chars values is done by first casting them to int and doing the operations on int values and so c which is equal to -1 - int c will return a negative int value

5045061
int	chars
an explicit cast would be needed to get the unsigned chars result before printing it out and the call to printf would cast it back to int anyway

5045091
int	chars
chars gets promoted to int when you pass it to printf

5045103
gson	jackson
but if that is not possible i think both jackson and gson would require either custom deserializer

the width and height attributes of the canvas element itself decide how many pixels you can draw on

5045549
width	height
if you don t specify the height and width of the canvas element then per the specs

5045549
width	height
the width attribute defaults to 300 and the height attribute defaults to 150.

5045549
width	height

if you aggregate the comments you should either a implements a revision number on the post allowing you to detect race conditions and implements handling of optimistic concurreny or b add new comments with a mongodb modifiers - something like

5046105

5046866
base-class	subclassing
the rest you re telling the compiler that something strange is going on and you re breaking the rules - either the rules of the type system with a reinterpret_cast or a const_cast you re risking representation with a static_cast to a smaller integral type or you re breaking lsp and having to know about specific type of a subclassing when given a base-class

however when i add the button class to an input button google-chrome safari and firefox all add a margin-right 3px .

yolk doesn t know anything about the current virtualenv

5047706
virtualenv	yolk
so run pip install yolk with the virtualenv activated

post	get
after the edit you could either make sure the variables you re going to use have some value just blindly echoing a get post var isn t the best practice - or you could use an object to store the variables you want to output as properties and use __get to return an empty string or a false when the property hasn t been set

5050089
int	chars
and that int are normally 32 bits so 4 chars

5050090
int	chars
if you want to convert an int which is in the range 0-9 to a chars you may usually write something like this

5050099
illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
note that charset.forname ... can throw exceptions illegalcharsetnameexception illegalargumentexception unsupportedcharsetexception but these are all unchecked-exception so you don t have to catch or re-throw them yourself

i think using onpause onresume for this purpose is a bad idea because activity is partially or even fully visible

5050406
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid looks for views in the hierarchy starting from the view from which you re calling it or from hierarchy root if you re calling activity.findviewbyid and of course this works only after setcontentview

now some people in the database will be a parent entity and therefore have children defined

5050461
children	parent
my question is when i load the list of people from the repository is it possible to instruct linq to include the children should any of the people be a parent entity

5050482

edit it will work only in memory ienumerable not in db iqueryable

5050497
libs	buildpath
correction adding the same libs to the buildpath twice once to the one of the project under test and once to the testproject does not work because junit does not understand that both are really the same libs

5050497
libs	buildpath
the solution here is to export external libs from the original project configure buildpath - order and export - select libs to be exported instead of adding them to the buildpath of the test project directly

5050523

in firefox and google-chrome don t know about opera you can use the data uri scheme

5050730
int	boolean
some variables created in this manor such as an array of object seem to be passed as reference and therefore any changes are reflected within globalstate however for almost every other variables boolean strings int it seems the changes aren t reflected and therefore are being copied rather than referenced

5050759
int	boolean
it s exactly the same behaviour for all primitive types int boolean etc

5050772
folder	directory
alternatively make sure the folder name is as distinctive as possible and add a search routine to look for the directory in a number of sensible places at load time

5050776

5050972
inherited	subclassing
you re violating the contract stipulated by the interface by telling its implementer to only return objects of one specific subclassing of classparent which due to the nature of single inherited in classes is why it isn t allowed

5050985

5051011
whenever	capistrano
we deploy with capistrano and use the whenever gem for cron processing

5051032
hash	salt
now with salt added to each password even same passwords generate different hash

5051057
accessor	properties
config accessor do not actually perform i o from your config classes if coded properly as they generate compiled properties so i think this not much of a problem and i doubt you would gain performance from caching it

5051071
width	height
if not this property make the parent of your component disregard the bounds like width and height of your component in render their own bounds

5051078
hash	md5
md5 is a hash as you know so if you give it an input like password you get a unique hopefully - however md5 has collisions these days output like 3de2af...

5051078
hash	salt
the purpose of a salt is to add arbitrary random data to the string being hash such that you increase the length of input to hash

5051078
hash	salt
of course if you re salting with password and you hash password you re hashing passwordpassword which isn t that much more secure so the choice of salt is important too

5051078
hash	salt
ideally you should use a random salt with each hash string but of course you need to know what it is

5051106
umbraco	dotnetnuke
if you re thinking of webforms rather than mvc try dotnetnuke or umbraco both of which are also open source cms s with add-on capabilities though umbraco is in fact transitioning to mvc in the next version

5051177
paredit	slime
for emacs one uses slime with the extensions paredit and redshank

5051178

5051195
put	get
i would like to put together something for tomcat one day so i m experimenting and trying to figure out how not to re-invent the wheel but it just seems like i can t get my hands on the source code for keytool .

5051239
subtraction	addition
saturating addition subtraction on _eps would be cool but isn t really necessary

5051243

5051325
int	double
var to cast to a double xsd int

5051331
subtraction	addition
comparisons would work automatically with a single operations addition and subtraction would need to mask out carry over from eps into padding zeros

5051331
subtraction	addition
there s no obstacle to using mmx for addition and subtraction masking out happens automatically then and ordinary integer comparison for comparisons

5051347
pop-up	dialog
if i push flex button - i can see flex pop-up dialog

width	height
well getting the width and height of a flash file is also interesting for me

5051589
hash	hmac	hash	md5	hmac	md5
so adding an hmac to an md5 hash would make it substantially more difficult to break via a rainbow table

5051638
apache	nginx
other systems such as apache or nginx as fronting web servers can use the same cookie format to authenticate a user

5051642
codeigniter	pyrocms
i would reccomend looking into pyrocms which is also a free beer and speech cms built on codeigniter that directly allows for module development which is straight codeigniter development with a few added meta installation files that would allow you to build the extra functionality you need within the codeigniter structure

5051703
config	ini
if your needs would be easily satisfied with an ini file you may want to use boost.program_options using the config file parser backend which actually writes ini-like files without going through deprecated and slow

width	height
i need to set the height and width of a edittext widget programmatically

5051747

finally i will say until you get the hang of perl s precedence rules it never hurts to put in explicit parentheses for lists and function s arguments

5051796
width	height
if your element is fixed height you can put it on your sprite width 100 width of the sprite with the required max-height of the element

5051796
width	height
or if you know that its max width is smaller then the width of the sprite then make it a rectangle with the max width and height of your element

5051806
qstring	qmap
afterwards from this reference qmap will attempt to copy the argument in this case going through the implicit sharing mechanism of qstring

it appears that the crashes occur during touchesended and touchesmoved events only particularly when i start the touch on the target image but move it off the boundaries of the image in the process

5052184
width	height
for rotate from the center you ll need to add dx and dy to ie filter then add displacement via css and add css hacks to increase elements width and height in ie

5052192
post	get
as i know that in a web browser end users can see the get form values in the address bar but for post method it won t have this issue

5052192
post	get
it makes sense that i should use post in the rationale that the form values are visible in the web browser address when using get but since now i m using httpwebrequest there is no web browser address bar to be seen so is it actually no difference at all

5052196
width	height
4 in ms access columns positioning sort order width row height etc

5052201
put	get
to get the raw float value and put it into a string you would use something like this

5052221
post	get
both get and post data will be in plain text unless you use https

5052228
post	get
both get and post are http verbs

5052232

5052233
glasspane	mouselistener
you can attach mouselistener to it and then use swingutilities.getdeepestcomponentat to figure out which component was clicked on beneath the glasspane

5052247
post	get
from http perspective both get and post requests can be intercepted and modified

5052252
atexit	main
about the only excuse for it is to avoid problems from other bad practices such as functions registered with atexit that depend on the continued existence of local variables defined in main

5052252
stdio	puts
what this does i think is basically references directly the location of a function defined in the implied header filesâ i get the impression that gdb is auto-magically including the header files stdlib.h for system and stdio for puts

post	get
then if you get stuck at least you ll be able to post a much more specific question one that is more easily answered with a specific and helpful answer

5052272
folder	directory
the way i have this working is that each directory is a form submit button that reloads the page when clicked but with a value in _post that tells the site to open or close a folder this is done within an array in _session

5052278
onkeyup	onkeydown
i set up a custom view overrode onkeydown and onkeyup and i have a switch statement to identify the key being pressed

5052312
post	get
and once you do a post you should redirect using get parameters or some other method

5052312
post	get
if you use get parameters instead of post then you can just make the page navigation stateless and just fetch the page they ask for

5052319
post	get
replacing post with get should disable the prompt

5052324
switching	screens
it will only show one of those views at a time however when the user drags their finger over the screens it ll switching to the next or previous view depending on which way the user dragged their finger

5052567
setinterval	settimeout
you can use settimeout or setinterval

5052606
setinterval	settimeout
yes you could use either the javascript settimeout method or setinterval method to invoke the code that you would like to run

5052632
postgresql	mysql
if you do find the need to support multiple database systems then your best option is to simply create two different queries - one to be run on mysql and one to be run on postgresql for example

5052661
setinterval	settimeout
as others have pointed out setinterval and settimeout will do the trick

5052673
min	max
is there a simple way to find the min max property from an array of elements in jquery

most of the time this pertains to the width and or height of an element but i m sure this could be applied to any property of an element

5052702
min	max
they offer a number of math functions like min max and avg on dom-elements

5052703

hash	md5
what i m considering doing as an alternative is have those fields store the data with a primary key on a separate field which has an md5 hash of the data such as md5 field_1+ - +field_2+ - +field_3 and then my script just queries one field such as

5054942

c and c++ don t restrict the exact size of the numeric types the standards only specify a minimum range of values that has to be represented

5055009
int	chars
because the types like chars short int long and so forth are ambiguous they depend on the underlying hardware

could somebody please provide an example where getter and setter are not required

5055187
getter	setter
i mean if you have variables that you just know will not need to be accessed in a particular way don t bother with the getter setter

5055212
getter	setter
an example of when getter setter are not required

5055212
getter	setter
if you are creating a web application for example you might have a bunch of very simple java bean classes like customer that do have getter and setter those are your model classes that model the business domain entities -- but then you d have many more classes like servlets and dao classes and other services with business logic where it wouldn t make sense to have getter setter

5055214
getter	setter
for example if they re only accessed internally than you shouldn t need getter setter

5055239
portrait	landscape
all this works fine in portrait or landscape

5055262
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s working in all recent browsers ie8 firefox safari and google-chrome but will not render adequatly in ie7

5055265
getter	setter
getter and setter have a number of related purposes

5055265
getter	setter
all of these add up to a convincing argument for using setter and getter everywhere

5055265
getter	setter
to my mind there is only two cases where getter and setter are optional

5055265
getter	setter
in these cases the reasons for using getter and setter mostly don t apply

5055265
getter	setter
however if there is a risk that the inner classes implementation details will leak in a revision of the code you should immediately add getter and setter

5055272
sitecore	umbraco
i can only comment mainly on sitecore and a bit on umbraco from my knowledge of others using it

5055455
swing	windowbuilder
i should point out the windowbuilder docs on swing data binding are expressly intended to document how to use the wb tools and not how to use the swing data binding api itself

5055455
swing	windowbuilder
in fact windowbuilder expects you to have a fairly good grasp of swing data binding fundamentals before you can effectively use the tools it provides

5055455
swing	windowbuilder
the bottom line is that if you know how to create the swing data bindings that you need by hand in source you should be able to more rapidly create then using windowbuilder

5055476
swt	swing
the wb docs themselves are quite extensive but intentionally focus on the tool itself and not the apis that it supports swing swt and gwt

inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
data binding is your friend and ria services makes it not so annoying tedious to implement inotifypropertychanged over and over plus it adds lots of other great harder-to-implement interfaces like inotifydataerrorinfo i think and ieditableobject and so forth which many silverlight controls respect out of the box to do the right thing

when i moved a team from cvs to svn almost everyone in the office was thrilled getting something close to changesets was wonderful no more endless tagging before and after every checkin and having some vaguely tolerable move functionality was great

5056164
cvs	svn
the cvs options for move were awful and bad and svn made the downsides small enough to warrant renaming files as needed

5056164
cvs	svn
svn really delivers on its goal of being cvs done right

5057171
pop-up	dialog
as i try to create it a dialog pop-up from eclipse saying cannot find c android tools lib... proguard.cfg

5057179
inline	inlining
the inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units but using the keyword doesn t mean the compiler has to inline the function and not using the keyword doesn t forbid the compiler from inlining the function

i just confirmed its not an overlay issue and definitely a height of input issue as when you add a top margin to the dropdown the height is still small on ie6

5057200
many-to-many	one-to-many
bonus point if i can use the same thing with very little change for a one-to-many relation when an article can only have one author but i don t want to use dropdownlist for that since there can be many authors and it wouldn t be searchable and if i write an async findauthor for the many-to-many scenario i d like to use it in the one-to-many as well

cvs	svn
proper usage of some git svn cvs whatever saves here situation really getting to the point where it worked is great

5057314
disk	ram
in the same time although hosting on a java stack has a higher starting barrier needs ram and processor even if no request is made and grails projects must start with minimum 512 ram for a small medium project to work reasonable when the number of visitors is big it handles them much better than a php interpreter which would need a lot more processing power and disk speed on a high load

5057315
post	get
what i have so far is a script that uses the graph api to get the json list of post and i also have a php file that can like a post who s id is submitted in the post_id query string parameter and this does work

5057335
post	get
so with an ajax post we would usually send data in this format also and not as a query string parameter which is how data is usually sent with a http get request and how you are sending data above

5057342
clang	llvm
you can also compile clang llvm from source for that see here

5057342
clang	llvm
update regarding your edit the frontend description reflects either the fact that llvm can be used as a backend in a gcc compilation through llvm-gcc google has loads of info on this or the fact that clang itself is unable to link your code together into an executable or library

if you want to do the equivalent of what the point version of the method is doing you will have to define an integerholder class that has both a getter and a setter together with methods such as increase that your application needs

5057527
width	height
of course what you need is to remove these declarations of width and height

5057540
width	height
2 you can just set up a fixed height or width only one of them to put the image in a fixed dimension

5057570
hide	show
by default if a user right clicks the icon it will show the menue and will hide it when they click elsewhere

5057618
disk	ram
that means data will be stored in ram only and never written to disk

5057626
width	height
i could achieve the same effect with a texture but since in the settings the board width height can be changed this would be an ugly solution

google-chrome	firefox
and there was an option in firefox google-chrome extensions to save page to an image - though not sure if it was possible to take only part of the page as an image

5057785
snmp	mib
the solution must add its own mib to the windows deployment pc which from what i can tell means it must at least in part provide an unmanaged snmp extension dll to extend the standard windows snmp service

5057785
snmp	mib
can anyone recommend an approach which extends the standard winsows snmp service with extension agents for your own mib that is a good fit with managed code

autofixture	xunit.net
if you feel your code really has unavoidable complexity that you cant make satisfactory by improving the design look at autofixture esp the xunit.net integration - it and and or other automocking containers may be suitable as they directly address the sort of concern you re hilighting in your question

google-chrome	firefox
use firebug or your browser s javascript console in google-chrome on os x the hotkey is alt-cmd-j firefox os x is shift-cmd-j

you can use size_t mpz_sizeinbase mpz_t op int base to get the number of chars to output the number as a string in a specific base

5058327
getattr	setattr
in the c interface it s the other way around an extension class has by default no __dict__ and you would instead explicitly have to add one and add getattr setattr support to handle it although luckily there are methods for this already pyobject_genericgetattr and pyobject_genericsetattr so you don t have to implement them just use them

5058370
pvcs	mks
collaborative development is normally done through a software configuration management or version control system such as subversion pvcs starteam mks sourcesafe cvs or any number of other options of varying cost and sophistication

post	get
this is all i could think of other than creating a class for every http post get etc request i wish to make and extending asynctask.

5058733
post	get
this is the return type for both http get and post and this seems to work ok in my scenarios because i throw exceptions in exceptional http result situations like 404

5058733
post	get
another nice aspect of this setup is that the code to attach parameters to a get or post are fairly similar so this logic is pretty easy to construct

5058734

viewmodel	caliburn.micro
using a viewmodel first approach you can instantiate your viewmodel and then use caliburn.micro to locate your view via convention and automatically bind the two up

5058882
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
caliburn.micro will also do view composition so for example if you have a collection of view models on your parent viewmodel and you expose that collection from a property with the same name as a listbox on your view then caliburn.micro will automatically use the corresponding view for each item in the collection and bind up each items viewmodel with the view

5058884

the difference is that char is unsigned short is signed

5059328
vim	emacs
is there anything like describe-key emacs in vim

5059336
integer	unsigned
the idea is that high - low never overflows if the result is interpreted as an unsigned integer so the unsigned shift correctly performs division by 2 and the formula computes the middle value

i think you should get the parent view and then from there on you can use findviewbyid are you sure you can t just use that method anyway since surfaceview is a subclassing of view and inherited findviewbyid from it

5059586
implements	extends
you can t extends anything else because enum extends something already by specification but you can implements with an enum

5059774
post	get
any parameters passed in a get querystring or form post will be in the params hash

5059832
jpql	hql
given your requirement i guess hql or jpql is the best option and how often you will change the field names

5059837
solaris	aix
alternatively you might be on a machine running aix hp-ux solaris or similar where bin sh is not the same shell as bash at all

5059848
squash	merge
you can use git rebase -i or git merge --squash to collapse squash a bunch of git changesets into a single subversion revision

5059860
folder	directory
how do i make it so that any folder beyond and framework to load the directory index.php file

5059971
codeigniter	cakephp
right now i m pretty good in cakephp i have like 3-4 years in it and i think it has certain flaws the biggest one being its speed and i was thinking of passing over to codeigniter but i need to know something

5059998
for-loop	loops
replace the while loops by a for-loop in delayloop

5060032
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the basic tests i ve done show this is only possible in ie before version 7 and not at all in firefox safari google-chrome

5060050
macvim	textmate	textmate	bbedit
if you want to open a source file into something like macvim textmate bbedit you can use their command-line tools mvim mate or bbedit respectively

5060050
macvim	textmate	textmate	bbedit
you could look into using one of the open3 methods to open apps too though you will have to find the right binary to call unless the app supplies a shortcut like macvim textmate or bbedit

5060079
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
i would suggest you create one nsblockoperation for each object and add it to the nsoperationqueue in the end of each iteration

5060091
haskell	scheme
haskell s list comprehesion translated to scheme for a nicer solution

5060128
dynamic-languages	typechecking
ruby is a dynamic-languages so it usually doesn t rely on strict compile-time typechecking thus making constructions such as templatized fairly useless

5060136
google-chrome	safari
for some reasons i get a long unwanted horizontal scrolling bar that scrolls into blank space on the right side in google-chrome 9.0.597.98 on windows 7 and probably in safari as well

5060174
xapian	whoosh
try with whoosh sorl or xapian

5060195
calloc	malloc
what they mean by zeroing out the initial table for hcreate_r is probable to use calloc instead of malloc

5060215
mouseleave	mouseenter
why don t you use mouseenter and mouseleave

5060221
versioning	upgrade
after returning i upgrade the samsung kies suite to the new versioning 2

5060231
profiling	debugging
if you setup your project for remote debugging profiling you can attach pretty much any java profiling

5060231
profiling	debugging
where 4321 is the port that you need to specify your remote profiling debugging application to attach itself to

5060265
accelerometer	gyroscope
angle phi is the integral of angle velocity omega over the elapsed time and doing numerical integration with the trapezoidal rule like described is ok for gyroscope s data not for accelerometer

5060265
accelerometer	gyroscope
in general i would recommend to use the timestamp delivered by core motion instead of the defined period 1 5 as recommended by apple because device motion data is often delivered in a lower frequency than expected see what is the official iphone 4 maximum gyroscope data update frequency and or push method for core motion and frequency of accelerometer gyroscope data

5060280
children	parent
for example i have parent which has many children

5060305
try-catch	exception-handling
just send it to ad in a try-catch and if it s not validated the reason why will be in the exception-handling message

5060313
children	parent
the way your divs are acting seems like the second is being positioned differently due to the flow of the parent container relative to its children

5060341
datamapper	activerecord
if the class is a generic record handler an activerecord or datamapper there aren t many english words that would apply

5060353
httphandler	httpmodule
in the asp.net world examples include httpmodule httphandler page etc

5060370
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it works

5060395
min	max
i googl ed around seems like postgreesql up to 8.4 doesn t like max and min it does a sequential scan of the table to get the result

5060438
post	get
i ve sorted out how to get each section to highlight just fine when viewing that parent page however ive run into some trouble with achieving the same effect when i choose to view a post or subpage

5060438
post	get
since im utilizing categories to filter content to specific pages i was able to get each section to still highlight when viewing a post by using yet this also caused a few problems as well unfortunately....what happened was as soon as there was content posted to both the blog media section - both sections would highlight simultaneously which is obviously not what were going for here

5060466
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could write 2 routed event handlers for getfocus and lostfocus events by declaring them as attributes of getfocusevent and lostfocusevent or mouseenter and mouseleave depending on whether you want the glowing dimming to happen with an explicit click or reactive to just hovering

5060478
hide	show
i want to make some jquery that show some table rows and hide others based on the content of the first table cell in each row

5060513
post	get
i have a java application trying to post to a php file on an iis server and when i execute the post i get the java.net unknownhostexception

5060535
postgresql	mysql
i happen to like postgresql but mysql can also work

5060566
folder	directory
copy activemq-all.jar to framework base lib folder inside your ofbiz base directory

5060594
postgresql	mysql
so basically i think you should choose a different database back end mysql sql server postgresql and build your application with php or asp asp.net or whatever is available

5060609
sitecore	umbraco
of the ones you mention above i have only used umbraco and sitecore to build with and am certified in both

5060609
post	get
in addition to the links above here are a couple blog post that may help you get a feel for the different systems

5060637
width	height
height 400 width 400 toolbar no menubar no scrollbars no resizable no location no directories no status no

5060641
free	strcpy
does a string created with strcpy need to be free

5060653
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there is a way to do it in the big three firefox google-chrome safari ie and you can find a great example here

5060656
strcpy	malloc
the strcpy function copies a string into a buffer you need to get some other way such as malloc

5060657
free	strcpy
you provide a pointer to the destination buffer for strcpy so it depends on how you allocated that buffer as to whether it needs to be free and how to free it

5060657
free	malloc
for example if you allocated the buffer using malloc then yes you will need to free it

5060716
post	get
so insert if not exists post get id insert if not exists tag get id insert blog post tag with id s

5060718
free	malloc
bytebuffer.allocatedirect allocates memory from the native heap free store think malloc which is in turn wrapped in to a bytebuffer instance

5060780
ubuntu	linux
i am using javacl binding form google code amd accelerated parallel processing sdk 2.3 on ubuntu linux 10.10 hardware amd radeon 5xxxhd

5060783
mvp	presenter
model view presenter paradigm - in fact there are 2 different approaches to mvp proposed on gwt site

5060783
mvp	presenter
thanks to keeping clean mvp it is also possible to unit test presenter logic by mocking displays see my answer

5060785
vb6	vba
vba is in fact a superset of vb6 not a subset -- vba has more functionality built in than vb6 itself

5060824
hash	md5
i m writing a login form and it converts the given password to an md5 hash with then matches it to an already-hashed record in my database

5060840
pascal	delphi
i don t know delphi object pascal

5060861
datamapper	activerecord
if you mean a data access object dao which is a class or classes to function as a bridge between the database records and your application objects try the datamapper or activerecord patterns

5060900
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in ie firefox and google-chrome

5060927
innodb	myisam
i would like to convert some of our myisam tables to innodb so i can take advantage of foreign key support

5060931
disk	ram
if you are asking the more complex version of the question 0 - 10 million repeats allowed then you will need to to sort chunks that fit in ram store them on disk and then you can merge these chunks in linear time and streaming so you don t ever have to store the whole thing in memory

5060932
jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom
if you want a dom-like api - that is one where the xml parser turns the document into a tree of element and attribute nodes - then there are at least four to choose from dom itself jdom dom4j and xom

5060932
xslt	xquery
and of course there are other styles of processing low-level parser interfaces sax and stax data-object binding interfaces jaxb and high-level declarative languages xslt xquery xpath

5060957
try-catch	exception-handling
you could wrap that call in a try-catch structure to handle the exception-handling for whichever items are failing without exiting the loop and the method prematurely

5060966
implements	extends
you might be able to extends recordreader and or fileinputformat and implements what you need to do inside those

5060966
implements	extends
i haven t worked with extends those and not sure about your exact situation it might or not work to extends and implements the different functionality with recordreader and or fileinputformat

5060974
width	margin
have you tried setting the li width to say 16 with a margin of 0.5

5060981
width	margin
instead of defining the width you could just put a margin-left on your li so that the spacing is consistent and just make sure the margin s +li fit within 900px

5060999
post	get
when i was playing with it usually the javascript will open a new post request that request you must get it from request.body which is an inputstream use that inputstream with ioutils to save the file once saved return a json object with the filename or path of the file

5061014
installation	upgrade
i upgrade my rails installation and now when i run

5061061
maven	pom.xml
when i use the maven pom.xml in my laptop i see 7 all 3.0.5

5061070
strdup	malloc
you should avoid this pattern in any language including plain c unless it s clear from the function name what s going on e.g strdup malloc

5061089
getter	setter
assuming jpa rather than strictly hibernate you might do this by applying embedded to a getter setter pair rather than to the private member itself

5061117
children	parent
if you are using orm like hibernate it is common for a parent domain class to write something like this to configure a bidirectional dependency with the children domain class -

5061139
serializable	deserialization
this allows to automatically generate the serializable deserialization code for ios and android

5061153
many-to-many	many-to-one
many-to-one or many-to-many if you

5061181
post	get
give your python script an http or xmlrpc front end and call that with a get post

5061262
width	height
8 191 pixels in width or height and

5061310
post	get
been getting a parsererror from jquery for an ajax request i have tried changing the post to a get returning the data in a few different ways creating classes etc. but i cant seem to figure out what the problem is

5061327
free	strcpy
strcpy itself doesn t allocate memory for the destination string so no it doesn t have to be free

5061327
free	strcpy
of course if something else had allocated memory for it then yes that memory should be free eventually but that has nothing to do with strcpy

5061327
free	strcpy
with strcpy even if you pass in an already-malloc ed block for the destination the responsibility is not being passed so you will still have to free that memory yourself

5061334
post	get
going to try to get someone to post them for me

5061357
hide	show
all widgets including windows in perl gtk support the show hide method

5061357
hide	show
plus you can have as many toplevel windows as you want and just show and hide them as needed

5061363
opera	firefox
the specific problem is that 4800 records take about 30 seconds to bind in internet explorer only 2 seconds in opera firefox

5061366
happy	cup
on top of that they encapsulate everything within an object oriented approach so if that s your cup of tea you ll be happy

5061392
freebsd	linux
however as i m pretty sure a cross-platform solution does not exist i m mainly interested in windows and linux and to a much lesser extent mac os and freebsd

5061392
free	malloc
ideally this would be something more intelligent than calling malloc copying and then calling free on the old block

5061435
free	malloc
you have to pass back the exact same address into free as you were given by malloc

5061435
put	get
then have your malloc16 function call malloc to get a block 16 bytes larger than requested figure out where the aligned area should be put the padding length just before that and return the address of the aligned area

5061435
free	malloc
for free16 you would simply look at the byte before the address given to get the padding length work out the actual address of the malloc ed block from that and pass that to free

5061438
multiplying	add	multiplying	transpose
i have matrix class and i want to add multiplying and take transpose of the matrix

5061447
x86	64bit
for example 64bit linux on x86 64 has a 16-byte long double which is 16-byte aligned - so all memory allocations are 16-byte aligned anyway

5061447
free	malloc
yes - you can only free the pointer returned by malloc

5061452
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
you must free memory using the same pointer returned by malloc posix_memalign or realloc

5061452
realloc	memmove
use realloc as usual including sufficient extra space so if a new address is returned that isn t already aligned you can memmove it slightly to align it

5061466
width	height
maybe think in terms of width and height

5061470
width	height
in your case it certainly makes sense to save the height and width of the matrix and set up the arrays of elements

5061497
wordpress	joomla
the focal point is that i d like to architect it allowing administrator to activate or disactivate more functionalities by adding a new plugin ie he could do that by uploading an xml - as joomla does - or by clicking on activate button - as wordpress does.

5061515
textview	imageview
edit to apply this animation to a button a textview an imageview etc

5061538
width	height
however if you re asking how to fit it within a specific constraint as where the width and the height is 125mm it kind of depends what you want to happen

5061538
width	height
the image is placed in a correct height but the width could be bigger or smaller than the height constraints

5061555
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
since this is the first site we are doing with asp.net asp.net-mvc i was curious how it would handle html.actionlink s in the views

5061585
clang	llvm
i m planning to switch to llvm backend and clang for my objective-c soon if this makes any difference

5061606
decltype	auto
but i guess compilers that support lambdas usually support decltype and auto as well therefore matteo s answer is probably better

5061617
button	checkbox
when you connect an event to a form element that performs an action such as a checkbox or button returning false will prevent that default action

5061638
folder	directory
i have a mac with a folder that i want to clean of all hidden files directory - anything hidden

5061645
put	get
the easiest way to get the root path of your app is to put a module in the root of your app which stores the result of os.path.dirname __file__ then import that where needed

5061672
realloc	malloc
the trickiest requirement is obviously the third one since any malloc realloc based solution is hostage to realloc moving the block to a different alignment

5061678
for-loop	loops
on my system the dedicated for-loop comes out as being roughly twice as fast that s not particularly surprising since loops is executed twice with the generator based approach but it is still interesting to confirm it

5061688
umbraco	n2cms
things like umbraco and n2cms and microsoft orchard and others are simple open source not complicated and should all be good things to start your project from them and develop any functionality you need that doesn t exist as a per their existing plugin architecture

5061693
put	get
i know how get a image from a view i can detect the drag with a gesture recognizers so i have all the setup in place but have not expertise in graphic development so don t know how put this in motion.

5061703
width	height
i tried databinding the canvas s width and height properties but the dimensions always came out as zero which meant that all the images on the canvas would appear dead centre rather than positioned as desired

5061801
mdpi	hdpi
if you want to find the pixels per centimetre using just the logical densities hdpi mdpi ldpi then you may be out of luck

5061813
try-catch	exception-handling
by adding try-catch block i found the exception-handling was occuring because of wrong oracle version

5061842
super	self
copy super self.__class__ self .__new__ self.__class__

5061851
google-chrome	firefox
feel free to take a look using firefox google-chrome and ie8 do not have this problem.

5061860
persistent	transient
sectionnamekeypath might specify a key for a transient property derived from the persistent property

5061904
rdf	owl
where can i download the rdf owl nt data files

5061961
expression-blend	silverlight
i want to make an animation in the silverlight 4 expression-blend 4 - a running man

5061993
union	distinct
for performance reasons use union all instead of union which performs a distinct against the final result

5062003
put	get
i am trying to get the element id from all the heading tags that have a specific class and put that into an array so i can do something with it

5062016
int	chars
when adding a chars mychar you call get mychar and if null create a new item for the map for that chars with an int value of 1

5062035
int	double
-currentplaybacktime returns a nstimeinterval double which you are printing as a signed int

5062035
int	double
try either casting to int int playeridle.currentplaybacktime or printing the double 1.3f

5062044
mouseleave	mouseenter
similar solution can be found here using jquery to set the auto width when focus or mouseenter and set the orignal width back when blur or mouseleave

5062063
public	protected
it needs to use the base class version either directly if polygon _points is accessible public or protected or via accessor functions

5062088
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve programmatically created some uinavigationcontroller and added them to a uitabbarcontroller

5062090
put	get
i know how to put ringtones in the ringtonemanage but i want to be able to set the ringtone that the user pick and also get the title for ringtone the user pick

5062126
for-loop	arrays
i am writing a for-loop to fill an arrays

5062132
freetype	libpng	libjpeg	freetype	libjpeg	libpng
can i compile libjpeg libpng and freetype for android

5062137
oledb	dataadapter
the easiest way to read excel spread sheets imo is to use a dataadapter and an oledb connection as shown in this code project sample

5062159
children	parent
basically you d have to iterate over each top level parent recursively iterate over its children until there are no more children

5062182
pylons	pyramid
pyramid pylons

5062186
post	get
post and get are only carried to the page you request it to

5062186
post	get
session_start creates a session or resumes the current one based on a session identifier passed via a get or post request or passed via a cookie

5062186
post	get
if you were using get or post the session var zipcode would not show up but it would if you are using session

5062206
post	get
but for post and get you need to take the data to the other page explicitly

5062224
onresume	onpause
i have used a tab host with 5 tabs and 3-4 activities in each plus complicated methods http calls and image adapters and there were no issues this way the activites dont call the ondestroy method but just call onpause and then onresume

5062224
onresume	onpause
remove some of the references when onpause is called and then if you need them again just reference them again maybe on onresume

5062285
vbscript	vba
the issue is that activedocument doesn t automatically reference what you think it does in vbscript the way it does in word s vba

5062290
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine in ie google-chrome and safari but firefox gives problems

5062310
addition	multiplication
so my assignment was to read the text files to form the matrices and then perform various functions such as addition and multiplication on the matrices

5062324
google-chrome	safari
hey guys getting a error in webkit browsers google-chrome safari where the padding is being cut off from anchor tags

5062327
hide	show
my idea was to create a list with images in it that would hide all the items first then show the first one then repetitively hide the current li and then show the next one

5062327
hide	show
then when the last item was reached it would hide it then show the first and start the process over

5062327
hide	show
if on last hide this item show first item

5062327
hide	show
if else hide this item show next item

5062327
hide	show
if on last hide this item show first item

5062327
hide	show
if else hide this item show next item

5062327
hide	show
if on first hide this item show last item

5062327
hide	show
if else hide this item show prev item

5062331
hash	salt
the proposed scheme is at best slightly less secure than simply storing the hash of the password and salt

5062343
hide	show
im new to this site but this link show hide multiple divs with select using jquery

5062356
disk	ram
your network devices the disk in your pc having to fetch from ram rather than l2 cache critical paths on your gantt chart trying to walk your kids to school when one is a 7yo speed daemon and the other a 5yo want to stop and look at every single god-damned flower -type -

5062380
children	parent
one approach would be to start with the parent viewgroup loop through its children and their children and so on and then check tags on each one of them

5062399
hide	show
i modified the accepted answer from this question how to show hide divs by select. jquery the question the op linked just so he could see the similarities between doing the two

5062405
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller that contains 3 uiviewcontroller on the stack

5062431
google-chrome	safari
try using another webkit-based browser safari or google-chrome and watch the error console in case something being thrown there

5062438
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the navigation item is owned by the uinavigationcontroller after all so it makes sense to me that changes made to it will not be saved restored depending on which uiviewcontroller is in the uinavigationcontroller s stack

5062454
installation	upgrade
iâ m interested to know what you all think and what strategies you employ for such activities as upgrade windows updates software installation etc

5062473
for-loop	loops
don t use a regex just loops over the string using a for-loop

5062522
google-chrome	firefox
i m having troubles figuring out why google-chrome and firefox are rendering some things differently

5062522

5062535
freetype	libpng	libjpeg	freetype	libjpeg	libpng
can i compile libjpeg libpng and freetype for android

5062581
ant	maven
i usually use maven cause you can have a repository for jars and dependencies this makes life easier but since you have already refactor your code to use ant maybe this is not what you want to use subversion with netbeans then you might want to add another folder for jars like libs or something and then another for the binaries like audio etc

5062597
robocopy	xcopy
if your batch file only needs to run on windows vista or later you can use robocopy instead which is an even more powerful tool than xcopy and is now built into the operating system

5062655
domxpath	domdocument
i have selected 2 elements siblings using php s domdocument with a little help of domxpath

5062661
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i use firefox google-chrome opera ie in that order quite often one of the browsers renders better than the rest

5062680
google-chrome	safari
at this moment the other 3 answers here use this keypress event and that is why they don t work in google-chrome nor safari but if you change that to keydown they ll work on all browsers

5062680
google-chrome	safari
also google-chrome and safari support keyboardevent.keyidentifier which is defined in the old draft of dom level 3 events

5062741
post	get
post the relevant bits of your code along with a better summary of what your trying to do and you ll get more help

5062759
post	put
now you simply put your asp.net controls inside of a form tag and the post back jazz is handled automatically for basic intent and purposes

5062797
cout	ofstream
think about the standard streams classes like cout or ofstream

5062832
ingres	firebird	ingres	postgresql	ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql	postgresql	mysql
i have used dblinq for sometime it is linq provider for other databases which are not supported by default linq to sql provider like oracle postgresql mysql ingres sqlite firebird etc.

5062833
width	height
the height width x and y of both tiles

5062847
ddms	adb
you can use ddms or adb push command to push images onto sdcard

5062863
getter	setter
separate getter setter from the rest of your logic

5062879
getter	setter
i see now that it is just if i call the getter from within the getter not the setter from within the getter

5062888
setinterval	settimeout
you can use settimeout for delaying actions for a set period of time or setinterval if you wish to run it periodically on a given interval

5062905
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r www-data www-data home domain.com

5062914

i have a temporary table with many records these records are coming from an rss feed and need to be inserted periodically

5062991
execvp	fork
execute will fork and the child will use execvp to run another process

5063041
mpfr	mpir
mpfr which requires either gmp or mpir provides a much broader set of floating point operations

5063108

post	get
now not only that the views look clean but you get correct names for the input fields so that you can bind the values back in the post action

5063760
postgresql	mysql
to extend this process with data analysis we need to allow rules to query the database directly but we must retain dbms independence such that queries can be applied to postgresql mssql and mysql

5063775
children	parent
if all children means only direct children simply put a list of children as well as a pointer to the parent on each node

5063775
children	parent
if all children really means all children one option would be to build a string of the ids of each parent and add it as an indexed column

5063775
children	parent
again though this is expensive when you need to change the parent of a node with children

5063787

5064558
decoder	encoder
you abstract away the encoder and decoder into a different interface

5064558
decoder	encoder
then use composition in your data holder class to reference to encoder decoder

5064558
decoder	encoder
if you are using di then the encoder decoder would be injected w o data holder having knowledge of the actual implementation

5064558
decoder	encoder
or have a service that would take data holder instance and apply encoder decoder based on the implentation attached done again using di with that service

however the width height and model settings are applied

5064817
int	chars
an 8-bit microcontroller will almost certainly be able to access an 8-bit chars faster than a 32-bit int

5064817
int	chars
but for 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors data alignment and bulk data access is key int accesses are frequently much faster than chars accesses and long long 64 bit may be faster still for some systems

5064870
i2c	spi
i m faced with the task to write a driver for android os 2.3 and 2.4 to interface with a sensor chip over either spi or i2c

5064870

i assume that i don t have to worry about actually writing the spi or i2c driver myself right

5064870
i2c	spi
do you know of any current spi or i2c drivers for android i could use

5064870

5064925
setinterval	settimeout
instead initiate all the settimeout s you need for the entire animation at the same time with increasing delays in a loop and let them run their course or better yet use setinterval which is the better way of doing animations and how for instance jquery s animations work

5064940
post	get
i noticed that wordpress for example creates what is called an auto draft when you click the new post button to get around problem

5065005
implements	extends
if base was an abstract class you could declare the dosomething as abstract and have the extends classes implements it

5065005
implements	extends
alternatively you could even create an interface with the dosomething method and have which could even be a better decision and have the base class implements it given that only the extends classes would actually implements the method

5065053
inherited	subclassing
i thought private meant that the field will not be directly accessible in subclassing and that this was a fairly basic tenet of class inherited

5065060

how can i make an application with the same ratio width height

5065060
width	height
i have an application with width 800 height 600

5065094
getter	setter
the getter setter methods for the employee object reference emp were missing in the myaction class

5065362
google-chrome	firefox
as you can see it is fine on firefox google-chrome and even ie9 when viewing a local version of the site

5065362
google-chrome	firefox
the only difference between the local and live versions is that the font is being loaded from a different domain on the live site i have set up the cross-domain policy correctly as illustrated by the fact it works on firefox and google-chrome

5065362
google-chrome	firefox
it appears ie8 has a superior rendering engine that is closer to firefox google-chrome than ie9

5065376
int	chars	unsigned	short
as well the 32-bit variables are faster than 8-bit and 16-bit ones so if you have any chars or short loop counters it might be worth updating them to int s or better unsigned int s

5065383
google-chrome	safari
but when i open this page in google-chrome or safari

5065473
portrait	landscape
uiimagepickercontroller camera preview is portrait in landscape app

5065487
paradox	bde
use the tado component to get the data and then use bde components like tquery to import the data to the paradox table

in this case the quickest way to get the results i wanted was to put down the wheel and the chissel and use third party controls from obout the calendar control

5065527
distance	pdist
you can use pdist this function gives you the pairwise distance

5065528
pull	push

if you do not want these fields to be persistent annotate them with transient

5065591
post	get
is there any way to handle it using post method rather than get

when i play the resultant video using the camera app it is rotated 90 degrees and is not longer portrait it is now in landscape and squashed

5065597

the aspect ratio seems to have been swapped width - height height - width

5065649
width	height
ratio width height

5065669
int	chars
update i d also like to point out that the code sample i give may have problems if your machine happens to have different alignment requirements for int than chars

5065697
button	checkbox
i want to change the display to none on the click event of a checkbox button

5065742
hash	salt
as an attacker i can generate a precomputed hash list containing the most common usernames with the weakest and most common passwords - that is if a web programmer is naive enough to salt their passwords with usernames my job as an attacker has become much much easier - the collisions are very predictable

5065799
hash	salt
this is why when you generate the hash of the password instead of hashing once with salt ie

5065833
profiler	yourkit
a good memory profiler i personally use and really like yourkit java profiler should be able to show you where the memory is being used

5065907
put	get
we managed to reach the servlet and also get a hold of the pdf and put it in the response

5065935
int	double
will output int 3 so it works but be carefull about double quotes and simple quotes

5065952
post	get
it actually works and post all the get values correctly

5066012
hide	show
i have a custom attribute yes no and what i want to do is on the product detail page of my magento site show or hide an image based on wether the value of this attribute is yes or no

5066032
post	get
also use post instead of get but not because the string is multiline but because you are storing it in the database

5066042
mouseover	mouseout
my problem is when you mouseover .changepic which is inside .userpic the mouseout event will fire and the image will not be displayed

5066042
mouseover	mouseout
so when you mouseover the images and .changepic the image will still be displayed and the mouseout event will not fire

5066044
profiler	yourkit
i used yourkit profiler to analyze the heap

5066086
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
you want to use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout

5066086
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout bubble so when they fire on elements within the element you re watching you receive them at the element you re watching

5066086
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave only happen when the mouseenter or leaves the specific element in question they don t bubble

5066136
int	double
now i can run the subtract method on two int s double s or even string s but i can t run on mixed which i thought i would be able to because of the .todouble conversion

integer	unsigned
unsigned integer never falls below 0 even after decrementing infinitely clloop 0 will always be true which makes the comparison pointless

5066446
sorting	filtering
the database is much better at sorting and filtering data then your systems so it s best to do as much on the db as you can

5066489
super	self
the only change in super in python 3.x is that you don t need to explicitly pass the current class and self to it

5066529
post	put
this will create a similar string then you can send it 2 server using put or post method....

5066552

i could strip out all the characters that are not numbers or operators but i m not sure this would be safe anyway and it would be nice if the user could use functions like cos sqrt etc.

5066874
vsts	tfs
this includes task-based builds in tfs 2015 visual studio team services tfs 2010-2015 and vsts builds based on windows workflow build process templates and msbuild-based builds in from early on-premise versions of team foundation server

5066888
versioning	upgrade
presently in my office we are using cvs repository which is very old and i m asked to upgrade to any new versioning

5066888
cvs	svn
i did this three times cvs- svn cvs- git- hg svn- hg and it was not a fun job and you need detail knowledge both of cvs and the target tool and the converting tool

5066888
cvs	svn
i reviewed svn which has some advantages and disadvantages over cvs

5066888
pull	push
the centralized workflow basically consist of a central server with the shared repos wehere everyone can pull from and push to

i have a static property - istrial boolean defined in app.xaml.cs and would like to bind to it to hide show the adcontrol from microsoft

5066988
hide	show
you need to enclose it in a div that supports show hide operations

5067086
getter	setter
of course it s better to have private fields and encapsulate with getter and setter i jsut wrote that for simplicity

5067088
getter	setter
obviously this assumes your book class has appropriate getter and setter methods

5067134
min	max
instead of sorting you could just get the min and max of the strings

5067145
png	ico
where im_hint could be ico png jpg and so on

5067199
stdout	stderr
let s assume that we have command x which can be executed in shell and return some result in stdout and stderr

5067204
jobs	cron
nevertheless if you need the feature to show the user status to others imho you have to work with cron jobs and cake shells

5067215
oncreate	onnewintent
i do intialize the textviews and other views in my oncreate but sometimes the app crashes in onnewintent where i do not initialize any variables and directly use the method of that view

5067220
datalist	repeater
you can do it with pure client side javascript regardless of repeater datalist or anything

5067228

5076882
width	height
you should locate this part and comment the piece which output the width and height settings

but i get the error that width and height are read-only

the term directory refers to the way a structured list of document files and folder is stored on the computer

depending on the exact hardware you re targeting it may be relevant that direct3d has a very similar construct in hlsl and nvidia supply a more proprietary equivalent called cg that i think nowadays can compile to glsl or hlsl

5079628
put	get
it creates an imagepanel object a jpanel that draws an image and sizes itself to the image and then places it in a jscrollpane which is then added to the contentpane but you can just get rid of the jscrollpane and put your image jpanel directly in the contentpane instead

in practice i would like to link a 32-bit library when i choose x86 as platform but the 64bit version of it when i choose x64

5080181
qmouseevent	qgraphicsscene
this is probably in my opinion because of the fact that a qgraphicsscene expects a qgraphicsscenemouseevent instead of a qmouseevent

5080181
qevent	qgraphicsscene
why is it so that a qgraphicsscene not accept standard qevent and only qgraphicssceneevent

5080181
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
why is that i can send events to a qgraphicsscene using the sceneevent method but i need to specify a specific qgraphicsitem to send the event to

5080433
public	protected
i override the protected method resolvecore but the only public method exposed is resolve which expects a complex resolutionresult automapper object as it s input

public	protected
the only less than ideal solution i can come up with and have seen suggested when googling for a solution is to stub a public method inside the class that exposes the protected overriden method

5081562
google-chrome	firefox
a good place to start diagnosing what you need to set and how is to use something like firebug and livehttpheaders in firefox or the tools - developer tools mode in google-chrome to see exactly what headers and how the redirect is working and what cookies it is setting and expecting to be available when the redirect happens

viewdidload	viewwillappear
for uiviewcontrollers i used the function family of viewdidload viewwillappear but i haven t been able to find the corresponding functions for nsviewcontroller

5081814
children	parent
instead you use presentmodalviewcontroller to pass control from one controller to another and dismissmodalviewcontroller to pass it back often with self.parentviewcontroller dismissmodalviewcontroller ... so that children can dismiss themselves regardless of the parent

5081814
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you can then use the view controller methods viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisappear and viewwillappear to determine whether you re about to transition from visible to invisible or vice versa

inherited	subclassing
annotations aren t inherited by subclassing by default unless annotated themselves with inherited see james kingsbery s comment below and even then only when they are used at class-level

5082035

uiview	subviews
should i release my subviews of uiview in the viewdidunload when i have references to them as instance variables which retains them

5082374
uiview	subviews
since both uiview and ivars retain then the objects would have 2 in retain-count when view receives memory-warning then the uiview will release the subviews but they still have +1 in retain count so i have to setself.myivar nil

5082524
hash	whirlpool	hash	md5	whirlpool	md5
at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like whirlpool that for example is five times slower than md5 and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to md5

width	height
use its cresolution nested class to set the screen resolution to a new height and width

5082683
width	height
but understand that doing this will only work for height width combinations the display actually supports 800x600 1024x768 etc not 817x435

5082705
width	height
it tells you the width and height x and y offset in pixels without taking into account the scaling of the element

5082736
children	parent
i think the problem with your first approach is that you are keeping the values in the parent s viewstate but never reading the values back in from the children

5082758
post	get
i have had success calling a function within the ror app via a get but i would like to do it using a post

5082758

is there something different i need to do to get this working with a post

5082779

now the problem is that in other browsers then firefox i get the needed results via post if unchecked 0 if checked 1 but in firefox for both cases i get 0 i know that this is because of that hidden field

prepare	execute
if that is true changing the calls to sqlprepare and sqlexecute to explicit prepare execute statements execute over sqlexecdirect could solve the problem

if you are planning on reassigning myusefulregistry you will obviously have to omit the final modifiers and also implements state based on the type parameter by storing it to use again

5083070
width	height
its really your css at fault here you need to define an area div with dimensions like height width that match your input form and then it should not be deformed in the manner you see right now

5083077
width	height
give each image a defined height and width in your new css classes

post	get	post	put	put	get
if you want to avoid those messages which warn the user about resending post and you also want to have multiple proper pages rather than just different steps in javascript you can put the answers in the url as get parameters

i d recommend you to use javascript add a custom handler for form submission and submit form content via ajax and then load the next form on ajax complete

5083133
implements	extends
to sum it up you can either extends the component in this case the vaadin button and have the subclass implements comparable or you can use an itemsorter

just as an aside you should be able to confirm that this is what s happening by looking at the response headers using either firebug or safari google-chrome s developer tools

5083523
put	get
if you have lots of items in the hundreds of thousands it s probably faster to use a min heap after you get the counts the idea being that you put the first n items into the min heap and then only insert an item if its count is larger than the smallest item in the min heap

5083524
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
my problem is that i use a for-loop to loops through the arrays of particles each game tick to update that particles state

5083524
for-loop	loops
my problem is however that the for-loop loops through all the particles in one go each tick and all the particles are updated simultaneously and therefore drawn on top of each other giving the illusion that there is only 1 particle on the screen

5084216
for-loop	arrays
for an arrays using an old-fashioned for-loop with an index is probably the sensible thing to do particularly since you often need to know what the index is anyway

5084216
inherited	properties

the build section of your properties has an output path which is set to bin debugging if you are using this profiling

5085157
implements	extends
for decently sized projects i ve been told that when you have classes extends jpanels that the best practice is to use nested classes to implements the listeners

5085157
implements	extends
for example i could have a class factoryscreen that extends jpanel and have a nested class factoryscreenbrain that implements all the necessary listeners

5085157
implements	extends
i ve never been able to get a good explanation for specific benefits or disadvantages to encapsulating my classes in this fashion and until now have always just had classes that both extends jpanel and implements listeners

5085158
free	malloc
your code correctly does use malloc and free but the way that you re doing so makes the implementation more complicated than is necessary

5085158
free	malloc
now that child is locally-scoped to the loop the memory management will be handled automatically without any need to call malloc or free

5085178
awt	swing
what comes closer is to create a screen capture of the awt component while a swing component is to be shown above and eventually refresh the screen capture now and then

draggable	droppable
i have put all the droppable in a container and simply want to be able to detect when the draggable is hovering over the container of droppables.

5085210
mouseleave	mouseenter
so my next approach was to in the drag start callback do an event listener for mouseenter and mouseleave on the container-- and then stop listening on the drag stop callback.

5085210
mouseleave	mouseenter
when dragging the box to the red dropzone you should see enter when the mouseenter event fires and leave when mouseleave happens

5085215
implements	extends
i think that anything is better than having a class extends a swing component and implements a listener as it gives the class too much disparate responsibilities and sets one up for creating the dreaded switch-board listeners

5085317
hide	show
next up we hide the map initially so that it s not show until we fire up our fancybox

5085329

awt	swing
you should definitely try splitting your applet into 2 jpanels one for awt stuff paint shapes etc and one for swing stuff buttons boxes etc

5087528
awt	swing
you seem to be using the itemlistener class properly but when i saw that it takes two clicks to select a button that was an obvious sign of awt swing mixing painting problems

5087536
pull	push
if your table is variable length you need to either maintain arrays of uilabel and switch or you can also subclass uitableviewcell note that you can provide a custom interface for a uitableviewcell via nib without having to necessarily subclass you don t mention whether you ve subclassed or not hook up the switch event to go to your uitableviewcell subclass then read the corresponding label and or forward the event to the uitableview subclass this is a push model rather than the pull model sometimes this organization is easier to manage than trying to maintain arrays of objects in your uitableviewcell that track objects in individual uitableviewcells

5087563
submit	submission
in order to submit your app to the app store the submission process has to be started using xcode 3.2

5087605
width	height
they are already ordered by the maximum of their width and height largest first

5087703
goto	break
you can use a labeled break or other alternatives as described in an answer to stack overflow question alternative to a goto statement in java but these constructs should be avoided as long as possible as they produce really ugly and hard-to-maintain code

a size is width and height

5087710
width	height
from now on i ll type rects as x y width height

5087753

when writing an application in java that you intend to open source is it generally a good idea to have a lot of getter setter and make variables private

5087755
google-chrome	safari
this works fine in google-chrome and safari

5087758
vsto	add-in
the way the vsto add-in is put together your assembly is likely to be loaded totally separately for the rtd server and for the com add-in and in your problematic cases the rtd instance is loaded first

5087758
vsto	add-in
perhaps you can test with a sample rtd server instead of your own just to confirm that the error is there and not in the wrapper or elsewhere in the vsto add-in

int	chars
so int your first number at numberat 11 4 it gets the 11th chars and the next 4 letters..which in the string died 27-04-2006 black leclã re is 2006

5087766
getter	setter
suppose you have certain flags those aren t going to be used from outside then no need of getter setter for those

5087816
width	height
how i would implement this would probably be a fixed height variable width qhboxlayout with a stretch factor for those indices that need it

5087835
getter	setter
lets put it this way you don t feel any need of having getter setter and you plan to make your properties non-private

5087835
getter	setter
now if you think your few properties need getter setter but not all

5087835
getter	setter
then i would say create getter setter for all of them for the sake of consistency

5087944

5092833
nhibernate	queryover
i need to do this in nhibernate queryover

5092836
hide	show
one way would be to use tabpage to organize your controls into several pages and show hide only tabs that are in use

5092844
portrait	landscape
you need to know the orientation of the device such as locking the user into only portrait or landscape or if you need to be alerted when this changes

5092856
sorting	filtering
the indexing of the columns in wich you need to consider sorting joining filtering pk s and fk s

5092929
freemarker	velocity
so far everything i ve read about velocity freemarker etc are ok for the predefined templates don t have a ui and don t really help with adhoc emails

5092968
firefox	safari
this event correctly mimics the trigger behavior that domcontentloaded achieves in firefox and safari

5093015
put	get
maybe you have forgotten to put an access classifier so it s internal by default and you get this error

5093025
min	max
i am having this idea in my head that this can be solved by calculating max min latitude and longitude and use these as parameters in an sql-query where i use a where clause for filtering...the problem i m facing here is firstly calculating these max min values secondly in an circular area with radius 5km and not a rectangular

5093055
post	get
so looks like a standard is that a get to controller_name is to perform the index action while a post is to perform the create action

5093057
public	protected
if it s not explicitly stated public it might be considered private or protected

5093073
implements	extends
i then implements my own registration controller which extends devise registrationscontroller

5093093
int	chars
so for example the value of the chars 3 is 3 greater than the value of 0 so when you subtract these two values you get the int 3

5093125
freemarker	velocity
using template engine such as velocity or freemarker is the way to go to craft your email template

5093127
cpu	processors
if you want to test for cpu features at run time then you can use the ndk function uint64_t android_getcpufeatures to get the features supported by the processors

5093133
int	chars	int	double
wonder how to declare an array of 3 pointers to functions taking int and returning a pointer to an array of 4 pointers to functions taking double and returning chars

5093204
put	get
if you want to make sure that when any user calls a read method that they get the absolute latest then put a lock around those methods as well

5093206
terminate	timeout
asp.net requests can be terminate by iis if they exceed the timeout iis shuts them down etc

5093207

data in a computer is binary and computers does not understand nor work in hex

5093207
versioning	upgrade
it will make your life easier now and then when you want to upgrade to modern delphi versioning where strings are unicode

5093245
put	get
if you put a wcf service reference into a class library then you will get an app.config with the binding information created in that class library

5093259
public	protected
if you have a class with member variables then it is entirely acceptable to modify those member variables in a member method regardless of whether those member variables are private protected or public

5093262
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
use a framework like caliburn.micro which plugs in a nice set of conventions that will wire up many things based on naming conventions including bindings and viewmodel

5093267
tunnel	vpn
your best bet is to get a vpn tunnel to your host and possibly to the other network in your office i need more info about the network to make a better suggestion

5093290
cpu	processors
you ve got memory bus size processors bus size cache line size register size clock speeds can vary on different parts of the cpu varying number of cycles per instruction instruction latencies chip multi-threading super scalar execution units etc

5093396
jython	pypy
jython 2.5 and pypy are also

5093397
put	get
my web application composes email message according to some template and put it in msmq and the service get it from there

5093422
memcached	apc
otherwise you d need to store an unencrypted version in a durable storage format shared memory such as apc or memcached or in a session file

5093430
single-quotes	double-quotes
this surrounds the arguments in double-quotes so that your single-quotes do not conflict

5093464
post	get
here s my current codes to get popular post from wordpress wp_post table

5093474
equals	tostring
in other words the array overrides clone but not tostring hashcode equals

5093519
children	parent
it selects the parent has a left outer join for the child and makes certain the children isdeleted false

5093538
hide	show
for example i might want to show hide data depending on a person s role in the system

5093577
int	double
by packing a string of 1 int or 1 double it is possible to determine the size of int and double from within ruby itself which gives the same results as using sizeof int or sizeof double because of the implementation of array#pack in c

5093582
google-chrome	firefox
the call returns and works fine in firefox google-chrome but not ie8

5093664
onclick	onsubmit
use a standard form input of type submit give it an id alter the look or text of the submit via javascript as necessary and create onclick onsubmit events as a layer on top of that functionality and have them return false

5093688
int	double
the double negative sign -- converts that value into a negative int and then removes that negation

5093694
disk	ram
it is derived using formulas for the cost of ram to hold a page in the buffer pool and the cost of a fractional disk to perform i o every time a page is needed equating these two costs and solving the equation for the interval between accesses

5093720
getter	setter
what i would do to solve this kind of issues is to have a pair of getter setter

5093725
post	get
so in php i hope there would be some way to create a web service or to create a web page in that page or service get the appropriate parameters by using query string or post and then call the desired functionality of updating the db

5093745
typedef	struct
the complex typedef already tell the compiler that it is a struct

5093750
typedef	struct
in c to declare a struct type you usually have to type in struct again so most programmers typedef it as well

5093790
google-chrome	safari
i read somewhere that safari has more stringent requirements on cross domain scripting - it and google-chrome share the same code base

5093801
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for me in firefox and google-chrome

5093847
mp3	ogg	mp3	flac	flac	ogg
it is used by the aimp2 audio player which you can use to check the sound quality natively supports a lot of formats including mp3 and ogg and uses plugins to support even more including flac

flac	ogg
i wish i could verify ogg and flac but alas i m behind a firewall that has the site blocked

5093930
portrait	landscape
it crops your ios screenshots from iphone ipad portrait landscape normal retina display

5093950
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsentitydescription
so far i ve written a method that takes nspredicate nsmanagedobjectcontext and nsentitydescription as an input and first queries the datastore and returns an entity if it finds one or creates a new one inserts it into the datastore and returns it

5093982
google-chrome	firefox
this will do it in firefox but does not work in google-chrome sarafi or ie

5094004
int	double
note i changed the type to double instead of int but it works the same way

5094041
min	max
anyway i ran the flat file wizard and it created an xml but even with repeating records selected it set the min and max occurrences of 07 08 09 and 10

5094041
min	max
i changed the min to 0 and the max to unbounded

5094063
children	parent
the parent will send this number to all its children

5094101
versioning	upgrade
see the following post for more details feature versioning and upgrade in sharepoint 2010

5094111
dictionary	map
if you wanted this to run faster you could create a dictionary for each list and map the number to how many elements are in each array in a 3- 1 4- 1 5- 2 etc.

5094136
put	get
when i put jquery on my page i get an error error style is null or not an object

5094139
portrait	landscape
if you ve used the resource system to provide different layouts for portrait and landscape modes for example this won t work properly

5094167
background-color	transparency
you would have to give the div a background-color transparency to make the body s background image shine through

5094176
csv	tsv
however if access does not support this you can export to a csv comma seperated values file or a tsv tab seperated values

5094182
for-loop	loops
the second expression in a for-loop means execute the foor loops as long as this is true

5094187
error-handling	try-catch
the code mostly uses try-catch for error-handling

5094190
google-chrome	safari
since this works in google-chrome i d go ahead and call it a safari bug

5094213
inherited	properties
the w3 s background-image documentation specifies that inherited is an invalid declaration for the properties

5094233
google-chrome	firefox
the above works in ie but not in firefox or google-chrome - any idea how i can fix this

5094240
textview	imageview
it usually consists of an imageview and a textview unless you have your own custom tabindicator

5094272
folder	directory
i moved the cake folder out of the normal directory structure so i could use it for multiple apps and i reconfigured my webroot s index.php paths accordingly

5094310
hide	show
i m using jquery show hide to load the content onclick but the child div won t appear

5094351
punctuation	words
it works fine in giving the number of sentences and words but does not give the precise and correct number of characters without whitespaces and punctuation marks

5094421
strstr	substr
read each line and search for each of your substr from contact username using strstr

5094438
pull	push
i am new to core data world and i am using ios 4 as base framework and using core data to perform the operation against my local sqlight db i am designing offline application but at some point when user come online i need to pull some updated data from server and push the same into the local db plus at the same time user might be performing some inserts and updated into same db through ui as well

5094473
int	chars
in this example the part i do not understand is how c an int is being compared to a chars in the switch statement

5094473
int	chars
as i understand it the main argument geopt is working though is the chars array argv so that fact that it deals returns an int seems strange to me my expectation would be an chars and that i would be required to cast any numerical arguments to int

5094473
int	chars
is expecting a chars as i understand it but being given an int

5094473
int	chars
why would getopt use int when it s dealing with a chars array

5094491
stdout	stderr
it appears java -version puts its output on stderr not stdout so you ll have to redirect stderr to stdout to parse it

5094496
bash	shellcheck
however note that this example is simple to compare against the relevant entry in bash pitfalls and the error is automatically caught by shellcheck so now you don t actually need to ask

5094496
stdout	stderr
how can i redirect and append both stdout and stderr to a file with bash

5094496
unix	aix
editing replacing content in multiple files in unix aix without opening it aka scripting search replace so you don t have to manually open a file and edit it

5094508
int	chars
when an int is compared to a chars constant as in the chars constant actually has type int

5094508
int	chars
in fact in c chars and short are second-class citizens and are always promoted to int in expressions so it s no use passing or returning a chars

5094508
int	chars
the fact that getopt returns an int has an additional reason it may return either a valid chars value typically 0..255 or -1

5094552
pop-up	dialog
the way i planned on doing this is to create a separate dialog box for each of the top row of buttons and have a new dialog pop-up when a button is selected

5094552
pop-up	dialog
so far i am able to pop-up the new dialog and hide the main one but it s obvious that something has happened

5094555
maven	pom.xml
merging the modules turned 90 maven projects into 3 with one parent level pom.xml

5094575
post	get
i ve tried making dummy get methods for my class2 object as i ve found suggested in other post on here

5094595
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
preferably in google-chrome safari but firefox would work too

5094608
vim	emacs
even if you use more elaborate tools like vim or emacs or whatever fancy editor you want typing commands on a command line is not an ide

5094614
qstring	qlist
qt is a little easier because it is c++ based but you will have some translation to do between c++ native types and qt types like qstring qlist etc... that are used internally

5094623
rdf	owl
rdf owl databases feel very immature to me in general so expect to encounter some significant technical hurtles

5094686
backgrounding	multitasking
if you can figure out how to make your app fit within the bounds of app states and multitasking under the backgrounding execution and multitasking section then the answer is yes

5094687
portrait	landscape
now i want to set the orientation for both means when app launch on iphone then it open in portrait mode and when the app launch on ipad then it open in landscape mode

5094699
put	get
the most common ftp operations that a client will initiate include downloading files get files from the server and uploading files put files on the server

5094707
hide	show
it contains various controls to allow the user to show hide sections or sort rows in tables

5094762
pull	push
so this would be workaround number 1 don t let them push have them fork and then pull from them

5094762
pull	push
this is a combination of the two other approaches have one repository that your collaborators can push to and another one that only you have access to that you pull into from the first repository

5094839
implements	extends
the answer is because you can implements multiple interfaces but can t extends multiple abstract classes

5094856
pop-up	dialog
apply the dialog class to your modal pop-up panel and supply the dialog-bkg class in the backgroundcssclass property of the modalpopupextender

5094899
google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome firefox

5094957
packets	pcap
a udp packets stream arrives at machine x which is running two programs - one which is listening for the packets with recv and another which is running pcap

5094957
packets	pcap
in this case as i understand it the packets are stored in the interface until it is polled by the kernal which then moves them into a buffer in the kernals memory and copies the packets into another two buffers - one buffer for the program listening with recv and one buffer for the program listening with pcap

5094988
google-chrome	firefox
i only need to support latest firefox and google-chrome so ie8 isn t an issue

5095030
public	protected
just create a new temporary app that makes all protected private internal functions public plug that into nunit run the tests there and then go back to using the private functions for the release version

5095073
many-to-one	one-to-many
the parent to child is a one-to-many while the child to parent is a many-to-one

5095083
post	get
note you are specifying to use get on your controller method so you can configure a specific post method to be able to receive both get and post form restfull methods something like this

5095090
yelp	zillow
all the other iframed ummapped contents yelp schools zillow stats etc appears correctly

5095110
nunit	moles
secondly if by testing purposes you mean a framework like nunit you might want to check out microsoft moles which allows you to substitute any static method call with your own custom implementation while testing

5095150
typemock	moles
sorry can t give you specifics on the problems i faced - typemock was definitely more powerful to use as it is a lot older and mature - pex moles is fun though i found the tutorial for sharepoint rather nice unit testing sharepoint foundation with microsoft pex and mole

5095161
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox etc the execution runs fast and fine

5095189
post	get
there was an extra newline character inserted which has no means in get requests but matters in post ones

5095219
move	drag
i m working on a small cocoa utility that lets the user drag files onto its window and then move those to a different folder

5095241
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that when i add new lines in firefox and google-chrome the new lines are completely ignored by the form submission process and they never get passed through into the _post array

5095253
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it works normally without lag but in firefox it s slow

5095263
button	checkbox
plus anything else like whether a bit or boolean should be represented by a checkbox or a yes no dropdown or a radio button

5095272
integer	unsigned
the variable type uint32_t is an unsigned 32-bit integer data type defined according to the so-called c99 standard

5095275
google-chrome	firefox
i have my site and it looks great on firefox sf ie8 but on google-chrome it shows a blank page but if you click on view source it is there

5095298
portrait	landscape
when in portrait mode it scrolls fine but when in landscape even if i set an arbitrary value let s say 1400px it doesn t really scroll along that size removing around 400 pixels and it stops before the content is fully visible

5095336
mouse	keyboard
edit ie behaves differently if the select is focused with the mouse or keyboard

5095336
mouse	keyboard
when focused with the mouse keyboarding through options does not fire onchange but when tabbing to focus it via keyboard the onchange does fire when arrowing through

5095359
uiview	subviews
inside the xib i have a uiview and 3 subviews 2 lables and a button

5095399
prepare	execute
i finally found the problem and it was that psqlodbc s sqlprepare sqlexecute by default doesn t execute a prepare execute

5095414
singleton	facade
facade singleton is only responsible for receiving packets and passing it on to the processing it does not wait for processing complete event

5095443
hide	show
hide the wrapper element show the content element using jquery fade

5095446
width	height
i created a standard uitableviewcell however i altered the frame of the cell to my own custom frame of 1000 width by 50 height catered to my needs for project

5095465
for-loop	loops
if you observe the two for loops each for-loop gives an o n because each loops is incrementing decrementing in a linear fashion

5095494
width	height
however wpf will call canexecute on the button s command before the imagescrollviewer control is necessarily laid out rendered - so there is no actual width height

5095500
int	chars
in the general case of assigning an int value to a chars object the compiler doesn t know whether the int is out of range of the chars

5095500
int	chars
a narrowing conversion like int to chars if int has a larger range than chars yields some implementation-defined conversion

5095515
implements	extends
you can t do this with interfaces but you can implements multiple interfaces extends only one parent class

5095525
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
from reading various blogs and staying somewhat updated i ve read about libraries similar to backbone.js and javascriptmvc which both sound like good alternatives in order to make the code more modular and separated

5095550
disk	ram
the underlying assumption is that the limit to the life of a disk is how many disk seeks there are while ram has a fixed cost for its size and a fixed lifetime regardless of how often it is accessed

5095550
disk	ram
what they are trying to find is the break even point between where it is cheaper to keep data on disk or in ram

5095550
disk	ram
if you re processing large data sets and don t want to pay to keep it all in ram then you will be streaming data to from disk

5095568
google-chrome	firefox
here is the code i have this is working fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie7

5095600
nstableview	nstabview
i have an nstableview bound to the parent entities arraycontroller on the first tab of an nstabview

5095600
nstableview	nstabview
the second tab of the nstabview has another nstableview which is bound to the child entities arraycontroller

5095600
children	parent
what i m trying to do is allow the user to select an entity from the list of parent then switch tabs and work with the list of children

5095600
children	parent
what s happening is that if i start the app with an empty storedata file i can add parent but cannot add children

5095600
children	parent
if i add some parent then restart the app i can add children

5095600
children	parent
the list of children however doesn t seem to be filtered by which parent is selected on the first tab

5095607
direct3d	gdi	direct3d	direct2d	gdi	direct2d
you can use gdi + opengl direct3d direct2d as well if you re using vista 7

5095654
put	get
beyond that i would put some more thought into how i was getting to these nested loops in the first place and try to get rid of as many as possible

5095657
public	protected
for completeness here is a copy of gaurav s answer using visibility modifiers private protected public

5095663
post	get
i haven t tried this yet but if you re creating pages on the remote wiki whose url you know then it looks as if the way to do it is described in which says that you need to get an edit token and then post with the token your page contents etc

5095698
free	malloc
then you ve free it and asked for another buffer and malloc happens to have handed you the same memory again this time containing the values you left in it

5095744
actionscript	mxml
the way it works is the mxml is compiled into intermediary as3 then that as3 along with any other as files are compiled into actionscript bytecode abc and that is all linked up into a swf file

5095749
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
see graphaã l - scalable vector charts that work in firefox safari google-chrome opera and even internet explorer 6+

5095788
sudo	passwd
another solution if you really can t use sudo with nopasswd is connect via ssh using the user credentials user passwd with paramiko

5095816
width	height
i mentioned width 1800 height 1800 for usercontrol in mainpage.xaml

5095849
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
if it does compile then your next step would be to open the file you want to transfer on the server with a fileinputstream and a new file for writing on the client with fileoutputstream

5095858
getter	setter
when i have marshaling issues with simple types i tend to create an extra getter and possibly setter to simplify it

5095867
post	get
i m attempting to upload a file asynchronously using http post and jquery but i m running into a strange issue i can t get the right callback to fire

5095879
postgresql	mysql
fortunately gis extensions available both for mysql and for postgresql

5095891
hide	show
i have a and a following it and i want show hide this select element when the radio button is selected or unselected

5095906
stateless	stateful
a pool is a collection of stateless objects a cache is one of stateful objects

5095912
uiview	subviews
if you want to use an image as the background create a uiimageview and add it as a subviews of the uiview

5095938

add a single top-level view if it doesn t have one already as your main view and add your other custom elements uilabels and uiimageviews as subviews of the main uiview

my assumption is that my usercontrol should know how to slide itself into view and out of view this control is basically a glorified input dialog so it will be told to show it self externally but only it will know when it hide itself

5097234
google-chrome	firefox
edit it works in google-chrome but not in firefox or ie

5097239
getter	setter
by not referencing the property with self you are bypassing the properties auto generated setter and getter

5097264
daemon	cron
you could build a script and let it run as a daemon and perform certain tasks on a set interval but that s actually just simulating cron .

5097264
daemon	cron
there is also a great comparison between daemon and cron inthere worth the read

5097282

in webkit what google-chrome or safari uses debug tools click the scripts section on the top

5097383
gmp	bigint

5097508
put	get
if you don t put in a lot of tricky type declarations just right you don t get any speedup

5097544
gridview	detailsview
now the application gets the read data from a gridview but when i attempt to get the detailsview with edit permission it fails

5097547
post	get
you could also append the variable to the form s action value but that would be passing that param via get instead of post

5097547
post	get
without a hidden input appended to the form prior to allowing the default browser submit action there is no way to access the raw post data of the http request before it s been submitted - it s a chicken before the egg dilemma - what you re intending to do is change the http post data headers that get sent to the next page but the only way that data exists prior to the browser posting the data to the next page is by having the input tags embedded within the form element

5097561

getter	setter
the only way i can think of enforcing this would be to have a cararray class that has getter setter etc

5097626
for-loop	loops
you re putting the condition in the for-loop instead of an if inside of loops hence if it s not met even once it breaks out of the entire loops

5097650
for-loop	loops
first you are setting i as n-1 so it would be 4 if n is 5 then your condition on the for-loop states that i must be odd which 4 is not so it doesn t even do one loops

5097663
for-loop	loops
after it goes into the second for-loop it doesn t go back to the first loops instead it ends the program

feedparser	beautifulsoup
my guess is that beautifulsoup is installed strangely or that the feedparser code you re running has been modified in some way

5098560

5098949
integer	unsigned
this is analogous to the question of how many digits can be stored in a binary integer an unsigned 32 bit integer can store integers with up to 32 bits which doesn t precisely map to any number of decimal digits all integers of up to 9 decimal digits can be stored but a lot of 10-digit numbers can be stored as well
