csv	xml
the strings could be anything perhaps xml in themselves or perhaps csv data or something like that

1000028
radio	click
in ie6 click the button doesn t focus the control unless i ve already tabbed through the radio at least once in which case it works

1000028
radio-button	button
i can hit spaces to activate the radio-button and also use arrow key to change the active button

1000039
selected	button
actually it s focussing you can test it by focusing the second item and after click the button click spaces you can see the second item selected

1000062
versioning	upgrade
ssis sql-server integration service is an upgrade of dts data transformation service which is a feature of the previous versioning of sql-server

1000066
logout	login
after login on every refresh of page i am not able to retrieve the cookies set by the provider .so that i can delete them .when user desires to logout

1000066
authentication	logout
is there any other way to gracefully logout the user without trying to search for cookies etc. or releasing the token provided by them after authentication

1000110
ref	out
.so if you were able to use out or ref in your iterator methods you would get surprising behavior like this

1000112
instances	private
for my purposes we developed our own in house tool using the typica libs and several other tools that allowed us to give machines abstract named and launchd configure and issue cmd to them via their named rather than instances id s or private dns s

1000132
python	perl
i d prefer either perl or python

1000132
python	perl
i m comfortable with perl since i use it at work whereas python i need more practice in and it ll make my python evangelist friend happy

1000132
python	perl
anyway shortened versioning can you named a good libs module for either python or perl that will allow me to easily extraction id3 metadata from a pile of mp3s

1000141
hide	show
with a dummy button btnloader to allow me to access the show and hide from code-behind

1000161
document-ready	.when
then you could make use of the document-ready functionality in jquery to determine .when the page is done loading

1000163
value	field
e. the public field of my as and java classes are namedd identically and have the same types and value as the respective field in the database-table which has the same named as those classes

1000172
contains	any
t think there is any such standards but it does make sense to have a single document that contains the functional specifications that can also be used as acceptance-testing cases

1000173
internet-explorer	firefox
this is how it looks in firefox and internet-explorer

1000177
jrules	ilog
we use ilog jrules for defining such rules

1000195
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
either an open source php python ruby application or a company providing a web service api

1000200
.when	ready
have the first document load the second document .when it s ready

1000204
ruby-on-rails	django
forget about both and use j2ee ruby-on-rails merb django etc

1000209
abstract-class	base-class
in php it was simple and straightforward to use abstract-class to create a cascading overrides pattern basically the base-class methods will take care of it unless the inheriting class has a methods with the same signature

1000218
swing	swt	swing	awt	swt	awt
any case where a methods is deprecated because of defective design think anything dealing with date s in java or because a better way is now supported think awt to swing or swt required far to much thought to be automated

1000224
insertion-sort	binary-search
while reading the input file .when you don t yet know all wordss that are in the input binary-search to test if the words is already in the table insertion-sort if it is not using lexical order for both of these algorithms.

1000248
base-class	inherited
new has nothing to do with inherited but can instead be used in a descendant class on a member to hide a member in the base-class that has the exact same signature

1000278
32-bit	64bit
what option should i selected for compliing assemblies on a 64bit plaform for a 32-bit platform server

1000278
platform	anycpu
should i use anycpu option on a 64bit machine or mixed platform option

1000282
implements	abstract
abstract .when you don t wish to perform any process in your base-class but want that methods to be implements by any inheriting class

1000282
implements	abstract
a function specified as abstract must be implements in the child class the compiler will throw an error if not

1000286
buffering	streaming
it looks as though tomcat is buffering the entire response instead of streaming it

1000293
contains	any
you re writing ansi.txt in the first line but that s certainly not ascii as ascii doesn t contains any accented characters

1000293
contains	any
the ansi file won t contains any preamble indicating that it s ansi rather than ascii or utf-8

1000294
buildpath	libs
if you re using eclipse flex builder go to project properties - flex buildpath - libs path - add swc

1000297
javascript	dom
given broken html firefox will do a good job of compensating for author errors but .when the broken dom is generator with javascript you bypass some of the autocorrection routines

1000297
quirks-mode	doctype
as an aside your doctype html + transitional + no systemd identifier triggers quirks-mode - which doesn t generally help matters

1000297
javascript	dom
write javascript to generator the dom you have now tested as being valid

1000299
put	get
i m currently building an .app for my work it work perfectly on my pc but one i put the compile code on to the 2008 server with sql-server 2005 and run it i get an sql error truncat data

1000304
output	mode	oprofile	gprof
oprofile has a mode to directly output gprof compatible data

1000337
javascript	dom
forgive me if i m missing something but checked for a dom elements in javascript is usually pretty easy

1000362
tuples	set
over the set of rows in some table or the set of tuples in some

1000394
packet-capture	tcp
a tcp packet-capture and .net tab in firebug should confirm that the response was completely sent back by the php scripting

1000395
expression	brackets
alternatively you can avoid declare and use arithmetic expression brackets

1000436
buffering	streaming
the following code is able to streaming data to the client allocation only a small buffering buffering_size this is a soft points since you may want to adjust it

1000445
exception-handling	error-handling
of course you are free to choose the way of error-handling bool return-value real exception-handling global error variables â you named it

1000473
binary-tree	linked-list
there s no need to write your own linked-list or binary-tree implementation but every one out there will use pointers and expect you to understand them

1000473
pointers	stack
additionally if you want to put something somewhere other than stack you ll need to use pointers

1000486
linux	unix
however librsync itself can be built on windows as well as unix and gnu linux see their readme and this ee thread

1000489
hide	show
use say jquery to show hide each grouping

1000489
css-float	fieldset	fieldset	labels
finally if the labels are short enough give the fieldset a width and make them into columns using css-float or absolute positioning

1000492
sql-server	mysql
sql-server and mysql are vastly different platform

1000492
sql-server	mysql	compatibility	platform
it would possibly work between several versioning of sql-server since at least there are attempts to maintain some kind of compatibility between the versioning of same platform but this definitely won t work for porting to mysql

1000492
sql-server	mysql
this is because in sql-server the variables have batch-file scoping while in mysql they have session scoping

1000493
put	get
to the excellent points that have already been made here i would add that there is something about the high speed in which flash project are put together and the fact that most will not need to be maintained that encourages people to just get things done as quickly as possible and singleton are a good way to make that happen and you can use getinstance rather than passing around references dependancy injection etc

1000522
logout	login
login lost passwd logout

1000522
python	java
i just want to know what people do not in python ruby-on-rails etc but in good old java

1000551
implements	abstract
a concrete class that inherited an abstract generics class that implements an interface

1000577
exception-handling	try-catch
for the purpose of debugging i want to disable this try-catch and simply let the exception-handling cause a crash in the callee process as would normally happen with an uncaught c++ exception-handling

1000593
firefox	opera
building your site using firefox or opera on any platform

1000593
versioning	upgrade
test in ie 7 if you like and do the same or use conditional-comments to ask users politely to upgrade their versioning of ie

1000593
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
finally try enlarging the text in firefox opera ie and safari

1000593
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
in practice i find that if a site has valid code and works in firefox safari and opera it ll probably be okay in ie7 up

1000598
jquery-plugins	jquery
i think that once you have include all the different jquery-plugins to achieve a jquery user-interface you could have the entire yuser-interface libs which is in my honest opinion far supirior

1000599
dictionary	arrays
read this scott hanselman s computerzen.com - asp.net wire format for model binding to arrays lists collections dictionary

1000636
sql-server	mysql
they are not showing properly while using the mysql odbc drivers but they are showing up properly while using the sql-server odbc drivers

1000640
javafx	swing
any swing component can be embedded in a javafx scene graphing using the swingcomponent wrap function

1000656
javafx	swing
from what i understand the javafx libs do not have that many proper user-interface components but since javafx allows you to use any swing component it might be useful to know swing

1000666
keyboard	mouse
in glade the fake-window that allows you to drag-and-drop components handles your mouse keyboard events and makes the backend call to put the gui elements in-place

1000666
contains	elements
your events buser-interfacelding xml files which contains the user-interface elements and internal designer handler

1000677
configuration-files	web-config
the 500.19 error is indeed caused by errors in configuration-files but not necessarily applicationhost.config it can also be caused by errors in the web-config file for the application or any web-config file that applies to the application virtual folder site

1000741
revision	svn
if you know the revision numbers of the two building you can use svn log

1000742
aes	rsa
asymmetric encryption such as rsa have the notion of key pairs where each key in the pair can decrypt data encrypted with the other key in contrast to symmetric encryption such as aes where the same key works for both encryption and decryption

1000759
cvs	git	version-control	git	version-control	cvs
if you are forced to use git guerilla styles your company is stuck using cvs for the version-control and you use git on your workstation to make life easier you might consider doing something like this

1000759
cvs	git
otherwise you can have git commit older than the cvs ones which isn t that useful.

1000791
aes	rsa
the most practical use of assymmetric encryption like rsa is to encrypt the symmetric key for aes or similar algorithm that were used to encrypt the data and also to sign a secure hash of the messages digest sha-256 etc

1000796
panels	grid
then you can defined the layout may be in grid panels button on the top radgridview bellow them etc

1000803
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
one of the team actually rewrote the database layer to use oracle or postgresql or mysql but it was slightly slower than the original

1000815
display	height
this works fine but .when i rotate back to portrait the view display correctly and then jumps up by what i m guessing is the height of the nav bar

1000860
twitter	gmail
its working fine .when i run through web browser but i want a user should be able to updates status of twitter account through gmail chat he should only be authentication once through web then he should be able to send the status messages through gmail chat and his twitter account should be updatess

1000860
twitter	gmail
how can i inegrate this because gmail id can be different from twitter id

1000880
webforms	asp.net
i m using asp.net webforms

1000886
diagram	erd
if it doesn t have to be an erd and can be say a uml class-diagram you have a bit more scoping because you can high level entities that effectively encompass multiple tables .so you can have diagram at different levels

1000890
value	field
either in your modeladmin.formfield_overrides or modeladmin.formfield_for_dbfield or in a custom modelform you need to assign a custom widget to the name_slug field that just display the value of the field rather than display an html form input

1000898
png	gif
using imagick ghostscript you can convert the pdf to some bitmap format gif png or jpg

1000906
checkboxlist	databound
if you don t want to iterate each checkbox after the checkboxlist has been databound you ll have to updates your dataset first before you bind to it

1000908
protected	public
but a base-class should have a destructor that is public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

1000916
constructor	private
if you are willing to only allow the class to be created by a factory-method you can have a private constructor

1000929
player	movie
i took a working 100 cocoa-touch project ie pragmatic programmers - coding in objective-c 2.0 - movie player and tried to selected and refactor an ivar

1000963
export	csv
export an excel file as csv can be an alternative option see bill krawin s .post - as a new .poster i can t add comment yet

1001006
lcov	gcov
i would suggest using gcov in conjunction with lcov

1001017
onchange	onkeyup
use onchange instead of onkeyup in this case

1001029
perl	php
xampp for windows contains apache mysql php + pear perl mod_php mod_perl mod_ssl openssl phpmyadmin webalizer mercury mail transport systemd for win32 and netware systemdd v3.32 ming jpgraph filezilla ftp-server mcrypt eaccelerator sqlite and web-dav + mod_auth_mysql

1001029
cherrypy	django
that s enough to have a good django production server up and running since cherrypy s webserver is written in python and is pretty good to serve django or any other wsgi -compatible applications

1001053
iptables	tor
as for blocking tor you are best of blocking the tor exit nodes with iptables

1001055
constructor	object
each of the child classes would have a constructor that either returned a blessed object or undef

1001056
silverlight	wpf
silverlight vs wpf

1001056
silverlight	wpf
first of all wpf is not exactly silverlight

1001056
silverlight	wpf
you can use xaml to develop user experiences in silverlight and wpf and as long as you stick to the silverlight subset you can compile your xaml in wpf as well

1001062
any	set
this access methods required that the function use the permission attributes -- if set to public the default or private or package or any role levels etc then you ll get a methods not found error .when attempting to access it remotely

1001062
json	xml
it supports json xml and wddx

1001082
project-management	project
i would like to follow risk driven project-management across all project

1001127
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i m a websphere esb consultant for ibm

1001127
websphere	ibm
in practice you will need websphere integration developer wid to do that - it would be a lot of work to create the mediations manually it s not documented and it s not supported by ibm either

1001141
textbox	button
however .when i tried putting interactive controls on the control i got the following messages in my webmethods .so the jquery call stuff is irrelevant further testing showed that textbox and button cause the issue but not labels

1001172
content-length	content-type
.when you re posting at minimum you need to defined the content-type and content-length

1001192
scp	ssh
you should be using scp secure copy rather than ssh secure shell

1001193
contains	elements	contains	set
does nothing except set the positioning context for all the elements contains within it

1001193
contains	elements	contains	any
you can then positioning absolute any elements it contains by setting typically one or two value from the possible top right bottom or left

1001193
contains	elements
to positioning something absolutely you need to ask absolutely but relative to which contains elements

1001196
activerecord	datamapper
between activerecord and datamapper i d chose the latter

1001196
activerecord	datamapper
both use the activerecord pattern .so you ll actually get your database tables back in object without fancy domain logic but datamapper is way easier to work with and is thread-safe

1001202
factory-pattern	proxy-pattern
i have now found a solution that will work for me...iâ m using the proxy-pattern combined with the factory-pattern

1001250
lcov	gcov
this should result in only the targeted areas emitting gcov artifacts which are blindly consumed by the lcov scripting

1001256
value	field
i m just using a jquery.each data function i val to get the field named and value for the field from the database and then automatically populate the field with that value

1001260
project-management	project
i don t think that it comprises such a major portion of the project-management process that it should drive project

1001260
project-management	project
each project will have it s own natural drivers and in some cases risk will comprise a major portion of the required project-management attention

1001286
abstract	extends
code littered with designated extension points such as protected methods or components acquired via abstract factory - which all turn out to be not quite what you actually need .when you do have to extends the functionality

1001315
neo4j	mysql
and as a additional bonus our initial prototype code for loading our data into neo4j is actually performing faster than the previous mysql versioning

1001322
text-editor	editor
my editor extends text-editor .so .when i reimplement methods iseditable to always return false

1001323
entity-relationship	diagram
while not primarily a database tool it can reventity-relationshipse-engineentity-relationship a database into an entity-relationship model then you can create one or more diagram from that model

1001343
32-bit	64bit
that s exactly the points of a 64bit systemd compared to 32-bit to be able to address more than 2 32 location from a pointsers

1001360
attributes	properties
i suggest that you also manually assign disp-ids to the public methods and properties using the dispid attributes

1001371
revision	svn	revision	updates
.when you run svn updates after the commit the changes will be gone in the working copy because subversion revert everything back to the revision 12345

1001374
environment	building
has macintosh any types of application dev environment for building drivers

1001390
defined	declare
defined the templates code in the same header file as the templates is declare

1001394
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this solution works on ie7 firefox safari google-chrome and opera

1001406
stax	sax
it s not a replacement for sax or stax

1001459
stax	sax
you can use sax fast simple or stax faster not quite .so simple

1001459
jdom	xom
if you need to keep the tree in memory to navigate xom or jdom are good choices

1001459
stax	sax
if you want to hook other pre-made parts up in the chaining often sax or stax work well since they might building their own model in memory

1001459
xquery	xslt	stax	sax
for example the saxon xslt xquery engine works with dom sax or stax but building internally a tinytree default or dom optional

1001459
stax	sax
datadirect xquery works with sax stax or dom also but really likes stax

1001475
ref	out
.so my question is other than creating a wrapper methods with no ref or out params to call from my anonymous methods is there a easier way to accomplish this

1001476
environment	building
the goal is to manage the entire building lifecycle from creation through various testing tools and deployment environment out through release to production

1001483
order	add
just make sure to add them in the right order or call

1001502
ref	out
actually you can use ref and out - just not directly with the calling methods s parameters

1001531
directory	folder
you can set up individual sites in iis that points to the a sharedd directory or use a virtual directory in each where all the logic sits but you can t shared the app_code folder

1001535
g++	gcc
hi all quick question i m in a situation where it would be useful to generator my c++ executable using only gcc without g++

1001535
g++	gcc
now based on what i understood from the gcc manpage i may be way off .so tell me if i am g++ is basically gcc but it links the c++ libs

1001545
json	xml
once it recieves the json or xml data it populate the data to your widget which are bound to the datasource

1001582
triggers	insert
make insert and updates triggers to keep it up to-date then join on that

1001590
contains	elements
that contains the comments as elements with xml lang attributes identifying each one

1001590
xquery	xslt
you can then use xslt or xquery to create versioning in specific languages on-demand or at least enable the reader to do .so

1001590
xquery	xslt
that s harder to do if you use but if you use the above your xslt or xquery could actually generator another file with the comments in the target language

1001591
arrays	loops
i suspect you meant to do it in your outer loops - otherwise during one iterator of your outer loops you re increment i many time until you exceed the bounds of the arrays

1001609
qooxdoo	extjs	.when	ready
.when i have to building rich browser-side applications i d always switching to the big solutions extjs yui qooxdoo that offer a variety of ready to use widget

1001629
value	field
in php you can get the value of these field in the

1001638
value	field
i have a country field which has several countries value usa uk mex etc.. and i want to get the numbers of countries without duplicates if i have 100 usa and 2 uk and 1000 mex the result would be 3

1001710
oracle	mysql
as i make the full switching from windows to linux centos 5 i m in search of the best free gui sql client tool for mssql mysql oracle etc.

1001713
32-bit	64bit
i ve compared the machine.config and web-config files from the .net directory on the live and test and they seem the same compared the two iis setups also looked at the sql-server configuration and the only difference is that the live server is clustered on 64bit w2k3 while the test server is on 32-bit

1001716
implements	final
only you need to do a t b therefore your final operation after implements the three basic methods should be

1001721
serialization	unmarshalling	serialization	marshalling
one reason is that you can pass complex object c++ without needing to marshalling and unmarshalling serialization and de-serialization them

1001725
versioning	upgrade
if it s an older versioning then upgrade it to the newer versioning and things should work

1001732
gentoo	linux
p the question is - what systemd call does the php flock function-call boil down to on a gentoo linux systemd

1001751
background-image	width	background-image	height	background-repeat	background-image
in your stylesheet give them absolute positioning your png as a background-image with background-repeat set to no-repeat and an explicit height and width that s the exact size of your rounded corner

1001754
groovy	java
i m not 100 sure but i think that groovy maintains the java enforced-rule that you can t import classes with no package

1001790
required	checked
the good solution is usually too checked for all required assemblies during the installation of your software i suppose windows-installer has functions to checked for assemblies

1001809
selected	button
in this windows i want to be able to display 3 or 4 different views not at the same time which the user can selected the view via a button press

1001809
selected	button
now if the button to selected view 2 is on view 1

1001820
configuration	installation
you can now create the configuration file for your installation it s a simple text properties-file named portal-ext.properties and placed in the webapps root web-inf classes folder of your tomcat installation

1001827
.war	jar
a .war file is simply a jar file with a .war extension but what makes it work is how the contents is actually structured

1001847
gridview	radgrid
i have problems binding both a telerik radgrid and a plain vanilla asp.net gridview to the results of the following linq-to-entities query

1001847
duplicates	contains
in both cases the grid contains the correct numbers of rows but the data from only the first handful of rows is duplicates in all the other rows

1001855
vb.net	vba	vbscript	vb.net	vbscript	vba
i believe that the report are using something more along the line of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that

1001858
javascript	dom
i guess i can generator the dom elements within the javascript include but i was wondering how i could do it from the server side

1001862
vb.net	vba	basic	vba
it s vba visual basic for applications rather than vb.net .so it s not .net it s an embedded scripting-language

1001863
selected	button
the tabbarcontroller then serves to automatically switching between views for you .when the button is selected

1001871
progress-bar	progress
i need to know how to get inside that and measure its progress .so i can show a progress-bar

1001886
linq-to-entities	predicatebuilder
i discussed my solution to that in a question i started on msdn at predicatebuilder fails on nested predicates with linq-to-entities

1001906
emacs	vim
certainly vim and emacs will

1001910
python	java
what you probably did is selected a flavor such as java in the main toolbar and then click copy regex as python string

1001916
localization	translation
you re probably not going to do automatic localization but you can probably automate the process as far as gathering together the changed comments sending them off to be localized then incorporating the translation document into your documentation once they return from being translation

1001939
specifications	w3c
however i have not been able to locate any details in the w3c specifications on how that data really gets passed

1001953
setcontentview	oncreate
the next thing that you will need to do is let your activity know that you are using a custom layout by calling setcontentview in your activities oncreate

1001962
margins	padding
the padding doesn t look to be the issue it s the margins you have set

1001980
initializer	getter
as a rules i prefer to have a private field that i initializer and then expose only a getter to the client

1001988
value	field
since the first column in the sql table is an identity field you can provide any value you want - but you have to have a value there i don t think there s any way around this

1001998
scala	java
one important thing we don t yet have is an entry-level book suitable for scala as a first language rather than as a next step after java assuming some familiarity with the jvm apis and the syntax of java

1002004
keyboard	mouse
in this small class i have widget which are supposed to react to mouse or keyboard event

1002054
bufferedreader	printwriter
i m using bufferedreader and printwriter to go through each line of an input file make a change to some line and output the result

1002061
maven-central	archiva
it is setup .so the users hit the archiva repo and if it doesn t hvae it the archiva repo will then checked the maven-central repo the internal repo proxy the maven-central

1002061
maven-central	archiva
now if i want to add a new dependency to the archiva repository is there a cmd i can run to tell it to go fetch it from the maven-central repo or do i need to manually upload it

go back to basic and think in oo terms where your base-class contact contains the common elements of both employee and manager object

1002072
handler	service
.when you start stop a python cherrypy service compiled with py2exe this works fine .when i get a sys.exit call from my error handler cherrypy quits but the service remains hanging

1002087
knapsack-problem	bin-packing
it may well be that because your constraints are .so simple a knapsack packing algorithm is more suitable that the bin-packing just do a google for knapsack-problem

1002098
any	set
the problem that i m having is that .when the view shuts down any two-way binding to the properties in the viewmodel are immediately set to null and .so .when i display the viewmodel again all of the value are just set to null in the user-interface

1002098
contains	any
i assume this is because as part of the view closing down it dispose and clears any value in the controls it contains and since the binding are in-place they propagate down to the viewmodel as well

1002111
global-asax	web-config
then in global-asax on application_start i will checked the web-config for a flag that will indicate if the permissions need to be rebuilt

1002113
maven-central	archiva
if your dependencies they are not in maven-central you either have to manually upload it through the archiva web interface or you can use mvn deploy on the command-line

1002122
pygtk	pyqt
i have something very similar for pygtk not pyqt using the pulldom api

1002178
directory	folder
i d recommend you create a folder in that directory for your application and copy there

1002180
contains	elements
presuming main details contains elements which will have the named of the parameter as a key they should map to the object directly

1002180
contains	any
i would like to send the contents of the data as well as a query-string which could contains any numbers and types of key-value pairs to the controllers

1002181
protected	public
btw this is slightly misleading a base-class should have a destructor that is public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

1002181
base-class	inherited
the confusion is that inherited can be used for different purposes in c++ requiring different support from the base-class

1002189
installation	upgrade
.net 2.0 installation upgrade the scripting mapping to 2.0 and that doesn t work for all web-applications

1002192
constructor	object
create an object by calling the no-argument constructor of the class name1 and assign a reference to the newly-create object to the variables name2

1002203

i have a video-player that loads progressive flv video from a server and applies a reflection to it

1002377
silverlight	wpf
if staffing a silverlight wpf business .app project would you include a team of graphic designers

1002387
opensolaris	solaris
there are not any better ways of that i can think of to correlate opensolaris sources with solaris 10 binaries

1002387
opensolaris	solaris
the source tree for solaris 10 is a separate branch and features and bug fixed and sometimes back-ported to from the opensolaris branch to the solaris 10 branch

1002387
opensolaris	solaris
for example if opensolaris has gnome x.y and solaris 10 has gnome x.y then the sources and binaries for gnome components will be identical

1002387
opensolaris	solaris
if you are only concerned with the os .net part of solaris and opensolaris then the code is only loosely correlated in general

1002394
selected	button
.when i click on the second button it suddenly looks like both are selected

1002394
selected	button
click anywhere else within the dialog will cause the rendering to fix itself and only the selected button will be display

1002394
selected	button
i ve tried every trick i can think of to try to fix the problem invalidate dolayout requesting focus explicit setting the state of every button .when one is selected etc . but .so far the only thing i ve come up with that works is to make the dialog not be modal

1002397
value	field
numcols is defined as an identify field but in the c# code you are setting the value of the recording to 1

1002440
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	lua
ruby python lua php all can only run on a single core

1002440
perl	tcl
i d like to add perl which much like tcl has interpreter-based threads

1002441
mocking	stubs
while mocking is usually understood as allowing for isolation of a class under test this isn t the main points of a mock stubs are better for this

1002458
groovy	java
as groovy is based on the java virtual-machine you get support for true threads

1002465
value	field
note that the union clause returns unique value of the field .when you want it to return all the value you must use union all.

1002471
configuration	logging
my question is should i include a log4j.xml configuration in the jar file or have the client provide one if they want logging

1002471
configuration	logging
my feeling is to leave the log4j.xml configuration file out of the client jars since the apache jar files all come with log4j logging but sans log4j.xml

1002479
any	set
i have a reverse-proxy set up to forwarding certain request alone to be handled by the mochiweb server - any request url with mysite.com mochiweb gets routed to the mochiweb server

1002518
display	width
can we change the width of the datagrid column dynamically by click on the border of the column inorder to display the complete string which is too long to be display and needs to be scrolled

1002518
display	width
can we set the column width to take the length of data into consideration before display onto the datagrid

1002523
waitpid	fork
why not use fork and execute and simply don t call waitpid

1002540
pentaho	olap

is there any way with say perl or php that i can grab output from another process that output to the windows cmd shell

1002543
perl	php
i have a game server that output certain information for example say player finished tracking in 43s and i want to grab that line and use perl or php to send a request to a webserver to updates ranks on a webpage

1002543
perl	php
is there a way to grab that output pipe in perl or php

1002543
perl	php
let me clarify here i want to execute a seperate perl or php scripting that grabs output from the windows cmd shell and the output that is being display to the windows cmd shell is coming from a different process

1002544
value	field
not sure if this is the best way but you could redirect to a reload page and use the value from .post or get to reinput the existing field

1002544
value	field
then the .post or get will have all of the value the user filled in and the missing required field will already be blank .so you just loops through and load up the supplied info

1002553
value	field
of course .when they first load the page the value will be empty .so there is nothing there but if for .some rea.son it post back that username field will already contains entered information

1002579
radio-button	selected
how do you selected a radio-button in css

1002579
radio-button	selected
is there any other ways to selected a radio-button

1002581
binaries	install
i was hoping that a user who does not have gcc or msvc install could just run pysoundtouch14 s setup.py and it would detection the presence of our prebuilt binaries and just copy them to the right place libs python 2.5 site-packages for example. but that doesn t happen

1002584
directory	folder
i would probably write it to a folder contains within a directory of the application itself

1002585
stderr	stdout
redirecting stderr to stdout a couple of gotchas

1002585
command-line	cmd
flags to run cmd and terminate upon completion using cfexecute to execute command-line utilities

1002588
value	field
however .when i try and load an existing member s value for this field using the below which is part of a function that takes a row from the dataset --

1002593
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
.so you can use them very easily in the case of textfield but a bit more work is required for selected options checkbox and radio button

1002593
selected	button
for radio button selected options and checkedbox you instead have to checked the value to see if it corresponds with the entry you are currently outputting and printing selecteded selecteded

1002602
spring	guice
aop alliance is a set of interfaces that multiple frameworks implements see aop alliance motivations including both guice and spring

1002615
instance-variables	local-variables
to be specific these are instance-variables only named and not local-variables named

1002615
required	checked
the approach i usually follow for this sort of thing is to layer in an authentication structure in the applicationcontroller itself which can perform the required checked

1002618
icmp	udp
the udp socket will recvfrom any hosts sending to this one with correct ports unless you explicit connect in which case you can just write and read and get errors upon received icmp messages

1002621
jquery	.post
i checked to see if the .post value has been set otherwise you can show a default-value then use a bit of jquery to remove it .when the input has focus

1002623
silverlight	wpf
i originally came from the web side of development and am learning wpf silverlight at the moment

1002636
value	field
the valuemember properties tells the list what field to pull from .when setting the value properties

1002636
value	field
once you ve set the valuemember to countyid then .when the list is databound it will set all the list items value properties to their respect object countyid field

1002653
data-structures	dictionary
i m creating a hierarchy of composite dictionary data-structures in objective-c and am inheriting from nsmutabledictionary .so these classes can be used everywhere an nsdictionary nsmutabledictionary is called for

1002653
subclassing	inherited
since i strive to document the apis for my framework as completely as is rea.sonable i would like the documentation for my custom subclassing generator by doxygen to include descriptions of the most common methods of ns mutable dictionary .so users don t have to look at another page just to the methods that a particular custom dictionary inherited unchanged

1002662
derived-class	inherited
with non-virutal inherited this is less tricky than you might think - at the points where the cast is compiled the compiler knows the exact layout of the derived-class after all the compiler did the layout

1002662
base	zero
usually all that happens is a fixed offset which may be zero for one of the base classes is added subtract from the derived-class pointers

1002664
show	next
an idea would be to extends button to have a next button to show field play your storyboard for your showing animation then triggers the next button to do the same until you reach the last button where nextbutton null

1002665
value	field
does anyone know of a workaround for storing value outside of the range 1970-01-01 00 00 01 utc to 2038-01-09 03 14 07 utc in a mysql timestamp field

1002691
put	get
quite simply put code-behind is hard to unit-test but can and usually does include logic that doesn t get tested

1002698

if you are using a standards webserver it will never push anything to you - your client will have to periodically pull from it instead

1002719
web-deployment	web
i want to be able to add a button to all web application context menus that will setup iis for the website based on a shared archive from the web-deployment tool

1002745

1002752
directory	folder
iâ ve checked the â œbinâ directory in my project folder

1002759

1002770
derived-class	base-class
simulated dynamic-binding there are other uses of crtp is for .when the base-class thinks of itself as being polymorphism but clients only actually care about one particular derived-class

1002770
inlining	inline
note that if most widget belong to classes that your containers cannot possibly know about because they re in different libs for example then you can t possibly have inlining unless your dynamic linker can inline

1002773
semantics	keyword
the c# volatile keyword implements acquire and release semantics which implies a read memory barrier on read and a write memory barrier on write

1002775
contains	set
input set of points densely sampling of the boundary of a closed shape which can even contains holes

1002780

1002800
32-bit	64bit
64bit pe pe32+ and 32-bit 0

1002870
value	field
what i would like to do is .when i click to submit the form get jquery to grab the email field value and append it to the messages field

1002927
contains	elements
the only caviat to that is that if the vectors always contains the same elements ie you could work out a compile-time what is going to be execute at runtime

1002950
json	xml
if you don t need any of this then i would recommend against using xml and instead using something simpler like json

1002956
uinavigationcontroller	uiview
uiview s are not pushed to and popped from the uinavigationcontroller s stack

1002956
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
.so in your case if i understand correctly you simply have to overrides the viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods on what you call the parent page which is presumably handled by a uiviewcontroller and put in code to updates the appearance of the page to reflect the data just entered

1002971
textures	fbo
i m using an fbo to rendering my scene to a depth textures gl_depth_component

1002974
contains	elements
in ie6 and ie7 my design is affected because the divs that contains these elements become larger than they normally are and as a result elements under these are pushed further down somewhat breaking the design

1002974
font-size	height
i have the height defined for these elements and .when i decrease the font-size the elements begin to shrink to the correct size

1002983
hash	md5

margins	padding
make sure there that padding margins and border is 0

1002993
default	reset
the default three-hour session lifetime is reset each time you open the session see session_cache_expire .so the only way a session could timeout in the middle of a request is if a request takes three hours to process

1003128
directory	folder
should i place my .app cake and vendor folder as well as .htaccess and index.php files in the public_html directory

1003140
implements	extends
then extends observablecollection for each of your custom classes implements the itoggle interface

1003159
codeigniter	cakephp
in php cakephp and codeigniter do as well and i m sure most good frameworks do this as it falls under the category of common tasks that frameworks are supposed to abstract away

1003195
vba	vb6
microsoft wrote a whitepaper many years ago detailing some best practices for writing dlls to use with vb5 vb6 which of course would also apply to vba

1003235
contains	elements
using an elements s innerhtml is not reliable since it may contains other elementss and those elementss may have attributes that match what you re looking for - you don t want to remove them by mistake.

1003237
put	get
i was under the misguided impression up until a couple of years ago that i could get away with only synchronized the put and remove operations on a hashmap

1003245
sftp	ssh
rather than hack around with expect you might want to consider paramiko - it s a native ssh client for python which would greatly simplify the communication process particularly if you ever need to interact with the remote-server and it has support for things like sftp built-in

1003255
javascript	dom
however the meaning of this is only adjustable because javascript and the dom work in some very weird ways

1003255
semantics	keyword
however most uses of this make it a semantics appropriate keyword

1003262
put	get
i encourage you to put the repository definition in the pom this way any developer just grab a copy of the code and run maven to get it compiled without having to change things in his settings file

1003262
contains	elements
settings.xml file contains elements

1003269
any	set
required barely any effort - set up an account in sourceforge create a svn repo there and import your code

websphere	ibm
this is under jdk1.5 and ibm websphere 6.1 rad7

1003288
key-value	key
assuming upwards of 300 possible value on what would essentially be a table of key-value pairs where the column in question is the key

1003314
widget	button
guis are a great example as most of the work is in setting up the layout and there are generally lots of ways to make syntacticly valid c++ call that make no sense whatsoever to your underlying gui systemd eg trying to embed an entire dialog widget inside a button

1003315
key-value	key
on what would essentially be a table of key-value pairs where the column in question is the key

for turbogears and pylons the most suitable solution is sqlalchemy which is actually the most complete and rising orm for python

1003354
font-size	display
many web-applications display the tags and their popularity using a different font-size

1003356
dialogresult	messagebox
wpf supports messagebox albeit a slightly different versioning than winforms and you could put something together using wpf windows extends it by adding something similar to dialogresult

1003375
configuration	environment
to allow for configuration like clustered environment a test for a

1003392
postgresql	mysql
the sqlite concat is the same as postgresql || and not mysql or mssql concat

i ve set up all my async object to inherited from a class and have the form and all the callback delegation provided to the constructor of the async object in my dal

1003423
pylons	django	turbogears	django	turbogears	pylons
i prefer to use django myself but given your needs i d go with pylons or turbogears rather then shoe-horning a different orm into the systemd

1003443
implements	extends
it checked types to see if they implements or extends specific interfaces base classes inotifypropertychanged incc dependencyobject etc and .so doesn t care if the interface is implementss explicit

1003447
linux	unix
.when everyone in the building used unix machines to do everything the test .app and gui worked just fine but recently everyone got newer faster linux x86 machines

1003459

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	session-cookies	cookies
in firefox safari or google-chrome this works fine but in ie 8 don t have an earlier versioning of ie to test and msft won t let me uninstaller ie 8 and have a working ie 7 the only cookies it sees are the session-cookies not any of the persistent cookies the ones found in the temporary internet files

1003524
32-bit	64bit
the integration loads some third party 32-bit drivers and it is not possible to load a 32-bit dll in a 64bit process

1003524
32-bit	64bit
it always runs the 64bit versioning from c windowss system32 mstsc.exe regardless of how i start it run windows 32-bit cmd windowss etc

1003524
32-bit	64bit
i ve done some further investigation with process monitor and it seems that the 32-bit versioning of mstsc does start first but then this creates a second 64bit process and the 32-bit versioninging closes

1003528
directory	folder
in c# i d loops over the directory get the list of files in each folder then loops over them to run the commandlines

note that if it were as simple as just a textbox i wouldn t worry about it but the datatemplate actually contains a stackpanel l with a numbers of other elements in it

1003747
alpha	rgba
given that textures a and b are rgb images then perhaps you can make one of them into an rgba image and rendering the mask in the alpha channel of one image

1003751
httpserver	webserver
i also still don t understand and would love to be educated why httpserver plugins are necessary and we can t have a php webserver agnostic solution

1003752
low-level	hardware
i think as you go closer to hardware device drivers kernel etc one wants to use as low-level language as possible

1003774
switching	screens
however this approach doesn t handle the device lost event happening due to lock screens ctrl+alt+delete remote-desktop connections user switching or similar

1003786
callback	methods
insert some breakpoints to see how far the connection gets through the nsurlconnectiondelegate callback methods before it bombs

1003818
toolchain	gcov
if you are using the gcc toolchain gcov is going to get you source functional and branch coverage statistics

1003818
lcov	gcov
however if you really want to hit it out of the park with pretty report using gcov in conjunction with lcov is the way to go

1003818
lcov	gcov
another approach is doing the gcov emit on windows and doing the lcov .post process on linux where it will surely work out of the box

1003845
union-all	union
there won t be recording for the same id in the other table with the same date_this_status value can be mitigated by using union instead of union-all

1003883
selected	textbox	children	nodes
if you expand either the one or two parent nodes and click one of the children the child that was selected does not show up as selected after the focus methods is called on the textbox

1003895
contains	any
the objective of the query is to recurse through parent child relationships of product category and return the numbers of product under each category this include any product contains in children category

1003895
contains	any
it s not account for product that may be contains within any of its children

1003896
deployment	install
the downside of this approach is that it takes two cmd instead of one to install the gem but this is largely mitigated in qa and production environment since we use capistrano for deployment

1003898
proxy-server	apache
if you still want to give it a try read this article using apache as a proxy-server

1003903
selected	button	selected	cell
i also set up the combobox to disappear .when it s not in use much in the same way as the data validation dropdown button only appears .when you selected the relevant cell

1003903
selected	cell
i don t want the users to edit the value in the linked cell .so i make sure the linked cell is locked whenever the combobox is not selected

1003903
selected	button	selected	cell
i could make sure that the combobox covers up the linked cell whenever it is selected but sometimes that means having a very large annoying combo box with a very tiny dropdown button on its right side

1003921
expression	evaluation
to increase the performance of repeated string concatenation a java compiler may use the stringbuffer class or a similar technique to reduce the numbers of intermediate string object that are created by evaluation of an expression

more specifically create a release branch and then .when you are ready to deploy simply merge your changes into the release branch ssh to the server and git-pull

1004041
keyboard	mouse
between hotkeys shortcuts and keyboard navigation a user rarely needs to use the mouse

1004041

debugging	trace
we d like to set facelets.development to false to suppress stack trace in non-development environment but we d like to have it set to true in dev for debugging

1004140
environment	building
our deployment process dictates one codeigniter building that is migrate through the environment up to production .so we can t use an .approach that required rebuildinging the .app rewriting web.xml for each environment

1004150
triggers	insert
write a triggers that runs after insert .so you have access to the generator id key-value

1004174

the easiest fix may be to checked to see whether the versioning of tomcat you are using has this error in any other versioninging you may just need to upgrade revert tomcat

1004295
entity-framework	nhibernate
however nhibernate seems to hold the largest mindshare while the entity-framework is the new hotness from microsoft

also if your remote webserver is accessible by ssh you could learn a screens oriented text-editor such as the vi editor and edit the source files on the server

1004297
listbox	textbox
in my own .app i m not actually putting textbox inside of a listbox

1004297

am i using the wrong types or combinations of types in database and or hibernate java to maintain a null value for a numeric field

1004306
instances	destroy
.when you set this to true then a release of the ccomptr that holds the dte object doesn t destroy the instances

1004322
sharp-architecture	nhibernate
you should have a look at sharp-architecture an asp.net-mvc application framework which uses nhibernate

1004325
getchar	gets
getchar gets a single character from the standards input which in this case is the keyboard buffering

1004328

1004369
background-color	height
.so i will just use a background-color on the wrapper instead .so its not noticeable that they have different height

1004371
linked-list	tree	linked-list	nodes
for instances .when representing a graphing tree or linked-list the nodes usually have references to other nodes that they are linked connect to

1004398
base-class	inherited
i d rather recommend not using masterpages for this master pages by design are for visual inherited not code inherited if you wish to make some special types of pages that checked for the the browser ability to use cookies you can have a new base-class for these pages

1004398
base-class	inherited
and add your logic to this class then whenever you need to make a new page with this behavior you inherited from this base-class

1004417
project-management	project
even with the plugins you still had to go into vss to create project and do .some project-management stuff .so you still had to know how to use the .source control tools outside of the ide

1004432
versioning	upgrade
one way to work around this could be to create an intermediate dummy rpm versioning n+1 of the old package which contains no files upgrade to that and then updates to your final new package

1004434
python	tcl
the company i work for has quite a bit of existing tcl code but some of them want to start using python

many other common uses can be satisfied with some combinations of the operators itertools and functools modules

1004513
python	tcl
edit in re to comment python tcl interpreter is not aware of other install tcl components

1004513
python	tcl
you can deal with that by adding extensions in the usual way to the tcl python actually uses

1004525
required	checked
even though it is possible to checked for the hash value first it required two transactional per row first for selected the hash from destination table then perform the insert

1004526
transactional	audit-trail
you just need to make sure your checkeded are not too expensive in the load that apply to the servers and that you don t checked data that might be part of open replication transactional .so might be expected to be different at that moment hence checkeded the audit-trail a few minutes back in time instead of now in my example otherwise you ll get too many false alarms

1004539
constructor	object
for unit-testing purposes i m trying to write a mock object of a class with no constructor

1004543
constructor	private
if the class has only private constructor then no it can t

1004597
python	c++
the server backend on the ultima online 2 project at origin in the late 90 s was mostly python over a c++ server infrastructure and the late tablua rasa game from ncsoft with most of the same dev team had the same architecture

1004597
python	c++
.when you do the inevitable optimization of moving some high performance systemd from python to c++ then pushing data back and forth across language boundaries and calling functions across language boundaries becomes an issue

1004642
selection	cell
if i have a custom uitableviewcell that doesn t use the textlabel built-in to the cell but instead does its own drawing how can i change the appearance of the contentview on selection like it does automatically for the default text customizable by setting the selectedtextcolor

1004646
constructor	private
if there are only private constructor you can still use reflection inorder to be able to access them from outside that class

1004652
delphi	basic	delphi	c++
it s delphi code but in c++ the basic idea is exactly the same

1004672
grouping	sorting
updates i need to do more testing on it but it appears my nasty query works out better if i don t do the grouping and sorting in the db but do it in ruby afterwards

1004697

then you can do this to get the value of the field

1004771
value	field
or do this to set the value of the field

1004780
implements	extends
if you actually have access to the source code of the class you could implements an inner class which allows you to extends it although if you could do that you could just make one of the constructor package-private as well

1004790
attributes	properties
it does not pay much attention to the serialization attributes but mostly just serialization the public read write properties of public classes which have a default-constructor

1004793

i am currently using nunit and rhino-mocks and am trying to work out how this methods has to be refactored to be testable well and whether something like this should be tested

1004886
jquery	.post
that s the jquery .post methods making a .post request to the current page i m guessing here i m assuming it just .post to the current page if that parameter is an empty string with the contents of variables messages being passed as a parameter named messages

1004905
constructor	object
simply inject the factory into the constructor of the class contains this methods and use it as a properties within this methods to create the proper object

1004916
union-all	union
you should use union-all instead of union to save the cost of duplicates checked

1004921
32-bit	64bit
every executable on the systemd is compiled either as a 32-bit or as a 64bit executable

1004921
32-bit	64bit
if you have a 64bit executable then it doesn t matter how you invoke it from a 32-bit cmd windows from run menu or from another 32-bit program

1004921
32-bit	64bit
updates eran points out that invoking 32-bit mstsc.exe directly does not solve the problem because mstsc detection that it is running on a 64bit systemd and reinvokes the 64bit versioning of itself

1004924
progress-bar	progress
the 2nd progress-bar gauges progress on the zipfile

1004975
subtract	add
the first one compiles fine because you can subtract pointers in c++ but not add pointers

1004981
key-events	keyrelease
the robot class has both keypress and keyrelease methods which can be used to cause key-events on a machine

1005004
put	get
we do this where i work ie put interface in one package and implementation in another and the main advantage we get out of this is we can easily swap between implementation

1005048
coalesce	isnull
just to clarify things since there seems to be a lot of discussion about coalesce isnull will still return null if no rows match try this query you can copy-and-paste into sql-server directly as-is

1005057
export	report
the expression would of course convert the value to text which maybe problematic .when you export the report to excel

1005058

my current thought is that at startup i should rendering 6 paths 1 for each color piece i have and overlay them with the png and then store an image of these pieces and then just redraw the pieces each time i need them

1005216
video-player	flv
any playback control for a video needs to be handled by a swf-based video-player such as the jw flv player

1005225
click	mouse
you could use a tool like autohotkeys to create a recorded scripting mouse click or key presses and then assign it a hotkeys that will play it back .when pressed.

1005238
turbogears	pylons
i d go with werkzeug personally as the framework most suitable for highly complex project requiring ridiculous amounts of flexibility and power -- though pylons and turbogears 2 on top of it may be acceptable as a fallback if the team just doesn t have the web .app experience and skill it takes to make truly beautiful music with a flexible framework such as werkzeug

1005238
json	xml	javascript-framework	dojo
last but not least i d strongly lobby for dojo for the presentation layer on the client -- a rich and strongly structured javascript-framework offering superbly designed functionality for local data hosts access c optimized for the best that each of several browsers and plugins such as gears can offer as well as advanced user-interface functionality seems likeliest to lighten the heavy development burden on the back-end team in fact i d strongly recommend looking at offering an essentially restful interface on the server side and delegation all presentation work to dojo on the client -- see this site for more except i d be thinking of json rather than xml as the preferred interchange format

1005240
nsmutablearray	nsarray
assuming you figure out why getjsonasarray is not returning an nsarray you can convert an nsarray to an nsmutablearray with

1005279

if in the same new work add the sharepoint site to your trusted sites or local intranet in internet options and in the trusted sites security custom level user authentication section selected the option automatically login with the current user named and passwd

1005291
initializer	getter
i m not sure what you mean by initializer but if you re worried about the running time of the getter you can think of caching the response

1005297
getter	setter
i don t have my copy of clr via c# here with me but getter and setter of properties are just methods on the class with special decoration

1005316
triggers	insert

launchd	daemons
most likely the .app will end up running in the background .so you ll need to mark it as a windows service unix daemons or mac launchd .application

1005333
configuration	installation
you may have to rely on the install to write a configuration file entry with the actual installation path which you ll have to load up at startup

1005343
value	field
you ll have to be very careful .when you use reflection to set properties or field on the value-type though - without that care you ll end up creating a copy changing the value on that copy and then throw it away

1005358
required	checked
from here you can overrides the onauthorization methods where you can checked if the user has completed your required configuration step and set the filtercontext.result accordingly

compact-framework	.net
this is all running .net compact-framework 2.0 under windows-ce 5.0

1005414
required	checked
it is unlikely that the xml parsing will be any kind of bottleneck but if it is consider parsing the xml directly using simple pattern checked as opposed to a full-on compliant parsing--of course this will required the xml to be simple in format and laid out in line-by-line fashion

1005416
configuration	environment
my first thought is to add .something in the respective environment.rb files for each one .so configuration environment beta.rb would contains

1005416
configuration	environment
and configuration environment staging.rb would contains

1005418
capacity	storage
im running a file hosts thats grown beyond the capacity of a single server and i need to implements multiple server storage of files

that way the scrollbar updates as the user typess and if they types in an invalid value the scrollbar stays put and they ll get an error .when they move to whatever the next stage is

1005453
contains	any
since a distributedmap does not contains any roots where shared state would overlap with another instances each instances would be separate from one another meaning you can make as many independent distributedmaps as you like

1005456
directory	folder
one methods that required no programmatic setup and is quite secure is to mount a folder from the other server and use php to save to that directory like you would normally

1005503
getter	setter
or how to write setter and getter methods for these arrays

1005505
hash	md5
in this case using an md5 hash of the page content as the etag will be a lot easier

1005510
firebird	oracle	firebird	mysql	oracle	mysql
at this time it looks like firebird mssql compact mssql mysql oracle sqlite and sybaseanywhere have implementation for itablemetadata .so it s only possible with one of these unless you make your own implementation

1005774
value	field	getter	setter
later i figured out i can use strings in my applicaiton which makes it easier to pass around nulls as the actual domain field are nullable most of the time and only change those field getter and setter to use getdomainvalue index and setdomainvalue index value methods that will translation between the key and value to from the underlying feature object

1005891
double	int
it is present there .so the compiler decides to call b f int converting double to int

1005891
double	int
now b class has two overloaded functions for int and for double

1005897
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
you should use a itemscontrol defined its itemspanel as a stackpanel and its itemtemplate as a usercontrolline

1005898
implements	abstract
.when overridess a non-virtual methods in java use of the overrides annotations is recommended but what if i implements an abstract methods

1005902
macros	let
then paste all this in words and a simple vb macros will let you generator the same code as you could do in 2

1005911
subclassing	superclass
i tend to prefer the use of overrides in this case .so that the methods gets flagged in the subclassing if the superclass changes either removing the methods altogether or changing its signature etc.

1005932
environment	building
to investigate we tried to create a clean building environment in a virtual-machine vbox then we run the building there

1005945
code-coverage	gcov
on a relatively different note i had used a code-coverage tool that also generator html code views from gcov coverage information

1005952
if-statement	loops
i ll be grabbing the information from an oracle fwiw hence the format above and there will be hundreds maybe thousands of recording .so my lame attempt to do all .sorts of loops and if-statement would take forever to run

1005986
duplicates	elements
the intention should rather be specified in the documentation of the methods which should detail whether the collections s iterator will return elements in any particular order and whether duplicates elements will appear

1006047
deployment	install
if this setting is required on test machines perhaps a deployment scripting could modify the .app during the install for those servers

1006055
filtering	sorting
there is a very good libs called glazedlists that makes it a lot simpler to work with lists and tables including column sorting and row filtering

1006057
output	mode
1. .when i checked the output of my file dump i realized since i am opening file in binrary mode i should not be using printf but i should use fwrite

1006058
callback	methods
i am worried about calling the callback methods as the client may close his application but i handled it using the try-catch decrease the timeout and send the broadcasting in parallels .so is that sufficient

1006072
csv	xml
key-value pairs should be used for one-dimensional data csv for two-dimensional data xml for hierarchical-data and a db for anything more complex

1006080
logout	login
inorder to do that you need to create and mantain a list of all connect clients the general practice to fo this is creating login and logout methods to create and manage a list of object representing your clients incuding their callbackcontext

1006080
callback	methods
this methods could also act as a keep-alive or hear-beat methods if this isn t it s purpose by design by adding the possiblity to remove clients from your list if the service cannot send the callback to them

1006086
user-controls	ascx
the web specific behavior comes with a couple of user-controls marked up inside ascx templates user-controls

1006086
user-controls	ascx
theres also always the other option of rewriting the ascx controls into custom-controls but just don t have the resources to consider it at the moment and we ve got no expertise in doing that and they work fine as user-controls

1006089
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
another way of thinking about it is sudoku where each quad column and row contains the set of 1-9 making any of the 81 data points related directly to any other data points it shared a row column or quad with but not to any data points

1006089
row	col
it s important that these relationships be grouping semantics in the html .so that should .someone be using a screens reader or non-traditional browser they can know where they are in the table at any given points ie you are in quad 1 super col 1 column 4 super row 1 row 1

1006091

1006123
hide	show
i have the below scripting to hide the content of one div and show another

1006163
environment	building
a simple set cmd to overrides the environment variables with the correct ones fixed the building

1006225
code-coverage	coverage.py
for the code-coverage alone you could use coverage.py

1006232
httpd.conf	hosts
you need to enable it in httpd.conf and in all virtual hosts since directives are not inherited

1006235
virtual-machine	vmware
i currently use a vmware virtual-machine windows-xp to debugging my .net winforms applications under 120dpi

1006245
callback	methods
alternatively you can wrap your binding into a function and have that execute as a callback to the methods that updates your table data for instances

1006253

ver_suite_smallbusiness microsoft small business server was once install on the systemd but may have been upgrade to another versioning of windows

1006315
lightbox	jquery
try calling any javascript lightbox from flash using jquery

1006315
lightbox	jquery
or you could ports flashlightboxinjector start lightbox from flash a prototypejs class to the jquery framework without too much trouble if your a somewhat confident in writing javascript

1006322
constructor	object
now i am assuming you are comparing against the case where the created object creates its own encapsulated object most likely in its constructor

1006338
naming-conventions	conventions
for the interface part see the naming-conventions section of the java coding conventions document

1006341
value	field
thanks for the answers i was trying to do something like this i am still not sure that .tostring would be the best way to compare to value of a field

1006390
exception-handling	try-catch
upd whtat is most strange - if i surround it with a try-catch block it still fails without exception-handling

1006393
json	xml
json and xml is a choice

1006393
json	xml
json and ajax are distinct and largely unrelated although ajax often uses json it can just easily use xml html or plain text

1006393
json	xml
json has a smaller payload than equivalent xml

1006393
json	xml
json is easier to deal with in javascript compare eval ing a json object to walking an xml fragment

1006397
json	xml
ajax stands for asynchronous javascript and xml but .when using json you could say that you re using ajaj asynchronous javascript and json

1006400
webserver	nginx
i have nginx as my front-end webserver listening on ports 80

1006400
webserver	nginx
and certain request i ve set up nginx to reverse-proxy it to a mochiweb based webserver that i ve written listening on ports 8000

1006402
any	set
is the path to any interpreter set correctly

1006414
contains	elements
use regex.replace against the phone-number after pulling the value of the phone-number from the value of the attributes or elements that contains it

1006417
gethashcode	equals
the problem that i have is that both functions throw the compiler warning function gethashcode or equals shadow an overridable methods in the base-class object

1006420
constructor	private	any	set
however this is not necessarily true - i know that the latest versioning of the spring di framework in java for example let you annotations private field with autowired and the dependency will be set via reflection without you needing to expose the dependency through any of the classes public methods constructor

1006420
constructor	object
i ve always felt that object should be fully valid after construction such that anything they need inorder to perform their role be in a valid state should be supplied through the constructor anyway

1006420
constructor	object
if you have an object that required a collaborator to work it seems fine to me that the constructor publically advertises this requirement and ensures it is fulfilled .when a new instances of the class is created

1006420
constructor	object
ideally .when dealing with object you interact with them through an interface anyway and the more you do this and have dependencies wired through di the less you actually have to deal with constructor yourself

1006425
for-loop	arrays
if you re looping through an arrays it shouldn t matter - the enhanced for-loop uses arrays accesses anyway

1006433
required	checked
to checked the required libs use ldd

1006433
python	perl
another possibility is if your program is a scripting shell perl python or other text-based program

1006438
contains	any
an object list can contains any object visual or not but that gives you an added overhead of sorting out which items are which - better to have related lists if you want multiple dynamic controls on similar panels for instances

1006446
selected	button
if you hold down shift while right-clicking on the pinned application and selected properties you can see the change icons button for the shortcut

1006468
put	get
with this cmd i can get the address of this function and can put breakpoints

1006474
html.dropdownlistfor	dropdownlistfor
it would be better if it was possible to explicit set the value of the default item in the dropdownlistfor but that is not possible in the html.dropdownlistfor

1006505
selected	cell
create uitabledatasource store 4 strings in an arrays and .when uitableview request cell for selected row return one of the 4 strings using random function

1006513
contains	any
controllers shouldn t contains any business-logic

1006516
value	field
but .when i go ahead and follow the same format to try to insert a new field it continue to pull up empty value .when i m positive something should be there

1006537
boolean	int
i wanted to convert the typex to int or boolean and this operation is one common thing that i am doing in lots of places in the code

1006554
put	get
rather if they find some deficiency in what you have put out there you are likely to get helpful bug report or even patches

1006568
gettext	poedit
you should use gettext and poedit

1006569
show	next
can anyone tell me how can i display an image next to the cursor like vista .when dragging a file to folder it show a copy to... tooltip

1006573
bison	yacc	lexer	lex
if your xml structure is very simple you can consider building a simple lexer scanner based on lex yacc flex bison

1006595
contains	any
probably one of your handlermod modules does not contains any tags variables

1006614
value	field
i am trying to use the except methods on a linq result set using a custom implementation if iequalitycomparer to exclude certain results based on the value of a single field from the result set

1006615
websphere	ibm
look at the ibm redbooks site maybe websphere application-server network deployment v6 high availability solutions

updating	updates
by manually handling the updates i hope to be able to read user settings into memory before updating then write them back out after the updates is completed

1006655
primitive	int
are java primitive int int atomicity at all for that matter

1006655
32-bit	16-bit
on a machine where a 32-bit value had to be accessed as four separate bytes or even two 16-bit words there would be a probability that watcher would catch the shared int in an inconsistent half-updated state and detection the value decreasing rather than increasing

1006659
contains	any
translation that means that you can t rely on them containss any particular thing -- they will just contains whatever random garbage was already in memory at that location which could be different from run to run

1006698
32-bit	64bit
some implementation may find it convenient to divide a single write action on a 64bit long or double value into two write actions on adjacent 32-bit value

1006702
base-class	inherited
my unit test was created in 2008 but it inherited from a base-class built-in vs 2005

1006708
setinterval	settimeout
any animation is going to rely on settimeout setinterval and the page won t wait for those to complete before leaving

1006717
value	field
inorder to shorten the string in the constants pool i would presume that one would have to alter the value of the length field to reflect the length of the string itself

1006725
32-bit	64bit
keep in mind that 64bit int have alignment restrictions at least as great as 32-bit int on all platform

1006725
32-bit	64bit
therefore it s perfectly safe to cast a pointers to a 64bit int as a pointers to a 32-bit

1006731
constructor	object
the object datacontext for linq does not have an empty constructor

1006735
access-control	impersonation
this is likely to break if doing impersonation under windows-authentication to have the client s identity used for access-control to filesystems content

1006764
double	int
a read or write from int or any smaller types should be atomicity but as robert noted longs and double may or may not depending on the implementation

1006776

1006840
versioning	packaging
the two could possibly differ as on the web you d need to keep some versioning information in the url that you don t need .when packaging a single release

1006840
publishing	release
the trick here is to publishing the documentation always under a proper release identifier in the url on the filesystems and use a link or a redirect to make sure that the current documentation on the webserver points to the current release

1006849
contains	elements
in c++ arrays and vectors are always contains fixed-size elements

1006934
put	get
in html-editor if i put a in i automatically get content-assist for javascript in the referenced file

1006936
constructor	object
i don t do enough php to know if this is possible but could you not pass a delegation callback in to the constructor of the object

1006940
display	height
however you probably need to adjust the row height .when you want to display images since the rows won t adjust automatically to their content

1006941
contains	set
i ve also created another user-controls which contains only a flow layout panels with the flow directions set to top down

1006944
export	report
i m having an issue where i can view my report in an asp.net environment and can even export them but as soon as i got printing them i get the following javascript error

1006950
display	height
if you have variblerowheight then .when you go to edit a cell make sure all cell in the row are the same height and you may also have to invalidate the size and display

1006951
selected	button	selected	listbox
the selected items from one listbox lst1 should be populate in another listbox lst2 onclientclick of add button and accordingly the third listbox lst3 needs to be populate with value from db as per the selected value in lst2

1006957
eclipse-plugin	aptana
imo aptana is the best eclipse-plugin for javascript editing

xsd	xml
i m trying to validation the following xml against a xsd schema using ruby

1007456
attributes	properties	default-value	default
also to make your properties look the same as the default ones you can add description or default-value attributes

1007459
memcached	apc
you would probably be better off storing the object in memory with memcached or apc and don t forget that you may have issues with locks on the file is several people are hitting the site at once

1007483
communication	messages
the entities communication with each other by sending messages between each other

1007516
compact-framework	.net
i have coded my own tiny static dal class for .net compact-framework and local sql-server that does just what i need

1007518
callback	methods
i donâ t know the methods youâ re using for calling as functions but if itâ s synchronous can return data to javascript without using callback or something then the as function will finish before javascript function and before page reload

1007520
instances	private
i m trying to declare a resource in a wpf user-controls and i d like the resource to be an instances of a private inner class

1007533
buffering	streaming
i don t see you writing a newline foo doesn t fill the buffering and since the streaming isn t closed does it see an eof

1007539
javascript	dom
i am trying to parsing a xml file that i have using javascript dom

1007551
msbuild	nant
i per.sonally got sick of that .so i went and looked into nant and msbuild

1007571
protected	public
.when i tried using the -p option with some c++ code however it usually returns the access-specifier private public protected etc which isn t terribly handy

1007578
xsd	xml
great idea and once you get used to it it s good however if you have an xsd for your input xml file i d sooner recommend you use jaxb

1007579
contains	elements
the actual statement in the javadoc is this class offers constants time performance for the basic operations add remove contains and size assuming the hash-function disperses the elements properly among the buckets .

1007600
any	set
if you run set without any other arguments you will see the environment variables that are set

1007607
accessor	ivar
if i need to overrides an accessor can i still access that ivar that will be definedd at runtime or do i have to defined an actual ivar that the runtime will then use

1007629
cakephp	symfony
therefore i ve narrowed it down to cakephp or symfony

1007646
updating	updates
this is assuming that your application or whoever is updating the table is smart enough to updates the clob field only .when there has been a change made to the clob field and not every time your table is updatess

1007669
arguments	default
it has as a default arguments a default construct object of types t this is the default-constructor being called in your output

1007670
sql-server	oracle
because of this abstraction you can use oledb providers for sql-server oracle xml access or comma delimited text files as your backing store if you wish and the only change you need to make to your code is the connection-string

1007672
versioning	upgrade
i did have some issues with the lack of any sort of discernable upgrade path between versioning though

1007672
cakephp	symfony
i can t speak for symfony but i believe it s more heavyweight than cakephp

1007673
webforms	asp.net
i m using asp.net webforms and lots of javascript jquery

1007691
constructor	object
i looked at the internals of observablecollections and it uses a list as it s storage collections object i used reflector and saw this in the constructor

1007696
derived-class	base-class
and the compiler can figure this all out because it understands implicit that a derived-class can be stored in a reference to a base-class

1007698
double	int
in c# value-type like int double byte and struct are pass-by-value by default

1007708
firefox	opera
.so firefox 3.5 and opera are your best bet

1007709
versioning	migrate
.when you use ruby-on-rails migrations a table called schema_migrations is automatically created which keeps tracking of what migrations have been applied by storing the versioning numbers of each migration this is the numbers that prefaces the migration named in the file named ie db migrate _20090617111204__migration.rb

1007709
versioning	migrate
their versioning is not contains in the table will be run for this reason changing a migration that s already been execute will have no effect .when running db migrate

1007711
environment	building
bids is the sole environment to building ssis package

1007724
postgresql	oracle
i m looking for a tool to export data from a postgresql db to an oracle data-warehouse

1007727
contains	elements
in addition your outer hotel elements containss a room elements which must contains a hotel elements creating an infinite-loop

1007729
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
just coming back to the basic that inherited is for specialising behavior for different types of derived object the draw function declare in a base-class called shape would produce different output for a derived-class square compared to a derived-class circle

1007736
ssas	ssis
bids is just visual-studio with the vspackages for ssis ssrs and ssas development

1007751
buffering	streaming
is it a buffering streaming

1007767
expression-blend	designer
this means that the designer using expression-blend cannot edit design assets - and the designer developer workflow is broken

1007773
postgresql	oracle
you can create a database link from oracle to postgresql this is called heterogeneous connect

1007773
postgresql	oracle
this makes it possible to selected data from postgresql with a selected statement in oracle

1007799
any	set
it returns 0 on success or -1 with errno set on error in which case any numbers of bytes might have been copy-paste

1007811
value	field
i have a field in my database-table that use to store an enumerator value

1007817
ref	out
see here oracle - how to have an out ref cursor parameter in a stored procedure

1007819
any	set
without relying on hardcode pixels value or dpi settings and the like how can i set the height of the list and the surrounding composite to a fixed numbers of rows say 3 without any added inner margins

1007835
databound	gridview	sqldatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	databound
if you are hooking up a databound elements to a datasource a gridview or combobox to a sqldatasource make sure the datasource is assign to one of your connection strings

1007862
.net	wcf
wcf that shipped in .net 3.5 include good rest capability and tools

1007866
rubymine	textmate
it s not quite as nice as rubymine but it has built-in svn support and similar templates to textmate

1007870
gedit	vim
personally unless it is java development convoluted in itself i stay away from traditional ides and use a modular solution of vim gedit makefile and other automations

1007870
gedit	gnome
gedit on linux gnome is a great compromise

1007881
xsd	xml
the xml and xsd files are stored on disk and are being read from there

1007881
xsd	xml
in the actual .app the xml file would be in memory already as an xmldocument object and the xsd would be read from an internal webserver.

1007881
xsd	xml
.when running the above code with the xml and xsd files defined above i get this output

1007881
xsd	xml
the actual xml file is much larger as well as the xsd but it fails at the very beginning .so i have reduced the problem to almost nothing

1007883
.net	wcf
rest capabilities are include and supported in the wcf that is part of the current .net v3.5

1007883
.net	wcf
the rest starter kit is a bunch of add-on stuff to wcf for .net 3.5

1007908
firefox	safari
the css code works just fine in safari 3 on mac and windows but not in firefox 3 windows

1007908
firefox	safari
i m running the django dev webserver and i can see the css file being called in the console .when in safari but not .when using firefox

1007914
checkbox	button
i like to keep all advanced options hidden under a more less button or advanced mode checkbox depending on the context and application

1007914
show	next
in terms of action availability though like a wizard featuring next previous button i always show them and enable disable them according to what functionality is possible

1007915
.mov	m4a
input #0 .mov mp4 m4a 3gp 3g2 mj2 from h path to file..mov

in the small excerpt of xml xsd you are currently testing

1007958
split-button	contextmenu
i m trying to create a split-button control that uses a contextmenu to display its items

1007958
contextmenu	icons	split-button	contextmenu
i have a part_dropdowninitiator that is the little icons the user click on to bring up the contextmenu for the split-button to show its items

1007958
split-button	contextmenu
the problem is that i m trying to setup a default contextmenu inside of the split-button s templates or styles this way the user of the control doesn t have to do it themselves

1007958
split-button	contextmenu
now i d like to add an items and itemssource properties to the split-button that the contextmenu within the split-button s templates can bind to it

1007967
instance-variables	ivar
since instance-variables themselves can only be synthesized in the modern runtime and must be declare in the interface under 32-bit or pre-leopard it s safest most portable to also declare the ivar

1007967
accessor	ivar
if initializing and modifying an ivar should act the same use the properties accessor for both

1007967
accessor	ivar
if i need to overrides an accessor can i still access that ivar that will be definedd at runtime or do i have to defined an actual ivar that the runtime will then use

1007975
double	int
2 32 + 1 should be recognized as double even though it looks like int

1008006
rich-internet-application	ria
you are buildinging an integrated rich-internet-application ria with flex and ajax portions.although you could building the integration yourself using externalinterface you might find it faster to start with the fabridge

1008027
put	get
you shouldn t put extra code in your settranslate since it won t get called

1008067
macros	vba
anyone know of a vba macros that will take care of this for me

1008068
cvs	git
i d use a git cvs subversion etc

1008083
value	field
the key field will be compared by value for an equality test instead of comparing the references to the two anonymous types

1008103
firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox and safari but .when i tested it in ie7 it errors

1008113
while-loop	for-loop
here is the output .when i run the scripting with jim s while-loop replacing the for-loop

1008120
order	add
you go to make a lookup or add an entry but use win7 s sort order

1008120
sql-server	mysql
edit if you re using a production database like sql-server or mysql they handle this all for you behind the scenes .so don t worry if you re just querying these databases

1008144
floor	ceil
there s really no need to multiplying floor ceil anything the math.random function gives value which is larger than or equals to 0 and less than 1

1008173
textmate	vim
however i do occasionally use textmate or vim with rails.vim

1008183
32-bit	64bit	double	int
that is you can convert an int to a double but converting a pointers to an int to a pointers to double would make the compiler believe that there are 8 bytes of memory at the pointed address while in fact only 4 bytes are present assuming 32 or 64bit architecture with 32-bit int and 64bit double

1008191
centering	fixed
in search of the holy grails is a great article from ala that explains the best methods of setting up a 3 column layout with fluid centering fixed sides and correctly source-ordered elements

1008221
contains	any
hi is possible to change the cell that contains specific value to another without the use of looping or extra code is there any built-in function in excel

1008230
constructor	private
camel-case pascal-case etc should be used for what elements constructor private functions public functions

1008237
qwidget	qtabbar
this is somewhat similar to how qt provides a qtabwidget class that inherited qwidget but has a private qtabbar that it uses internally

1008237
protected	public
one significant difference is that it provides a protected tabbar accessor rather than a public one

1008238
cakephp	symfony	zend-framework	symfony	zend-framework	cakephp
i ve worked extensively with zend-framework and symfony and i ve had a brief look at cakephp

1008238
cakephp	symfony
also remember that if you like some of the tools in zf you ll be able to use these in symfony and probably also cakephp project alongside symfony cakephp

1008239
32-bit	x86
the program files x86 directory is where 32-bit programs are install

1008239
32-bit	x86
.when a 32-bit application is running the programfiles environment variables is set to c program files x86 by default

1008246
background-color	transparency
i m trying to set the background-color of a uitableviewcell to transparency

1008261
rollback	commit
thus what you ll need to do if you enter that area z which will cause the commit you ll then need to put something in the thread-local also possibly via an aspects which that inner aspects will find and thus not throw the exception-handling to rollback the transactional

1008262
64bit	x86
this is because the x86 cpu calculates the value with 80bit while the value is stored as 64bit in memory .so you end up comparing a truncated 64bit value with a full 80bit value

1008262
32-bit	64bit
practically speaking i it is not quite that bad i could reproduce simple float points math with different versioning of gcc on 32-bit linux bit for bit but the moment i switched to 64bit linux the result were no longer the same

1008262
32-bit	64bit
demos recordings created on 32-bit wouldn t work on 64bit and vice versa but would work fine .when run on the same arch

1008264
.when	ready
it s the only thing i can think of that might cause your exception-handling .when the row is not ready

1008267
carbon	cocoa	foreground	dock
as your scripting probably doesn t run a carbon or cocoa event-loop see documentation for carbon event manager and nsapplication respectively the dock is waiting continuously expecting a regular foreground gui application to emerge

1008269
attributes	properties
i don t think there are many cases where this strategy is the best approach but it is an option to be aware of .when attempting to add properties or attributes to something you want to be able to treat as essentially an enum

1008272
constructor	object
the compiler figures out that it should create a temporary string object and call the char constructor

1008300
temporary	copy
then the temporary variables is copy construct into the parameter

1008300
constructor	object	copy-constructor	temporary	copy-constructor	constructor
note the std string object constructor takes a const reference is the parameter to the copy-constructor and that is why the first versioning works as the temporary is bound to the const reference parameter of the copy-constructor only

1008302
temporary	rvalue
an rvalue can t bind to a reference to non-const because a ref to non-const is stating you will modify the value and it wouldn t make sense to modify a temporary

1008311
constructor	object
the core language uses initialcaps for constructor object date numbers regexp and camelcase for methods and properties something.tostring quantity.valueof regexp.ignorecase

1008313
32-bit	64bit
.so a simplistic implementation would allocate a 512 mb arrays or a table with 2 29 rows each storing a byte or 2 27 rows each storing a 32-bit int or 2 26 rows each storing a 64bit int or...

1008316
constructor	object
just allocate a new object inside that constructor from the heap and copy the cstring into it

1008332
data-visualization	charts
see drawing on charts controls in flex data-visualization developer s guide flex-chartsing components using events and effects in chartss

1008369
codeigniter	symfony
my framework decisions boil down to this note that i primarily use cake little zend and have fiddled around with codeigniter and symfony

1008371
average	minimum
google rest arguments and you will find a lot of data on the subject with some examples like functions that will pass numbers and return an average of the numbers input maybe the minimum or maximum of all numbers passed

1008376
browser-cache	caching
while there s nothing wrong with this per se browser caching should be helping you out after the initial downloading it does mean that you have to deal with the browser-cache and there are some potential issues there

1008378
show	next
if those show that the operations are completing then my next step would be to go to a low-level and look at the actual transport layer

1008389
32-bit	64bit
.when sb managed to mess up his 64bit dir with 32-bit dlls

1008415

1008415
children	nodes
how to structure the hierarchy to make automatic changes to those parent nodes if their children s data changed

1008415
children	nodes
a nodes int field is the sum of the children int field and if any of the children changes the parent int field calculates the sum immediately

1008418
keydown	keyup
ok i got it its the keyup event not keydown thats causing this thanks for the help

1008432
any	set
also i am using html placeholder and i do not have any margins set on the subreport nor do i have any of these checked

1008481
.when	ready
.so if you put it where it can be found ideally .somewhere that is only found .when the paster shell starts then you should be able to add your import to it and have them be ready

1008494
debugging	trace
i ve used stack trace in production code exactly once and even that was really a debugging issue we had a problem with database connections not being properly closed .so i modified the get database connection function to save the identity of the caller and then had a periodic sweep to look for dead connections and see where they had been created

1008494
logging	trace
java s built-in logging function does stack trace .so it can write who called the logger to the logfile

1008509
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox and google-chrome the only two i have to test on at the moment neither the keydown nor the keypress events fire .when the keyboard focus is on the location bar and the enter key is pressed

1008509
keydown	keyup
.so i suppose you could stick with keydown and or keypress events or keep tracking of keydown events and ignore any keyup events that aren t preceded by a keydown

1008514
output	mode
whenever i run my application in debugging mode and then close it visual-studio printing the following to the output panels

1008519
persistent	transient
since the persistent and transient containers object have the same business key value what we really want is to issue an updates

1008530
combinations	permutation
capistrano is not indicating any errors .so not sure how to debugging have tried a billion permutation and combinations and nothing changes

1008542
32-bit	64bit
this macros is intended to make a 64bit value from two 32-bit value using the first arguments as the top 32-bit and the second arguments as the bottom 32-bit of the new value

1008543
setinterval	settimeout
also create threads to speed up user-interface using settimeout and setinterval

1008548
32-bit	64bit
it takes two 32-bit int and returns a 64bit int with the first parameter as the 32 high bits and the second as the 32 low bits

1008554

1008633
gethashcode	equals
these both produce a value of 3 for gethashcode causing equals to return true

1008654
double	int
it has more possible value than an int .so it is impossible to have a unique int for each double

1008656
difference	count
the numbers of difference found is the edit count

margins	padding
.when placing your elements on a page it is all about the box model and how margins padding and widths interact with each other

1008699
margins	padding
sometimes developers mix up padding margins which results in unexpected behavior

1008699
margins	padding
this way you are free to use margins padding freely without affecting the size of the parent element.

1008699
positioning	sidebar
clear your floats to positioning your content and sidebar or other column types elements you are going to have to use the float properties on one or more of your elements

1008699
margins	padding
.when in doubt reset your margins padding difference in browsers are frustrating to say the least

1008699
margins	padding
i always find that if reset the margins padding to 0 for a questionable elements i can easily correct spacing issues

a href contains with large set causes tds error

1009015
firefox	safari
safari 3.1+ and firefox 3.5 both support the audio elements

1009021

there shouldn t be scrollbar for overflow auto unless the content is actually going beyond the edges of the contains elements

1009034
value	field
i have one tclientdataset with several field and i m getting this exception-handling i m sure that i forgot to set one field value but the question is which field

1009035
double	int
if you want int-division to return an int and you ve import from future use a double

1009051
any	set
if you include the declarations inside tags in the html itself it will overwrite any styles set in external stylesheets

1009061
contains	any
i think this is a bug in the xmlserializer assuming that any types named arrayofdog contains a sequences of dog is meant to represent a dog

1009061
xsd	xml
if you want polymorphism in xml then both arrayofdog and cat will need to be extensions of the same base types other than xsd any

1009068
if-statement	arrays
if you want the arrays sorted smallest to largest as one would expect you need to reverse the if-statement

1009084
wamp	php
i install the wamp stack from bitnami.org and the php pages work completely fine .when visiting via apache which i have running on ports 8888

1009084
wamp	php
this same wamp stack from bitnami is working fine on another server .when the php .app runs as it s own website in iis since i can add a new php isapi filtering - but that tab option is not available on virtual directory

1009095
filtering	grouping
having - combined with + grouping+ this can be used to filtering the recording that a grouping by returns

1009107
sorted	lookup
the lookup list is already sorted

1009131
directory	folder
going to the .app tmp caching directory and removing the files in the model and persistent folder

1009137
contains	elements
according to what i read .when variables vec goes out of scoping in myfunc it should destruct its contains elements .so the destructor for a should be called

1009142
firefox	gecko
.when the above code is put in test.htm and loaded into firefox 3.0.11 and the latest 3.5 as of this edit - gecko 20090616 from the local disk you should see a dialog box that says

1009160
time-complexity	in-place
i thought hard but is it possible to do it in-place without using additional data-structures and with the time-complexity being o n

1009178
centering	fixed
i fixed it by setting root.transform.perspectiveprojection.projectioncentering to the centering of the stage

1009181

javascript	dom
i was returning a javascript text snippet as part of the value of a non-visible dom elements along with the rest of the html i was insert into the dom

1009182
javascript	dom
i had a lot of trouble debugging this types of dynamically generator javascript in ie6 .so this .solution worked out decently for me because i could inspect the value of the dom elements that was getting eval d

1009187
value	field
another option is to look at all the field and see for yourself which one lacks a value

1009228
asp.net-mvc	webforms
from asp.net-mvc building web apps without webforms

1009245
put	get
but the trick here is that you have to wait until server.exe exit to get the out put

1009258
perl	php
note i am not familiar with the php syntax and i have guessed incrementer and decrementer syntax since it seems to be similar to perl

1009260
checkbox	textarea	selected	checkbox	radio	click
edit i m more needing to know if they are actively using the site therefore click changing field or positioning within a field or selected checkbox radio or typing in an input textarea etc

1009267
telnet	tcp
if telnet windows will be closed - the sql-server doesn t listen the ip the ports or tcp

1009268
click	mouse
you can watch mouse movement but that s about the best you re going to get for indication of a user still being there without listening to the click event

1009281
recording	playing
for recording and or playing sound

1009300
any	set
using jquery you can easily watch mouse movement and use it to set a variables indicating activity to true then using vanilla javascript you can checked this variables every 30 minutes or any other interval to see if its true

1009300
setinterval	settimeout
lookup settimeout and setinterval for doing the timing

1009307
itemtemplate	gridview
i am trying very hard to pass three parameters to a javascript function from within a itemtemplate of a gridview

1009313
debugging	trace
missed that part that you are developing the .app. run the .app in debugging mode and checked the debuggingger console types in - bt to back trace stack

1009319
unique	words
as others have pointed out diacritics are there for a reason they are essentially unique letters in the alphabet of that language with their own meaning sound etc. removing those marks is just the same as replacing random letters in an english words

1009319
contains	set
similarly the unicode character set contains hundreds of mathematical and pictorial symbols there is no easy way for users to directly enter these .so you can assume they can be ignore

1009326
function-pointers	virtual-functions
in c++ one way to get late dynamic-binding is to use function-pointers we can also use virtual-functions

1009337
double-quotes	single-quotes
make sure you use double-quotes instead of single-quotes other wise the arguments isn t expaneded

1009341
httphandler	httpmodule
this is really a job for a httpmodule not a httphandler

1009354
versioning	upgrade
1. in your gac ed dll upgrade the minor versioning numbers

1009365
firefox	safari
strangly enough in ie 6 7 8 it works fine but in firefox safari i m using mac but tested it in windows and they both give the same problems the map doesn t load entirely

1009365
firefox	safari
please take a look at the link below and click the third tab in firefox safari and ie and you will see the problem

by adding clr to the world you ll have to deal with interop issues and possibly handle with nasty pointers issues since the nature of it is dealing with low-level hardware related stuff in c#

1009410
cursor	row
a cursor updates which is how you would updates a million rows in a non-batch fashion would iterate through each row one a time and updates it

1009410
updating	updates
.so you may need to do a loops that takes only part of the batch-file at a time but pretty much any numbers greater than one row at time will be faster than one row at a time this is slower than updating or insert or deleting the whole batch-file but faster than row-by row operations and may be needed in a production-environment with many users and little available downtime .when users are not trying to see and updates other recording in the same table

1009411
keyboard	mouse
in a nutshell idlemonitor is a class that observes mouse and keyboard events adjust accordingly for your needs

1009427
base-class	inherited
you could theoretically strong types the masterpage and make sure that all viewmodel inherited from some base-class that gives you strong-typesd access to the variables for setting the error messages in your master page but that seems like overkill

1009434
temporary	copy	temporary	rvalue
the expression a 1 is an rvalue and construct a new a value the compiler may then copy this into a temporary object inorder to bind to the const reference that push_back takes

1009444
sql-server	ms-access
i am attempting to write data from sql-server 2005 to ms-access 2007

1009444
value	field
from the information i have gathered the sql equivalent of an access yes no field would be a bit field with value of either 0 or 1

1009444
boolean	int
i have tried casting to boolean and int and haven t had any success

1009444
value	field
since the source field is a yes no types does it accept int value

1009446
base-class	inherited
they will all inherited from a base-class that will have a companyid properties

1009476
development-environment	licensing
i ve used vs.php for years with great success but i ve run out of licensing on all my machines and i want to have a unified development-environment for my php programming

1009520
any	set
is there any way to set multiple items all at once in the model and have datachanged emitted only once for the whole change

1009529
font-size	height	font-size	width
do i have to calculate it by hand determining the height and width of the glyphs from the font-size etc. or is there a more straightforward way

1009530
frame	width
next create your uisearchbar but set the frame s width to 30 or whatever makes sense for your .app less than the uiview

1009531
hash	md5
to ensure uniqueness you ll have to also create a separate varchar column to store an md5 or sha1 hash and add a unique or primary index

1009532
json	xml
what you can do of course if to expose two distinct endpoint from your service - one returning xml another returning json and then programmatically pick which one to call from your client .app

1009532
json	xml
updates as steve michelotti correctly points out this automatic switching between json and xml can now be achieved in wcf 4.0

1009538
keydown	keyup
other important items to note non-character key including page down page up etc. do not raise a keypress event they only raise keydown and keyup keypress events are swallowed by the form if you set

1009594
updating	updates
i m updating one object and trying to updates any child object along with it

1009597
click	mouse
if i click the updates button using the mouse the commandname updates gets passed as expected just not .when i click it via javascript

square-bracket	parentheses
.so basically i need to know if what is between the parentheses is numeric and ignore everything between the close parentheses and close square-bracket

1009650
value	field
then i added the username email field then searched for how to display an alert box and checked i could display the form value

1009662

i am using 1.3.2 and using your code copy-paste i can successfully run this in firefox 3 ie 8 and google-chrome

1009695
linux	unix
for linux unix

1009700
asp.net-mvc	webforms
basically it just comes down to a matter of opinion whether you want to use the built-in webforms and asp.net-mvc frameworks with .net or whether you long for cgi-style php or mod_perl scripting

1009704
margins	padding
margins and padding on all these elements are set to 0

1009705
coff	elf
the tool is available on solaris for elf which is an extension of coff and probably elsewhere

1009715
user-interface	drawing
i imagen you could use this methods to overlay the elements you need every time the image is draw in the user-interface this would happen numerous time as you are not drawing on the image data its self but may be suser-interfacetable to your purposes and advantageous if the overlay changes over time

1009742
attributes	properties
what you will need to do is create a custom fieldtemplate and use the uihint attributes on the column properties to direct asp.net-dynamic-data to use that custom fieldtemplate in insert and edit mode

1009751
hide	show	stderr	stdout
this is probably not the problem but the console view in eclipse has some toggle button to show hide the console .when output from either stdout or stderr changes

1009774
selected	listbox
.when a listbox has a contextmenu you do not need menu s positioning because the selected item is set before the menu popped up

1009787
firefox	safari
some browsers originally only ie but firefox 3 and safari jumped on the wagon support the document.activeelement properties which achieves what you want

1009792
put	get
for example i might need to send a short arrays of numbers and this could either be encode in amf via netconnection.call or could be put into get parameters using sendtourl

1009803
global-assembly-cache	gac
.so you add the policy assembly to the global-assembly-cache in wise and as long as you have the policy file .config in the same location on the machine wise will automatically add it to gac as well

1009808
google-chrome	firefox
.so the real meat of this question is if anybody knows of a .solution that works for firefox and google-chrome

1009811
duplicates	contains
.so a player could just duplicates that packets and resend it to the server many time without ever having to know what unencrypted data was contains in the packets

1009820
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
in a lot of python ruby perl apps you write 10 of the code and import libs to do the other 90

1009820
python	c++
c++ vs python is a pretty personal choice

1009832
document-ready	.when
essentially .when you run a piece of code on your document-ready it is being execute against the current state of the document

1009832
mouseover	mouseout
another solution would be to run the binding code again after you add a new but that is not as clean as just using live which supports the mouseover and mouseout events you re going to need to do the hover

1009841
base-class	inherited
let s say i am building a bunch of user-controls in an asp.net web application and that all those user-controls inherited from a custom base-class that i have created which in turn inheriteded from system.web.ui.usercontrol

1009853
specifications	w3c
a lot of them are pretty much arbitrary strings but there here is the w3c s specifications for the commonly used ones

1009863
web-applications	web-services
i am inclined to conclude that web-services are very different than web-applications and accept option 1 always stateless but it would be nice to hear other opinions based on real project experience

1009868
average	max	average	min
it took min 0.4sec average 0.5sec max 0.6sec

1009877
debugging	trace
if you want to trace fork events and extraction child pids for debugging purposes there are a numbers of ways to do that including

1009888
puts	gets
this puts the original stack-trace in the _remotestacktracestring field of the exception-handling which gets concatenation to the newly reset stack-trace .when the exception-handling is re-thrown

1009895
value	field
unfortunately the generator proxy does not allow me to not specify the value the parameters are not nullable and there are no specified field as part of the call to instruct the proxy that no value should be sent

1009938
unique	words
the main difference to english is that two characters are often already a words and the base character set to draw from is much bigger .so that there is already a lot of information in the bi-gram and there are much more unique bi-grams

1009942
freebsd	linux	solaris	freebsd	solaris	linux
using gtk on x windows linux freebsd solaris you can use the xembed protocols to embed widget using gtk.socket

1009967
paintcomponent	drawimage
overrides the paintcomponent methods to do a drawimage using the image stored in the field

1009993
digits	base
one could in principles consider the question body in terms of an int expressed lowest digits first in base 256 or larger if you wish to think about it as unicode

1009994
python	perl
i am open to a perl python groovy scripting that would do this.

1009998
spring	jsf
if you mean that you have one .war with web-services defined in it and another separate .war with the jsf stuff i think it s really two separate project each with their own spring configuration

1010011
value	field
the updates cmd gives me an error stating that it cannot insert null into the primary key field even though .when checked all the value in every row it is definitely not null for any of them

1010016
protected	public
i assume loops is through each field in the object both public and non-public field - and i ve read that protected field are forbidden with reflection on medium trust

1010029
abstract-factory	factory-method
this isn t just the factory-method - this looks more like the abstract-factory pattern

1010046
google-chrome	firefox
this works on firefox and google-chrome but fails in ie 8 and presumably other ie s as the focus call fails for some reason maybe the dom isn t ready

1010048
boost-statechart	state-machines
i use it with boost-statechart for large state-machines

1010052
linux	unix
the most comprehensive detail about a table on db2 for linux unix and windows can be obtained from the db2look utility which you can run from a remote client or directly on the db2 server as a local user

1010073
google-chrome	firefox
the following solution has been tested in google-chrome firefox ie8 and ie8 in ie7 compatibility mode

1010083
beautifulsoup	mechanize
but if you still want to write a screens scraper it s hard to beat a combinations of mechanize and beautifulsoup

1010083
beautifulsoup	mechanize
beautifulsoup is an html parsing and mechanize is a python-based web browser that will let you login store cookies and generally navigate around like any other web browser

1010100
boolean	int
updates the jet internal storage of a boolean is as an int go figure--but that s what they chose...

1010133
n-gram	words
you split a words into its constituent n-gram such as for the words hello you would get hel lo

1010133
n-gram	words
then you building an index with n-gram as key and the words they come from as the value

1010133
n-gram	words
from that list you selected the words that had the highest numbers of matched n-gram

1010137
put	get
myself i seem to resort to similar tricks like this more and more often simply because they work and they get the job done ... note also if you were using a separate viewmodel which i recommend for this you could put this code in there and leave your domain model nice and clean

1010138
ruby-on-rails	django
the last benefit is that this is the design of most modern web-frameworks such as django and ruby-on-rails

1010167
contains	lookup
if you have a lot of rows and you want to be able to read the core information from the table very quickly then it may be worth splitting it into two tables - one with small rows with only the core info that can be read quickly and an extra table contains all the info you rarely use that you can lookup .when needed

1010169
subtraction	time
i don t know if i fully understand what you are trying to do but you can just deal with time as numbers of seconds since the unix epoch and then just use plain old subtraction to get a range that you can scale to the size of your plot

1010181
updating	updates
the problem is that inorder to avoid concurrency violations .when updating i have to clear the dataset after updates and refill it like this

1010181
selected	cell
.when i clear the dataset it clears the datagrid and its selected cell

1010181
selection	cell
this is very annoying since if you edit a cell and hit enter or a directional key the cell and database will updates fine but your selection gets reset instead of navigating to the next row cell

1010194
constructor	object
but obviously they only work for creating object and initializing properties directly after calling the constructor not at any points like vb s with which has almost the exact syntax you re describing in your question

1010213
any	set
seems like there is no any managed profiling set up

1010213

nor do i believe that the sparklines images go in the viewmodel what if my view wants to represent the data differently say as a grid row just showing min max average standards deviation etc

1010285
children	nodes
but i have looked at kay s xslt programmer s reference the xslt cookbook and learning xslt and i still cannot find a clear explanation of how a nodes and its children will be process by a set of rules

1010296
difference	zero
i ve meticulously run diff on the verbose maven debugging output -x and there are zero difference in the runtime dependencies between the two

1010320

asp.net-mvc - html.textbox throw object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1010338
xsl-fo	xslt
if you have some money to spend on training ken holman has an excellent set of xml xslt xpath xsl-fo training courses

1010338
push	pull
then xslt templates and the distinction between push and pull really make sense

1010339
directory	folder
the working directory is . root the png file is in . root img test.png how do i have asp.net display my images and everything else in the folder

1010347
loading	png
loading images such as jpeg and png can be performed by using the imageio class

1010347
bufferedimage	graphics2d
the imageio.read methods takes in a file to read in and returns a bufferedimage which can be used to manipulate the image via its graphics2d or the graphics its superclass context

1010369
python	ruby	python	java
it is similar to java s reflection and it s also commonly used in dynamic-languages python ruby php...

1010381
factors	primes
i d just like to know the best way of listing all int factors of a numbers given a dictionary of its primes factors and their exponent

1010403
any	set
with silverlight having a very discrete set of controls and layout mechanisms compared to asp.net iâ d be very surprised is any tool did a neat translation

1010440
put	get
returns the named of the http-method with which this request was made for example get .post or put

1010442

1010475
compatibility	legacy
being a legacy .app i d like to maintain compatibility and not change the structure of the table

1010491
difference	factors
the difference seemed to be around 8ms for each on my local machine although i m not positive on if that grows by factors the more you use

1010497
cassini	iis
the visual-studio webserver aka cassini won t accept remote connections - you need to use iis

1010498
directory	folder
if you have windows-xp professional or vista with iis you can create a virtual directory that points to your publishing folder

1010500
google-chrome	safari
interesting that webkit google-chrome and safari display the css even with the misspelling

1010505
put	get
hi i have a table with some some value ids and of course .when i get the result i got just the int ids but i want to put it more user friendly for example .when its the numbers 1 i want to put the string avaible .when its 2 not avaible im on an n tiers environment and i need to get this done on the model whats the best way to accomplish this i have to declare another class to project the strings or must i use something like a dictionary key - value

1010613
symbolic-math	sage
sage has support for symbolic-math

1010619
push	pull
you can quite easily manage code in bazaar with something like 4 cmd add commit merge maybe push pull and log or qlog and you only need merge if you want multiple branches

1010623
bazaar	git
what are the relative strengths and weaknesses of git mercurial and bazaar

1010631
constructor	object
b object that know how to initializer and free their contains object though pointers to object would be exempted as we would like to have the ability to shared object .so the setting up of constructor to initializer and destructor to free the contains object are not needed

1010977
linux	minix	netbsd	linux	netbsd	minix
though if your looking for good kernel source to read i wouldn t go with linux it s a beast of a hack about like saying the gcc sources are fun instead you may wish to try minix or one of the bsds darwin is basically a branch of netbsd iirc or even one of the many free dos clones if everything else is a little too scary

1014419
any	set
there isnt really any user-interface rendering for the aspose excel control .so you should be able to just create an object call .some methods to set things up and then streaming the generator file out to the response just the same way you would in a button click event

1014440
data-members	instances
i overload the new-operator for that object malloc the memory and use the returned pointers as a pointers to the yet un-initialized instances and set a specific data-members of the object to some magic-value

1014498
arrays	loops
al.so note that if i was 0 .when it got tested in the conditional then it will be 1 in loopss body for the while example .so if i is an index for an arrays or .something and not just keeping tracking of loops iterator you d be better to stick with just a for-loops which increment i after each iterator

1014505

1014515
interpreter	runtime
the result is in no way interpreter the cil is jitted into machine-code at runtime or via ngen if desired and certain aspects of the dlr mean some actions are deferred in a similar fashion to late-binding but more powerfully and crucially with some sophisticated caching mechanisms to allow this to be relatively fast compared with naive interpreter

1014752
bug-tracking	bugzilla
bug-tracking - bugzilla

1014773
pointers	stack
as a further thought if you want to be more explicit with your reductions if you are doing ast annoation this can be handy then you can make your stack value pointers and then handle types value yourself

1014775
nsmutablearray	nsarray
nsmutablearray is a subclassing of nsarray .so it responds to all the same methods

1014781
stderr	stdout
if you re using the execute task to executeute devenv.exe change it to executeute devenv.com this should printing warnings to stdout i think it s stdout might be stderr but warnings shouldn t stop the building

much of the work in a program is done by evaluation expression either for their side-effects such as assignments to variables or for their value which can be used as arguments or operands in larger expression or to affect the execution sequences in statements or both

1014827
value	field
this will clear the field in the form to the default value

1014827
value	field
if you have default-values in the field though like input types text value enter named here then .when you trip .reset it will reset to the default-value

1014828
value	field
make sure the value in the field are actually coming from your ruby-on-rails .app by checked the html source windows

1014828

i ve currently been given the task to ports our webforms solution to asp.net-mvc

1014987
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my initial approach was to have two website a webforms site and an asp.net-mvc site and then linking the two using iframes from the asp.net-mvc side

1014987
asp.net-mvc	webforms
after doing more research i discovered that i can mix the boys and use the webforms architecture inside an asp.net-mvc project

1014987
asp.net-mvc	webforms
view .somedir webforms and then ignore that directory in my global-asax file .so that the asp.net-mvc router systemd does not pick it up

1015064
for-loop	loops
don t monkey with loops index variables of a for-loop to make it terminate

1015067
xsd	xml
i had to work with biztalk and found that generator my classes from an xsd and then serializing that class over the wire wa-la xml worked quite well

1015073
assign	add
if you have to change the enum later add more value etc you can explicit assign the int value to the enum value .so that your enum representation in code still matches what you have in the database

1015091
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i do not see the points in porting something to asp.net-mvc just to keep half of it in traditional webforms

1015115
directory	folder
i have a sub folder that has an aspx page and a web-config file that overrides a connection-string in the web-config in the root directory

1015115
contains	any
the problem is if the aspx page contains any user-controls the user-controls still get the connection-string from the web-config in the root directory

1015122

1015202
qtcore	qtgui
-i usr include qt4 qtcore -i usr include qt4 qtgui -i usr include qt4 -i

1015211
instances	destroy
i think creating a close or destroy methods is your safest bet to ensure that the resources the instances of the c++ class associated with your java object is using are release appropriately

1015217
attributes	properties
as you can see it expects column attributes with isprimarykey on class properties

1015221
subproject	libs
if otoh a project can contains different subproject where a subproject is an executable or libs you should be able to handle that easily

1015226
silverlight	wpf
.so given the situation above you got a custom object with 3-6 properties you just want to dump as readonly to your gui how would you do it in wpf silverlight too if you are really in the mood

1015235
margins	padding
some of the padding and margins attributes don t always rendering

1015245
versioning	upgrade
i have been in this positioning before and i did a cost-benefit analysis for management and showed that it would cost more money to do the dual versioning than do the upgrade

1015280
bmp	png
the bmp and png maintain the same bit depth as the tif

1015282
django-haystack	xapian
i would go with either solr or xapian although it s not quite officially supported by django-haystack yet

1015289
environment	building
cygwin is more than just compilers it tries to provide a unix programming environment by building a lot of unix libs on top of windows sdk

1015298
png	gif
if you really need compatibility offer both gif png

1015324
default-value	default
although i haven t used c# 4.0 optional-parameters yet i imagine they behave similarly to the way vb.net optional-parameters did in that you can specify a default-value at the function and that default will be used if the caller doesn t specify it

1015341
text-align	width
why don t inline-styles work in this case and why must i use a class selector for width but an elements selector for text-align

1015359
environment	building
3 in your building file just call the xml mass updates task and provide the right environment as a parameter

1015359
configuration	environment	environment	building
just run the building file and then move the updates configuration file to your deployment environment and you are done

1015392
any	set
you can also use the with recompile if the set is changing but the query plan is no longer any good

1015399
interpreter	runtime
in 2.6 we now delay compiling things until they re actually run the first time interpreter them if they re only needed once or twice and we ve move a bunch of code we d generator at runtime into ironpython.dll .so it too benefits from ngen

1015400
configuration	installation
these are the fonts which you can use with your current installation configuration of rmagick

1015402
if-statement	loops
i suppose i could use a loops and run through it three time but that actually seems like it ll be at least as bulky by the time i conditionalize the if-statement

1015434
decimal-point	zero
a better variant would be to only chop of zero that are after a decimal-point

1015449
implements	abstract
i can implements an abstract technique or algorithm myself if need be but if it s a pre-existing tool i would prefer it to be free at least as in beer and run on linux

1015460
lookup	any
i would suggest using a lookup table for square roots of pixels if this is going to be any sort of real time application

1015461
qtcore	qtgui
-i usr include qt4 qtcore -i usr include qt4 qtgui -i usr include qt4 -i

1015483
spring	jsf
sample application using jsf spring 2.5 and java persistent apis with glassfish v2

1015493
put	get
youâ re likely to get better user performance if you put the section links on the sidebar menu and the subsection links in the tabs rather than the other way around

1015494
environment	execution
what is the best way to call foo in a controlled manner my current environment is pthreads c++ such that i can stop execution after a certain numbers of seconds

1015521
create-table	alter-table
alter-table add column creates a copy of the full table and then replace the old one with the new create-table

1015529
variables	boolean
from the examples i have seen people typically use a private boolean member variables dispose and set it to true inside of dispose

1015529
subclassing	base-class
at first i thought that the subclassing would not have to anything special like implements their own versioning of dispose since the thing that needs to be dispose is only in the base-class let s assume that the subclassing won t be adding any data that needs to be explicit dispose and the base-class dispose should handle that

1015529
subclassing	base-class
should the subclassing overrides the base-class virtual dispose methods solely for the purpose of setting its own dispose member variables

1015529
subclassing	base-class
.so you see that the base-class owns and manages the performancecounter object which is idisposable while the subclassing use the performancecounter

1015537
arguments	default
by default if you pass the same arguments to mysql_connect as a previous call it ll return a caching connection if available rather than creating a new one

1015539
arrays	loops
there is more than one way to loops through the data arrays

1015571
getter	setter	protected	public
is it possible to generator a properties with a public getter and a protected setter with codedom

1015571
any	set
but .so long i haven t found any ways to set the setter protected or similar

1015571
attributes	properties
one way might be to mark the properties as not serialization and serialization the _field but since one goal for the serialization output is web i d need to attributes the private member with all the possible serialization attributess that direct the serialization to use a cleaner named without the underscore.js for serialization

1015572
defined	declare
these strings are declare and defined as follows

1015595
show	next
next if i click on b1 i want the to show this list

1015602
constructor	object
the __new__ __init__ behavior in python is an example of the two-step construction design pattern the constructor proper is __new__ it building and returns a normally uninitialized object normally a new one of the types class in question

1015611
python	ruby	python	lua
also many scripting languages such as python ruby lua etc

1015614
python	ruby
the popular scripting languages like python and ruby let you program in functional styles as well

1015634
python	ruby
javascript python and ruby could be used that way but scala bumps up a notch by typing the function statically and working under jvm

1015641
arrays	loops
the for field in recs loops generator the list of indexes not the arrays elements

1015656
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
it could be easily brought into effect with python ruby perl or similar interpreted-language

1015665
groovy	java
if you like programming in groovy instead of java checkout griffon

1015699
textbox	button
it basically needs to spawn a windows write log information to a textbox and have an input box and a couple of start stop button

in the spirit of automating the build-process i d like ant to automatically named the zipped distributable with the current versioning numbers but i m not sure how

1015741
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
which ever module you use you can downloading guibuilder from sourceforge and it writes pretty good tk or tkx code for perl and tk code for python ruby

1015743
checkbox	button	checkbox	textbox	textbox	button
the main windows had a menu a textbox and a few button and checkbox

1015744
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
with a modern language like c# and powerful ide s like visual-studio and even sharpdevelop there really is no excuse for extended debugging sessions that consist solely of console.writeline statements

1015756
linux	osx
windowss it s start uri osx it s open-uri linux has no equivalent as it all depends upon their windows manager

1015763
synchronous	.when
think twice .when u want it to be synchronous

1015765
version-control	git
i ve been in search for a good text-editor ide which is cross-platform and supports mercurial git or allows me to add in other version-control systemd

1015787
margins	padding
.outerwidth true include the padding margins since you re passing true .so there s no need to try add that in again

1015839
updatepanel	gridview
i have a page with two updatepanel each of which has a gridview generator dynamically

1015852
required	checked
ultimately i could just do the above checked inside the methods but the annotations way of doing things provides additional documentation which makes it obvious that the user required a particular privileges without having to keep the documentation in sync with the code

1015872
triggers	insert
there are triggers involved but i m getting the errors on ddl statements not on updates or insert

1015872
rollback	commit
basically they do a commit then the metadata changes which can involve a numbers of underlying object then a commit again assuming the ddl succeeds - if it fails the change should be rollback

1015927
firefox	opera
a numbers of years ago there was a highly visible discussion about mis-use of http cookiess leading to various cookies filtering proxy and eventually to active cookies filtering in browsers like firefox and opera

1015948
cvs	git
another solution is to use the keyword substitution feature from cvs and svn perhaps git and mercurial have this feature too and make a clever use of this feature

1015949
substitution	replace
the substitution replace whatever matches the regex with the replacement .so given the following code

1015959
callback	methods
you make a category on nsobject that declare the named of your callback methods

1015959
delegation	dealloc
it s a good idea in the dealloc methods of a class that that has a myclass instances and is its delegation to clear that delegation reference since it s a weak back pointers

1015963
locale	french
i m wary to use a locale like german or french because it probably will not include all of the special characters i need to consider

1015963
arrays	map
my naive solution would be to create a large associativity arrays to map accented letters to their regular letter equivalent then using this with str_replace but that sounds slow and tedious and error-prone

1015978
coalesce	isnull
fyi - it s sql-server syntax but coalesce is just like isnull for the most part

1016011
scala	java
and recently saw topics on scala two words description java scripting and a framework built on that called lift three words description codeigniter for java

1016011
scala	java	python	ruby	python	java
scala allows people who love programming in python and ruby to use java s jvm without the cost with a lot of syntactic elegance scala is somewhat more intuitive to my python-centric mind than clojure

1016015
firefox	safari
these will load the page you give it in either firefox or safari and you can tweak them to loops like crazy and allow the flash movie to run

1016022
contains	set
you need to set the standards html attributes to safe value and add additonal attributes that contains the actual value

1016024
any	set
if the form is invalid then you are redirecting to a new page which will loose any modal error value you set

1016050
engineyard	heroku
in the beginning though if you just need the code updates and maybe ruby-on-rails migrations then you can do simpler things like passenger and code sync or look at tools like heroku or engineyard s stuff where they do a deploy by doing a git-clone and then offer some additional abilities

1016062
automake	cmake
consider using a makefile generator systemd of some sort - cmake or the auto-tools autoconf libtool automake etc

1016065
binaries	install
however you should be able to install it using yum or the binaries at

1016081
registration	login
user registration email activation login access-control are very common tasks

1016093
debugging	exit
with that in mind how would i go about using nslog to output some final debugging messages .when my application exit

1016101
foreign-key-relationship	schema
db2 does not required both tables in a foreign-key-relationship to reside in the same schema

1016109
protected-mode	real-mode
does the real-mode initialization mostly bios call which have to be done before switching to protected-mode

1016111
output	mode
within your constrants i would use aes in cfb mode which turns it into a streaming cypher and the output length will be the same as the input length

1016114
default-value	default
some day it might stop maybe it only uses one value as a default parameter of some function and maybe that default-value changes from to 0

1016149
pixels	line
i m thinking about maybe only placing anchor .when the angle of the next pixels is beyond 180 degrees in relation to the current line or something and just grabbing the edges of the arc between these changes but no matter how hard i try i can t seem to figure out how to get this working

1016151
compatibility	legacy
one compatibility thing for legacy applications is that some of them might be an install or an udpater and can only function .when run as administration

1016165
perl	php
i develop applications using php or java and will study perl for the first time

1016165
perl	php
for php and java there are integrated development-environments such as eclipse and debugging environment was regulated well but in the case of perl what kind of development-environment do people use

1016166
delphi	basic	pascal	delphi	pascal	basic
if i recall correctly basic turned into pascal while pascal was busy turning into delphi

1016174
any	set
do you have any arrays where the max length is set

1016174
contains	any
do you make any assumptions about which data is contains i a spesific item in an arrays

1016197
put	get
the problem is then the test classes are in their own libs they don t get linked into the main test program unless i explicit call them i have to put in

1016215
any	set
2 for any users that need full access set a token in hkcu which enables full access

1016219
concatenation	comma
join automatically takes care of concatenation and also does not put the trailing comma on the string

1016222
decrement	increment
in the most practical of these assembly you just choose a region of memory available to you set stack register to points to the bottom then increment or decrement to implements your pushes and pops

1016228
environment	building
a good configurable editor i m partials to ultraedit will allow you to building your own environment using the tools you want instead of foisting an all-encompassing solution on you

1016235
quirks-mode	doctype
use a valid doctype and get out of quirks-mode

1016258

1016265
contains	set
the charset of the contains page is set to utf-8

1016286
xerces	jaxp
i ve even opened the gwt-gears.jar file and confirmed that org xerces jaxp saxparserfactoryimpl.class does exist

1016294
perl	c++
you are much better off downloading the package and installing it via ppm as i describe in how do i use ms c++ express 2008 to building perl unicode map on windows

1016300
synchronous	.when
.when the event dispatcher starts is there an event i can listen for in my mainscreen that will give me the event thread where i can happily do synchronous startup tasks

1016300
void	main
static public void main string arguments

1016303
put	get
in this approach you just put all your classes into one namespace and get your code working

1016304
put	get
in facebook you only have server.php and there is where you make the request even for .post get put delete...

1016318
shell	bash
case-in-point is while most languages allow shell integration and process control very few are as well suited to the task as bash scripting

1016322
arrays	loops
you could do it yourself without too much difficulty either just loops over each line in the file and split it on comma and put it in your arrays

1016343
selected	button
that is the user it connect as is the one selected in the connection dialog that you get .when you click the new query button and don t have an object explorer connect

1016347
aggregate	grouping
sql s groupby clause produces a grouping key with aggregate value - there is no sub-collection to work with

1016370
fclose	fopen
instead of messing with excel you should be able to read the text file directly into matlab using the functions fopen fgetl fscanf and fclose

1016377
put	get
put .post or get not different urls

1016413
comm	grep
it appears that grep -l solves the real problem of the poster but for the actual question asked finding the intersection of two sets of strings you might want to look into the comm cmd

1016413
contains	sorted
for example if file1 and file2 each contains a sorted list of wordss one words per line then

1016419
value	field
i have to retrieve only particular recording whose sum value of size field is 150

1016435
.net	wcf
i am using vsts 2008 + c# + .net 3.5 + wcf

1016440
put	get
those verbs get .post put and delete together with the path indicate what you want to do to the data on the server

1016449
button	popup
i have the facebook connect button working and it popup with a slew of friend id s .when they login.

1016456
event-log	logfile
write to a logfile or the event-log

1016465
reliability	scalability
there is a learning curve but it s well worth it if you need the reliability flexibility and scalability that sql service-broker offers

1016466
sql-server	mysql
is mysql or sql-server the best one to use

1016490
contains	set
the second capture should contains all of the information between the set of

1016501
filtering	grouping
if you wish to not have a grouping of files within a project inspected you can filtering these files out .so they are not inspected by creating a file filtering

actually in many languages including c python perl basic non-zero int pointers value

1016512
postgresql	mysql

i think that getter and setter should only be used for variables which one needs to access or change outside a class

1016535

that s why i believe in the proper use of getter and setter but you don t need them for every private or protected variables

1016540
compatibility	platform
of course if you need multi platform compatibility this step is not acceptable

the difference between ref and out is subtle but important

1016611
ref	out
the important difference between out and ref parameters is the definite assignment rules used by each

1016628
malloc	free
i can see how you could do this for memory allocated off the heap using a custom versioning of malloc and free but i don t know about enforcing it on stack too

1016652

i would definitely use any wrapper for imagick instead of the php-gd .lib as the latter required you to set memory pretty darn high and you re not always allowed to if you rent place at webhotels

1016658

because it would required implicit boxing the receiver type-parameter ...

1016763

1016966
getter	setter
to me their example looks very bloated with a ton of getter and setter all over the place

textbox	button	listbox	textbox
i m writing a small .app that required a few listbox button textbox

1018243
properties-file	executable-jar
this isn t great but you could have it as an executable-jar and then in it s main have it execute itself via the command-line as a non-daemon thread with the proper params stored in a properties-file or calculated or whatever then exit the original

1018259
input-field	selected
the input-field is single line .so i am using the arrow up down key to selected a suggestion and enter to insert it

1018310
printwriter	ioexception
printwriter getwriter throw ioexception

1018317

you could do this with xml and that is probably easiest for downloading the original document but you would probably have the easiest time using json for the postback to the server

1018317
ruby	php	json	xml
you will need a server-side scripting php asp ruby to receive the posted data format it however desired turn the json into an xml document and save it either as a file or in a database

1018384
versioning	upgrade
now .when you install this versioning onto a device that has the old model - it will automatically upgrade that model to the new model

1018391
getter	setter
.when using a dependency properties the get and set methods must just be simple wrapper for this.getvalue and this.setvalue the rea.son for this is that wpf does not use the getter or setter to access the value .so you can t depend on the extra code running all the time

1018410
compact-framework	.net
fyi - i am using .net compact-framework

1018418
value	field
i often wonder if it would be better to use an int or a decimal value for the ordinals field

1018447
boolean	int
to give one tiny example .when you distinguish clearly between expression and statements as opposed to is syntactically incorrect for using a statement where an expression was expected and not merely a types error for using an int where a boolean was expected

1018484
expression	evaluation
i already know that linq works by evaluation expression and iterator one by one thru them kinf of like a pipeline however there are certain operations like orderby that need to be buffering since sorting needs to analize all the data at once to do the sort

1018510
32-bit	64bit
then you are printing the 64bit value with x format modifiers - that expects 32-bit value on stack

1018520
expression	evaluation
deferred execution means that the evaluation of an expression is delayed until its realized value is actually required

1018537

your dll doesn t know how to call methods pointers unless it was written in delphi or c++ builder

1018594
instances	private
in effect each instances of your class that could call into the dll will have its own private callback

1018602
widget	button
qt visual-studio integration allows you to get quickly from a button on your form to the corresponding button-click-handler in your c++ source code by click on that widget

1018604

you could have an arrays of 50 function-pointers c# delegation which you index using the value of first byte or a dictionary of delegation whose key is the the value of first byte

1018616
click	mouse
the actionscript that initiates full-screen mode can be called only in response to a mouse click or keypress

1018637
linux	unix
for everything else you additionally need glext.h and probably glxext.h linux unix or wglext.h windows

1018639
exception-handling	error-handling
also don t forget to use extensive error-handling in your routine because any unhandled exception-handling outside of a debugger will abruptly crash your application

1018673
show	next
i really wannt autocompletebox functionality in this column but the datagrid needs to be optimized for data entry which meeans if the users can t tab or automatically be taken to the next field its a show stopper

1018691
text-editor	editor
if he really wants to learn how to do things right then i would start with just a simple text-editor maybe with code highlight and a freeimage editor

1018704
filtering	sorting
i m trying to write a linq-to-sql methods that handles sorting paging and filtering for an ajax grid

1018715

google-chrome	safari
and paste a snippet of the html .so we can test in safari google-chrome

1018726
numeric	digits
numeric digits

1018726
value	field
after the user exit the field the value should be rounded to the maximum allowed digits and preferably formatted according to the os settings for legibility

1018726
keyboard	mouse
.when the field acquires focus via mouse or keyboard it should immediately show available options if they are not very numerous

1018745
interop	vsto
all the common ways of dealing with unhandled exception-handling for managed-code don t seem to work presumably because of vsto using managed-code with office com interop

entity-framework	ado.net
creating ado.net entity-framework entity

1018760
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
if you have another code process that you need to wait for completion you can either join that thread or use either a manualresetevent or autoresetevent

1018765
triggers	insert
for added fanciness you can set a before insert triggers on your receiving table that sets the new primary key for reach row before the insert occurs thereby using regular dump and still clearing your pk

1018770
uiscrollview	subviews
i am using the accelerometer to scroll multiple subviews in a uiscrollview

1018777
postgresql	mysql
also any solution that could export to mysql or postgresql database formats will be welcome

1018779

get attributes for the properties

1018811
any	set
create the control create an html writer set any settings or databind the control then call the rendering methods using the html writer

1018819
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you can use the asp.net-controls such as gridview datagrid and points them rendering into stringbuilder using stringwriter no need to use asp.net page for this this is a simple example in console

1018824
button	popup
i can able to achieve this onclientclick of anyother button on my base page but as that particular button is coming from a user-controls i am not able to triggers the popup windows

1018825

sinatra	ramaze
try say a simple ruby framework like sinatra or ramaze

1018833
symfony	joomla
php is fine .when written well and good for learning how to construct html templates and symfony seems like a sound framework but avoid starting off by hacking say wordpress or joomla

1018834
ubuntu	linux
our domain named points at a linux ubuntu 9.04 server clean install nothing apart from the load balancing software

1018853
alloca	malloc

1018855
contains	elements
i want to create an arrays of all the html elements within a div that contains text strings such as

1018862
show	next
navigates to the next page or clears the data â you do not need to do anything as the scripting will automatically show the warning messages

1018869
getter	setter
as far a possible create everything as an object with properties that have getter where you hide complexity and setter only if they can t be readonly

1018869
oracle	mysql
keep the sql as simple as possible -i move my last .app from oracle to mysql in 2 days - 150 tables with related object and edit frame

1018881
alloca	malloc
however if the thing you want to alloc using alloca is reasonably small i think that it s a good technique that s faster and more convenient than using malloc or otherwise

1018884
internet-explorer	opera
how do you fix the site if it doesn t look right to opera or internet-explorer 6 users and there s no make site 100 compatible menu item

1018884
notepad++	textpad
notepad++ is a good choice and .so is textpad

1018890
digits	base
since decimal are just base 10 floats you actually have a lot of digits available

1018898
multiplication	division
this is also the reason why it has actually become incorrect to state that relational-division is the relational inverse of cartesian product as real-number division is the inverse of real-number multiplication

1018902
perl	php
you should look into php sql database programming and perl

1018927
ordinals	numeric
each unicode character in a string is defined by a unicode scalar value also called a unicode code points or the ordinals numeric value of the unicode character

1018939
contains	elements
i am not sure what you mean by no interdependent top nodes or tag checked but assuming under the root elements you have millions of top level elementss contains object properties or rows that each need to be kept together as a unit and you wanted say 1 million per output file you could do this

1018942
treeview	listview
i have an old vb6 application that uses an imagelist control from comctl32.ocx windows common-controls 5.0 sp2 to provide icons for treeview and listview

1018949
button	popup
i want to show a popup onclientclick of a button

1018950
entity-framework	ado.net
yes the ado.net entity-framework has been release with .net 3.5 service pack 1

1018955
entity-framework	ado.net
according to the ado.net team late last year .net 4.0 will be the official points where they are recommending phasing out linq-to-sql in favor of the entity-framework

1018955
entity-framework	data-access
weâ re making significant investments in the entity-framework such that as of .net 4.0 the entity-framework will be our recommended data-access solution for linq to relational scenarios.

1018971
right-join	having
additional problem if you decide to switching from an inner-join to say a right-join having the conditional be inside the join could lead to unexpected results

1018981
instances	destroy
is it possible to reconfigure the existing autocomplete instances or will i have to somehow destroy and recreate

1018988
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
also i don t like the automatic borders created .when opening the spreadsheet in excel or openoffice.org on linux

1019002
temporary	copy
.sometimes i copy files to a temporary location .so i can include everything plausible in one step and exclude .some specific items in a later step

1019002
temporary	copy
you don t seem to need the temporary files but inorder to transform some text files to pc line ending before building an install i copy and convert everything using fixcrlf relevant to a temporary directory and then pick and choose files for different platform from the created hierarchy

1019004
fwrite	fread
if its just pod plain old data w o pointers then you can just fwrite and fread

1019008
formatting	printing
firstobject s 605k downloading lightweight native windows free xml editor opens a 50mb file in 1.3 seconds and provides text editing search syntax-colored printing plus treeview and additional xml features including formatting and full-blown cmarkup scripting built-in

1019017
gridview	listview
how to show in the wpf listview using the gridview an empty text like in asp.net please selected a person or 0 items founded

1019027
any	set
it probably isn t pdo that s causing it but on the other hand it s possible because any client can set sql mode for its session

1019030
spring	guice
we are currently using guice for our di needs but i see i can get similar features from the spring containers as well

1019037
perl	awk
use flat-file transformation extraction all the data into flat-files manipulate them using grep awk sed c perl into the required insert updates statements and execute those against the target database

1019040
factors	primes
i tried to use primes factors and divisors of n but i always get something that doesn t work with larger n

1019046
factors	primes	factorization	factors	factorization	primes
obviously factorization is still not a trivial problem but even sqrt n trial divisions enough to find all the primes factors beats the heck out of n-1 applications of euclid s algorithm

1019060
selected	cell
with the r1c1 reference styles off i recorded a macros in which cell a2 is initially selected

1019063
coalesce	isnull
second do you have a lot of code that is using isnull or coalesce which you need to updates these things slow performance .so if you no longer need to checked for them you should change the code

1019063
put	get
sometimes people will put in bad information to allow them to get rid of nulls

1019063
value	field
.so now the price field needs to contains decimal value and things like unknown and thus can t properly be a decimal datatype and then you have to go to all .sorts of lengths inorder to do calculations

1019063
value	field
plus you need to go through all your code and where ever you used a refernce to the field being null or not being null you need to rewrite to exclude or include based on the possible bad value someone will put in becasue the data is not allowed to be null

1019082
qmainwindow	qwidget
maybe i m missing something here but have you tried subclassing the qmainwindow class and overrides the qwidget event methods to always return false

1019083
subtract	add
i know how to add or subtract some other that-kind of variables

1019083
subtract	time
i know i can subtract n time but maybe there are more better solutions

1019093
hide	show
this uses a manual tooltip and timer to show hide a caption .when the mouse move over the title bar

1019101
constructor	object
it s done to avoid a third party site hijacking your data using a tag and overrides the object constructor to grab the data as it is built

1019118
activerecord	datamapper
i was trying to separate my dal from my business layer and in doing .so i decided to eschew any activerecord approach and go for a datamapper approach

1019136
rhino-mocks	moq
the fake object can easily be mocked using a mocking framework like rhino-mocks or moq or you can just implements a fake one yourself

1019164
bazaar	git
for the dvcs we re considering mercurial bazaar and git

1019204
iprincipal	iidentity
i am using .net s iidentity and iprincipal object for role based security and i am at the step of modifying controls show based on roles the current user has

1019205
virtual-machine	virtualbox
if you use virtualbox over linux then you can use the remote-desktop protocols to run and control the virtual-machine remotely

1019205
virtual-machine	virtualbox	remote-desktop	rdp
virtualbox supports the standards remote-desktop protocols where a virtual-machine can act as an rdp server allowing you to run the virtual-machine remotely on some thin client that merely display the rdp data

1019206
contains	lookup
on the other hand if your database contains over 100 000+ document you may want to look seriously at dividing the data into multiple nsf s - at that numbers of document you need to be very careful about your view design your lookup code etc

1019214
basic	vba
it sounds like you want something a little more automatic though i m not sure why but fortunately outlook is easy to automate using visual basic for applications vba

1019215
bazaar	git
if you choose a dvcs mercurial bazaar -- or git since it works really well on windows you would not be able to get the same inherited effect -- .when you are selecteded different versioning with different successive selected rules -- as said in that answer

1019215
administration	account
what must be taken into account is the administration in terms of user access

1019234
contains	elements
this versioning will not return parent elements that contains the elements having texts only the last level elements

1019252
contains	any
would not contains any redundancies and resharper should not complain

1019259
web-hosting	hosting
asp.net web-hosting tends to be far more expensive than vanilla linux hosting and required more control over the server environment

1019261
subtract	time
i know i can subtract n time but maybe there are more better solutions

1019261
subtract	time
subtract n time may be slow .when n is large

1019281
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
windows uses completely different data-structures to implements exception-handling on 32-bit vs 64bit and on itanium vs x86

1019283
contains	any
if for whatever reason this is not possible you could overrides any numbers of methods onload onprerender createchildcontrols etc. to add some logic where you move any child controls that were added to your base control s control collections to an updatepanel control that your control contains

1019296
subtract	add
3 subtract shifted divisor from dividend and add one to result

1019305
datapager	datalist
you could try a datalist along with a datapager bound to your ods

1019305
datapager	datalist
the datalist is similar to a repeater in that you have to explicit declare the emitted markup but offers more robust paging capabilities especially along with the datapager control

1019343
google-earth	google-maps
it would work similar to google-maps street view or google-earth

1019344
streamreader	streamwriter
for that reason i consider streamwriter and streamreader which does the same thing to be among the very few classes where if it implements idisposable you should call dispose is wrong

1019344
buffering	streaming
otherwise you could have data still being buffering in memory that never makes it to the output streaming

1019357
display	width
for width i m not a designer but i ve read that 960px width is the way to go these days because it lends itself to being divided into columns that look nice and fits nicely within most display

1019359
subtract	addition	subtract	add	subtraction	addition
you can do addition and subtraction of arbitrarily large binary object using the assembler looping and add subtract with carry adc sbb instructions

1019383
directory	folder
i was wondering if it was possible to bind some filenames in a given directory of the clientbin folder to a combobox

1019389
factors	primes	unique	words	multiplication	exponent
in other words fully factors the numbers into unique primes and exponent and do a simple multiplication from there

1019392
put	get
well get rid of the quotes then trim then put the quotes back

1019393
double	int
there s an identical question here in c# convert string to nullable int double etc...

1019406
emacs	vim
despite being a vim user i m interested in starting to learn emacs

1019406
emacs	vim
however whenever i start to follow the emacs tutorial i end up hitting vim cmd by accident and get frustrated with it

1019413
any	set
the cookies will typically be include in any types of request but the scenario you describe is what s known as a third-party cookies that is the cookies is set on a domain that is different than the domain of the loaded page and most browsers offer a privacy setting to block third-party cookiess

1019414
data-access	ado.net
i don t want to go back to traditional ado.net data-access

1019417
emacs	vim
the duration and intensity of the vim versus emacs debate suggests rather strongly that both editor are about equals in their usefulness

1019419
32-bit	16-bit	32-bit	64bit
if your processor or your c libs has a fast 64bit divide you can break the 128bit divide into pieces the same way you d do a 32-bit divide on processor that had 16-bit divisions

1019428
updating	updates
timestamp should show the data .when the recording was updates and you should compare timestamps of the recording with same ids to decide if you need updating it or not

1019432
order	join
the first will give you only those recording that have an order dated later than may 15 2009 thus converting the left join to an inner-join

1019433
solaris	linux
linux and solaris multi-language ide has perl support including

1019433
cygwin	gnu
research purposes cygwin is covered by the gnu public license but

1019433
contains	set
contains in addition to the shell a comprehensive set of standards

1019441
exception-handling	try-catch
you could add try-catch around the convertfrominvariantstring but to be honest i d rather have the code throw an exception-handling if i give it something stoopid - leave nulls for the blank case

1019448
contains	any
because a cachedrowset object stores data in memory the amount of data that it can contains at any one time is determined by the amount of memory available

1019448
populate	row
.when this code runs crs will be populate with four rows from rshandle starting with the tenth row

1019457
python	c++
i m writing a little python extension in c++ and i ve got a function like this

bmp	gif
is there any image-processing tool to convert .svg scalability vector-graphics files to any other common widely used image format such as jpeg gif bmp etc

1019463
relational-database	schema
is anyone aware of a vendor neutral xsd to describe a relational-database schema

1019465
emacs	vim
i don t have any experience with this i use vim but vimpulse is an emacs scripting to emulate vim as apposed to viper-mode which emulates vi

1019487
configuration	environment	required	checked
checked your configuration environment test.rb and configuration environment development.rb to see if you do something funny with required

1019508
jquery	dojo	scriptaculous	dojo	scriptaculous	jquery
if you haven t it s probably a browser compatibility issue - i would try jquery dojo or scriptaculous because they work smoothly with common browsers

1019518
nsmutablearray	nsarray	defined	declare
note that even if you declare the properties types to be nsarray the object returned is still an nsmutablearray and the mutable methods are defined for it

1019521
constructor	object
also a constructor is as its named states a methods for initializer the object this in your case is not done

1019524
value	field
this is good documentation on how to cast sql char 1 field with n or y value to ms-access oooops i meant jet yes no field

1019555
parsing	comma
first .when parsing string value that use a comma to indicate the decimal place this methods doesn t work

1019564
nsmutablearray	nsarray
.so this is really to do with the synthesize call that is not happy about exposing a nsmutablearray as an nsarray - why not just implements the getmethod

1019564
nsmutablearray	nsarray
actually thinking about it it must be the set methods that is not happy - you wouldn t be able to set an nsarray into an nsmutablearray

1019566
xsd	xml
it display a section on how a table would be exported as as xml and the xsd that would support it which looks rather generics

1019567
any	set
i m sitting in the debugger at line 2485 in some one eases code and realize that the program needs to right here set the foobat properties on the enclosing wizbang object the one that the function 27 step up the call stack was called on but i don t have any direct references to the enclosing wizbang object

1019573
floppy	hdd
i m working on a project where the user is able to save their work most likely to the hdd but also possibly any other media including floppy disks

1019580
sql-server	oracle
you would almost have to have .some kind of a neutralized versioning with adaptor for each individual database systemd you want to target - even just to map all the various data types varchar and nvarchar in sql-server varchar2 in oracle and .so on

1019594
getter	setter
properties specially automatic properties in .net 3.5 are more concise than setter getter and less lines-of-code less code to maintain less bugs

1019606
revision	updates
i suppose .when you triggers the building it performs an updates and logs a messegs like at revision xxx but without any changes

1019626
perl	php
php perl and other languages all have libs that can be used to edit excel files programmatically

1019643
tuples	set
right now i have a progression from a set of tuples for each row in the table to a histogram count the frequencies of the appearances of the tuples of interest to a serialization that -- somewhat clumsily -- compiles the output into a set of table cell for display

1019645
required	checked
in c# a properties may not be reducible to a single field-get or field-set for example it may required additional checked or there may be caching involved or any numbers of reasons

1019647
getter	setter
maybe a minor points but with getter setter i find it annoying that .when i m cycling through them in an ide with intellisense there s a massive block of getter next to each other and another block of setter

1019649
reflection	runtime
properties are a runtime supported methods of exposing a pair of get set methodss that have metadata support which means they are discoverable using reflection without guessing what methodss are supposed to form the accessor based on methods named and signature

1019649
getter	setter
in the case of properties it doesn t mater if there is ambiguity between a function-call and field access because for the greatest part you don t pay the function-call cost properties getter and setter because of their simplicity are high candidates for inlining which means that cost wise the are closer to field than function-calls

1019659
attributes	properties
by exposing something as properties you re implying that you re quickly fetching putting an attributes on an object

1019663
implicit-conversion	return-type
try forcing an implicit-conversion to nodeseq by specifing it as return-type

1019665
motion	tilt
i would also like to implements shake for a random page but cannot figure out how to do the logic for differentiating a shake motion and a x-axis tilt

1019678
postgresql	mysql
therefore postgresql and mysql developers don t get feel the need to improve it

1019699
jndi	jmx

1019699
jndi	jmx
info started jmxconnector jmxservice url service jmx rmi jndi rmi randys-laptop 8686 jmxrmi

1019724
macros	vba
you can write a macros in vba to handle doing this

1019740
multiplication	exponent
but if that s why it s .so much slower why doesn t it perform a checked for an int exponent and then just do the multiplication

1020038
emacs	vim
as you probably know from learning vim vim and emacs fluency comes only with tons of practice until the cmd become second-nature

1020038
emacs	vim
it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa

1020038
emacs	vim
after a while you start to compartmentalize the two mentally and you probably won t have much difficulty though i still occasionally wq emacs and c- vim it doesn t happen often enough to be a problem

1020038
emacs	vim
a lot of the terminology and functionality of vim and emacs is similar but just different enough to make it all confusing

1020038
emacs	vim
much like h is indispensable in vim the emacs help systemd is a great boon in navigating emacs enormous set of built-in cmd

1020038
emacs	vim
emacs will never be as good a vim as vim

1020038
emacs	vim
the emacs way of doing things is very different but it has strengths and weaknesses of its own compared to the vim set of key-bindings

1020038
emacs	vim
nowadays i have borrowed a bunch of emacs shortcuts and mapped them in vim and vice versa

1020038
emacs	vim
.when not if emacs starts to make you foam at the mouth in rage take a break hop into vim and come back later

1020038
emacs	vim
you aren t going to forget vim and replace it in your brain with emacs

1020038
emacs	vim
if you know vim and you learn emacs then you will know both

1020203
json	xml
it might be because you are requesting json results instead of xml via your web service datatype json

1020214
inline-assembly	assembly
inline-assembly is typically the easiest way to incorporate assembly into a program

1020214
inline-assembly	assembly
for compilers that do not support inline-assembly or .when you want to contains all machine specific code you typically separate the assembly specific portions into their own files exposing the assembly code as functions that your c++ code can call

1020468
any	set
i ve set up a servlet at designer that output the request header and body from any page request

1020479
base-class	inherited
i think the points of inherited in python is not to make the code compile it is for the real reason of inherited which is extends the class into another child class and to overrides the logic in the base-class

1020482
data-members	constructor
it gets even clearer if the ancestry class has a data-members for example number_of_legs that is used by non-abstract methods in the ancestry like print_number_of_legs but is initiated in the descendant class constructor dog would initializer it with 4 whereas snake would initializer it with 0

1020483
hide	show
the usual solution is to show hide them as appropriate

1020484
.net	wcf

1020638
asp.net-mvc	webforms
now i am wondering if it was possible to mix asp.net-mvc and classic webforms i don t want to reimplement what i ve already done even if this makes the code non-homogeneous...

1020643
asp.net-mvc	webforms
yes it s perfectly possible to mix webforms and asp.net-mvc

building your own wcf soap-based service which implements the asp.net-mvc pattern

1020652
.net	wcf
you may consider the wcf-rest support that comes out-of-the-box in .net 3.5 or the wcf-rest starter kit which building on the out-of-the-box rest support in wcf to give you some extra features

1020666
asp.net-mvc	webforms
now going back to asp.net-mvc i feel i can do things much easier in webforms

1020671
ienumerator	ienumerable
pass an ienumerator string rather than the ienumerable string by calling getenumerator

1020678
contains	any
you could still perform pretty much any calculation by having methods take object contains all the value they needs for their calculations and then returning new object with the result maybe a new instances of the same object even

1020678
dictionary	map
this is not a suggested solution but the easiest way to see that this will always work is that you could store these immutable value into a map dictionary hashtable like structure keyed by a variables named

1020682
canvas	scale
.when resize the browser windows the flash movie doesn t scale proportionately to the div only the photo does leaving a blank canvas black while the div height stays the same

1020708

eventually you will probably develop a preferences for scheme or common-lisp but they both have enough difference that it s best to get a handle on everything that s out there

1020708
common-lisp	scheme
scheme has continuations for example and it s good to learn about those in scheme even though they can be implements in common-lisp

1020708
common-lisp	elisp
learning the difference between lexical and dynamic-scope is important and if you learn both common-lisp and elisp you ll come across the implications of both

1020709

1020730
schtasks	cmd
not sure what versioning of windows you are on but from reading the other question it looks like schtasks on vista server 2008 does not provide a cmd option that would allow you to specify a start-in directory directly

1020735
contains	any
any systemd of a decent size probably should contains at least half of clisp

1020740

put x in get y out

1020740
put	get
now you put in a value of 3 in and you get a value of 6 out

1020749
protected	public
what are public private and protected in object oriented programming

1020754
semantics	keyword
they aren t really concepts but rather specific keyword that tend to occur with slightly different semantics in popular languages like c++ and java

1020754
protected	public
broadly speaking public means everyone is allowed to access private means that only members of the same class are allowed to access and protected means that members of subclassing are also allowed

1020766
any	set
since the change set that removes the file maintains what the file s file id file named and parent directory were files can be restored at any time without having to load them into the systemd again

streamcm runs on a variety of platform - unix solaris aix hp-ux irix etc. linux red hat fedora gentoo etc. windows-xp vista and on macos powerpc and intel

1020775
postgresql	mysql
the database would be postgresql or mysql

1020778
controllers	routes
also note that this uses restful routes new_building_path rather than specifying the controllers and the action

1020784
arguments	default
i ve set a default for the event handler arguments .so you can call that function withouth

1020806
scheme	lisp
this is no doubt why the-little-schemer was translation from lisp into scheme

1020812
apache	vhosts
the key points here are to provide a distinct servername in this case the domains staging.sitename.com and www.sitename.com as well as provide a distinct pythoninterpreter configuration setting in your apache vhosts configuration file

1020815
base-class	inherited
the object i m converting from all inherited from the same base-class .so part of the conversion is always the same

1020820

1020822
postgresql	mysql
pyqt4 s qtsql module in particular supports mysql postgresql and several other databases

1020828
jaxp	jdom

1020828
dom4j	jdom
jon doe suggested dom4j and jdom

1020829
updating	updates
i was wondering if there is any tool which indexes a specified folder in my case project folder and updates in real-time with updating codes

also using mylyn allows you to migrate your tasks to real back-end .when you re ready like bugzilla trac mantis etc

1020848
dom4j	jdom
dom4j or jdom are probably the most elegant you can write code how you like it

1020860
mongodb	couchdb
well indexes are also much harder in distribute databases and document databases like mongodb couchdb etc

1020862
functional-programming	imperative
the trick with functional-programming is being able to recognize patterns particular variables assignments and move the imperative state to stack

1020862
contains	any
not a single snippet of code contains any mutable state

1020862
stateless	stateful
stateless programming is just as expressive and powerful as stateful programming it just required a little practice to train yourself to start thinking statelessly

1020862
stateless	stateful
of course stateless programming .when possible stateful programming where necessary seems to be the motto of most impure functional languages

1020871
python	c++
if you need to inherited the implementation then python is not .so different than statically typed oo languages like c++

1020885
fadein	hide	fadeout	fadein
also there are other ways to hide and reveal elements such as fadein and fadeout

1020888
ruby-on-rails	django	ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
i have experienced some codeigniter django and ruby-on-rails before but i can t pinpoint that specific framework

1020891
google-chrome	safari
testing in google-chrome or safari

1020910
constructor	object
maybe get into constructor how to initializer the object s definitions and destructor freeing the memory file handles connections it s holding

1020916
linux	unix
it is also still maintained thanks to cheap labor students at berkeley open-source and very portable i ve run it on various flavors of unix including linux and various processor architectures as well

1020952
buffering	streaming
it s essentially a buffering streaming algorithm that at any given line knows the difference of all previous line

1020970
value	field
where the id field should not be autoincremented while enterting the null value and should be autoincremented while entering value insert value in the same row while giving not null value

1020973
show	next
the code is doing the following finding the menu showing it finding all the and hiding them binding a custom event called show which slowly show the elements and once it is fully show looks to see if there are any next to it and triggers the same event for that elements

1020981
contains	any
i wouldn t expect you to be able to get the trace-back to be any better though because the code is actually contains in a comment block and then process

1020991
shell	bash
wxpython how to create a bash shell windows

1020991
shell	bash
there i have given a full fledged integration with bash shell

reading stdout and stderr and communication via stdin

1020991
shell	bash
that is a complete wxpython .app mimicking bash shell partially

1020994
python	ruby
i ve met a similar distinction in python unified namespace vs ruby distinct namespaces for methods vs non-methods

1020994
common-lisp	scheme
however my lisp-oid experience is was mostly with scheme rather than common-lisp .so i may be subconsciously biased by the familiarity with the uniform namespace that in the end comes from that experience

1020997
common-lisp	scheme
a lisp-1 has a single namespace for both variables and functions as in scheme while a lisp-2 has separate namespaces for variables and functions as in common-lisp

1020997
common-lisp	scheme
lisp-1 refers to scheme s model and lisp-2 refers to common-lisp s model

1021019
value	field
it sounds like you need to generator the value for the id field yourself in your own code rather than having the database generator it

1021023
duplicates	elements
then .when i append the resulting html to an existing dom elements on the client side quite obviously there are duplicates hidden input-field with the same named and id resulting in the view state corruption

1021027
arrays	loops
instead of iterator over the arrays loops would do nothing

1021032
arrays	loops
and that show the reason why this feature is useful a pointers points at the non-existent elements after the end of the arrays is useful for comparisons such as in loops

multicast	packets
their is a special handshake at the switching level its telling the switching you are part of the multicast grouping .so that you will al.so receive the packets

1021044
multicast	packets
what you need to do is join the multicast grouping then just recv the packets and write them to a file then i would assume the mpeg2 mpeg4 or however the streaming is sent will be a file on your machine that should be playable through another program

1021052
lookup	any
lookup this prefix in a database-table and load any information you need to about the user or other information to do with this prefix

1021077
versioning	upgrade
there are some very few obscure breaking changes .when you upgrade to later versioning of the framework usually due to the use of deprecated apis or non-standard methods

1021081
exception-handling	try-catch
in general i think it is always good practice to have catch all try-catch blocks high up in the call stack that can catch general exception-handling throwable and then report these nicely to the user - perhaps with an interface that will then email the error and stack-trace to the development team and ask for user comments

1021085
index-error	valueerror
for example .when parsing a file in python some string list and dictionary operations may raise valueerror index-error or keyerror

1021109
simulator	platform
you still need to run platform dependant functionality testing on simulator but you can do it in one application which would be a set of unit tests like chrisw already said

1021114
managed-code	unmanaged
basically the same rules that apply to where .config files need to be for pure managed apps apply to unmanaged apps that load managed-code

1021131
boost	stl
for general purpose boost is best of breed and don t forget about the good old stl .so i don t see the points of looking for .something else that will cover much of the same ground but is not as polished

1021209
keyboard	mouse
the input structures can either be a mouse or keyboard event

1021217
canvas	scale
it will still scale with the width but will show canvas background like in the linked examples

endpoint	uri
no .soap actions are just uri strings .so you need to populate the handler mapping with a propertyset of uri key to endpoint beans named

1021238
keyboard	mouse
here is how you simulate input both mouse and keyboard

1021246
flac	mp3
flac stands for free lossless audio codec an audio format similar to mp3 but lossless meaning that audio is compressed in flac without any loss in quality

1021246
flac	mp3
this is similar to how zip works except with flac you will get much better compression because it is designed specifically for audio and you can play back compressed flac files in your favorite player or your car or home stereo see supported devices just like you would an mp3 file

1021267
quirks-mode	doctype
use a doctype declaration if you aren t already to force ie into standards-compliant mode well as standards compliant as ie can be instead of quirks-mode

1021276
mp3	wma
xiph the people behind ogg vorbis have published a comparison between the leading codecs rm mp3 wma aac and ogg - you can listen and compare each of the codecs

1021279
contains	any
i don t think the files you mentioned will contains any references to the versioning of .net they were building under not unless they feature versioning-specific code functionality linq for 3.0+

1021281
contains	elements
.so how can i make a variables that contains a path through the arrays elements

1021287
required	checked
a corrupt installation checked the rubygems.rb file and make sure it required rubygems default operating_system

1021289
contains	elements
if its asp.net project checked the assemblies elements in web-config its must contains versioning of each assembly you use

1021303
arrays	loops
.so there is never a need to generator the string you just use a loops to seek the right arrays

1021306
contains	elements
i have a list elements contains a numbers of between 20-30 events

1021306
show	next
i only want to show 5 of those and have a â moreâ link i can click to watch the the next five

there s a tutorial written by johannes fahrenkrug from march 2009 which covers deploying ruby-on-rails to solaris 10 with passenger and ruby-enterprise-edition

1021345
put	get
put that in a for-loops to loops the color from 0 to 15 and you will get kids excited about programming

1021348
boolean	int
the mechanism which has the test on one line doesn t have that issue but generally it would be better to separate the test into a function which takes an int representing a year and returns a boolean representing whether or not the year is a leap year

1021356
arguments	undefined
in the c99 standards the former means undefined numbers of arguments while the latter means no arguments

the subnav1 list wasn t contains within a elements

1021386
textbox	button
i have an asp.net form which has 3 textbox and and a asp.net link button control.i want to invoke the button click event handler methods .when the user press enter key.i used asp.net panels and its default button property.its working in ie.but not in other browsers like firefox etc

1021397
actioncontroller	helpers
my conclusion was that you can have the configuration in-place but you need to work with front-controller plugins or actioncontroller helpers

1021397
actioncontroller	helpers
from the helpers you can then load the actioncontroller and on that execute the getinvokeargs to load the bootstrap

1021404
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
any relational-database will do mysql postgresql sqlite oracle sql-server - pick one

i have been using the jeditable plugins for jquery and i would like to return errors to the plugins to instruct it to revert to the previous value and also display an error to the user

1021444
google-chrome	firefox
after trying jitters suggestion and getting it working in ie8 i realised the issue was with firefox and google-chrome .when i click the button only

1021444
value	field
if an error is received that portion execute the text value gets reverted to the original however i cannot then click the field again jeditable has been unbound it seems

1021447
attributes	properties
i need to find the attributes range 0 255 reflecting only on the properties bar.fooprop

1021464
getter	setter
i m changing some classes of mine from an extensive use of getter and setter to a more pythonic use of properties

1021464
getter	setter
but now i m stuck because some of my previous getter or setter would call the corresponding methods of the base-class and then perform something else

1021464
getter	setter
how to call the properties getter or setter in the parent class

1021470
web.py	django
for server-side actually almost every web framework web.py django etc. has its own form generator as well as validation .lib for you to use

1021478
csv	xml
that said here s a sample xslt that should translation your xml and present it in a csv format as show above

1021484
attributes	properties
but a properties is just an object with a getter methods to find the corresponding attributes

1021486
export	csv
it s more complex than csv i9mport export but also a bit more robust

1021533
updating	updates
if your updates are relatively free-standing i think it would be sensible to retrieve the row immediately before updating it

1021540
perforce	git
i m not a git or svn user my main experience is with perforce but i ll try and outline some best practices that should work for any large enterprise level scm systemd

1021562

jquery	.post
i am using jquery s .post function to add a list entry to the mysql database in php

1021641
cursor	row
it should reposition the mysql internal cursor to the first row of the result set associated to this- displaylistings

1021658
irony	antlr
you could pick a parsing framework that has a lot of existing grammars like antlr or newer ones like irony and use that

1021663
instances	private
at the same time you should note that the operations i mention are really private to the object instances .so id does not necessarily have to be a public properties

1021669
contentcontrol	itemscontrol
then bind an itemscontrol and the contentcontrol to it to make the contentcontrol always show the currentitem from that list

1021704
python	c++
i wasn t using python at the time it was some other proprietary package in c++

1021716
pthreads	openmp
one other reason the openmp is task-based pthreads is thread based

1021752
arrays	loops
also note as mehrdad pointed out the compilers and jit may choose to optimize a foreach loops for certain known data-structures such as an arrays

1021762
delphi	c++
writing in assembly would take the longest in c less in c++ even less in more modern languages such as c# java delphi even less

1021784
toolchain	platform
that s actually the only way to do it in a purely platform independent way but toolchain specific tricks like hidden attributes for gcc etc.

1021798
authentication	login
hey there im a little bit confused about handling invalid user authentication request at login controllers

1021806
strategy-pattern	decorator
many time the strategy-pattern and decorator are good way to tame variation in domain logic

1021809
nested-class	base-class
create a common base-class that can be both used in the function and implements by the nested-class

1021815
python	lua
many time i have made internal data-structures mutable through python or lua

1021837
.when	ready
what happens is that .when that last td is click the modal opens and the ready function fires

1021848
vbscript	jscript
keep in mind that classic asp include jscript as well as vbscript

1021848
vbscript	jscript
interestingly you can parsing json using jscript and use the resulting object directly in vbscript

1021848
vbscript	jscript
you can access the contents of the jscript arrays from vbscript using dot notation

1021854
filesystems	xfs
among popular filesystems such as ext3 ext4 xfs jfs reiserfs reiser4 etc

1021857
factors	matrix
this one is about highly parallelizable approximate matrix factors suitable for use in kernel methods in machine learning

1021921
put	get
well it is possible to get the string that you need to put into the createquery methods automatically

1021952
pixels	line
style.css line 159 include a line where it makes the images 200 pixels

1021955
selected	listbox
another option is to use a listbox instead of a menu styles the listbox to look like a menu and then you can bind to the selected value like this

1021962
autotools	gnu
i m working on a c++ project on gnu linux and i m looking for a way to test the existence and usability of ibm informix s libs with the autotools - namely editing a configure.in

1021967
linked-list	arrays
right now i have a javascript function that call a web service inorder to get an arrays of named the javascript oncomplete function then takes that arrays and makes it into a linked-list

1021984
queue	fifo
if you have large-files or lots of traffic you could persistent a fifo queue in a database and have a windows service take them out and execute them

1021990
mstest	nunit
for testing frameworks both nunit and mstest are good

1021990
mstest	nunit
there are nunit addins available for vs but they are quite as fully integrated as mstest

1021994
switching	router
.when i run it on a wireless network with the network setup using a wifi router instead of a switching the code doesn t work - it gets stuck on getresponse

1022000
googletest	gmock
i ran into this issue trying to detection googletest and gmock the google unit-testing and object mocking frameworks with autotools and here s what i came up with

1022024
crypt	salt
function char crypt const char key const char salt

1022024
crypt	salt
the crypt function takes a passwd key as a string and a salt character arrays which is describe below and returns a printable ascii string which starts with another salt

1022024
crypt	salt
without a salt an intruder can make a guess run crypt on it once and compare the result with all the passwd

1022024
crypt	salt
with a salt the intruder must run crypt once for each different salt

1022024
crypt	salt
the result-of crypt will be the salt followed by a if the salt didn t end with one followed by 22 characters from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z up to 34 characters total

1022024
crypt	salt
for the des-based algorithm the salt should consist of two characters from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z and the result-of crypt will be those two characters followed by 11 more from the same alphabet 13 in total

1022024
crypt	salt
to verify a passwd against the result-of a previous call to crypt pass the result-of the previous call as the salt

1022024
linux	bsd
1 | md5 linux bsd

1022025
json	xml
the choice of json xml yaml or other format is not important

1022026
getter	setter
java uses getter and setter or accessor and mutators wheras in c# you might be making properties for your classes

1022029
pointers	stack
this will push the value of the instruction pointers to stack .so that you can later return to this positioning in the code and jump to the address of the ini labels

1022029
pointers	stack
it saves the value of some registers on stack and sets up a stack frame by copying stack-pointers esp to the base pointers register ebp

1022029
pointers	stack
if the subroutine has local-variables stack-pointers is decrement to make room for the variables on stack and the base pointers is used to access the local-variables in stack frame

1022030
subtract	time	subtract	add
you can t sum dates but you can subtract them and get a time interval that you can halve and add back to the first date

1022045
contains	elements
that you need a contains elements or

1022045
contains	elements
and can contains the elements mentioned

1022045
contains	elements
contains elements or possibly that

1022051
getter	setter
the fact that some getter don t have a corresponding setter is normals since you might not want every attributes to be both accessed and changed

1022054
python	java
this should work across multiple-languages but will be primarily targeted for java and python

1022064
jruby	mri
the details vary by implementation but i know that at least in jruby and mri 1.8 there is a construct called an include class that is insert in to the inherited chaining of a class .when a module is extended or include

1022065
any	set
i also don t know how to use this expression or set in actionscript 3 i seem couldn t find any complete reference on it just say through php file a multiple variables test1 test2 test3 ... sent by echo how the flash aplication recieved it

1022066
any	set
an interface is a contract specifying a set of methods field and properties which will be available on any implements object

1022083
hashtable	set
if you have a set of strings that you d like to associate with value the standards as3 approach is to use an object as a hashtable

1022104
ruby-on-rails	django
some frameworks i know of that are really easy to get started with are ruby-on-rails django and grok

1022106
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
i don t know why sortedlist and sorteddictionary don t as both would be able to search pretty easily

1022113
contains	set
.so if varnamed is a variables contains a string which should be a variabless named you could set and read that variables like this

1022114
websphere	ibm
but i had a quick look to see if there are any messaging appenders for log4j i use log4net quite often - ibm have an article on a websphere mq jms appender which might be helpful to you

1022117
value	field
if you never intend to have a user edit the sequences field and plan on always calculating it s value on the back end you can exclude it from the form rather than having it hidden

1022135
udp	tcp
it has very small overhead and is mostly used over udp or local unix sockets but may use tcp if you need reliable logging

1022135
python	perl
works for my python perl mostly but it is completely language platform-agnostic like a charm

1022190
bamboo	hudson
we use hudson too and if it wasn t the recession we would probably use bamboo and most of the atlassian product bamboo crucible confluence together with jira

1022220
grouping	sorting
this is called natural sorting where you effectively treat a grouping of digits as a single character

1022225
filtering	sorting
this may also instruct sql-server to filtering on k1 k3 k4 k5 k6 and order on k7 asc in one pass permitting sql-server to streaming the query results without the intermediate step of sorting a million results first

1022235
codeigniter	cakephp
once thing i will tell you is that if you want to streamline your understanding and your efficiency i have found great success with a numbers of asp.net-mvc frameworks codeigniter cakephp etc

1022263
python-imaging-library	matplotlib
i would personally create the image in python-imaging-library using imagedraw s draw.text convert to a numpy arrays usint numpy s asarrays then rendering with matplotlib

1022268
order	join
the join ensures that you get order that have shipments and the conditional ensures that you only get shipments created in the last hour

1022269
dictionary	arrays	dictionary	map	arrays	map
most of us are familiar with the dictionary abstract data types that stores key-value associations whether we call it a map dictionary associativity arrays hash etc

1022269
python	php	dictionary	arrays
for example some languages especially scripting languages such as php and python blur the line between dictionary and arrays and do provide order for dictionary

1022269
python	java
i ve seen linkedhashmap and linkedmap java ordereddictionary .net ordereddictionary flash ordereddict python and ordereddictionary objective-c

1022284
attributes	properties
compiling fails saying error properties booleanproperties with retain attributes must be of object types

1022288

capitalize turns the first character uppercase and the rest of the string lowercase

1022318
build-server	teamcity
build-server teamcity

1022321
publishing	release
i don t just mean publishing but pretty much everything between .when the pure coding is finished and the first versioning is release

1022324
remote-debugging	debugging
even in setups where remote-debugging on a target systemd works well debugging an application on workstation works better

1022334
any	set
either one of these could be set up to call a php or whatever scripting at the time of expiration or it could be just run once an hour each time checked if there are any newly expired entries

1022347
checkbox	listbox
they have their own windowless checkbox control a windowless listbox control

1022348
authentication	login
had a question related to best practices in iphone login authentication using asynchronous nsurlconnection

1022354
expression	brackets
normally this happens to also be the context nodes but the context nodes has special meaning within a nested xpath expression the part in square brackets

1022370
order	join
i think a better solution is two break your images in tile of some known size and then join them back to back in some random order in a new file

1022383
windows-xp	windows
windows implements alpha-blending for selected icons since windows-xp

1022412
stderr	stdout
and the android-emulator writes all stdout stderr text to a file

1022427
order	add
i was wondering what is the easiest way to keep the functionality and just to add order by clause because i have the same syntax on many places.

1022430
order	add
if you are using visual-studio 2008 team suite or i believe one of the tester editions you can create an order test and add all your unit test to that order test

1022438
linux	unix
by the way if you are not using a unix linux systemd but a windows one you could use scheduled-tasks and call a scripting

1022447
checkbox	button
you can drag a button cell configure like a standards checkbox directly onto one of your table columns

1022466
subclassing	inherited
worker ant queen ant drone ant derive from ant and thus exhibit ad-hoc polymorphism where they all derive from the same ant class and exibit subtyping polymorphism inheriteded of the ant class these ants are all a subclassing of the ant class and inherited the 6 legs 2 eyes 3 body segments etc

1022476
decrement	increment
you can do this with a counter increment it for every sent request decrement it as soon data arrives and validation is completed

1022478
contains	any
did you copy any stylesheets which contains styles for the other content

1022505
instances	self
essentially after the little bit of black magic reassigning self.__class__ to a new class object which behaves just like the previous one but has an empty dictionary and no other instancess except this one self anywhere in an old-style class you would assign to self.__magicname__ assign to self.__class__.__magicname__ instead and make sure it s a built-in or staticmethod not a normals python function unless of course in some different case you do want it to receive the self .when called on the instances

1022505
lookup	any
incidentally the in operators on an instances of this blackmagic class is faster as it happens than with any of the previously proposed .solutions -- or at least .so i m measuring with my usual trusty -mtimeit going directly to the built-in methods instead of following normals lookup routes involving inherited and descriptors shaves a bit of the overhead

1022514
put	get
to get the top 5 recordinging of that query but i only want to selected a certain recording is there anything i can put into this query to do that similar to top

1022520
gnome	xfce
i m using gnome now and want to install xfce

1022520
gnome	xfce
nothing complicated but just curious - do all applications install previously on gnome will be also removed or they would work on xfce properly after installing xfce and removing gnome

1022531
binary-compatibility	compatibility
this should help programmers who have trouble managing interface binary-compatibility or who ignore compatibility

1022538
pointers	stack
to use stack for storing an arrays you have to use unsafe code with pointers and stackalloc to allocate desired memory spaces on stack

1022555
selected	button
i don t mean the content but the button you click on to selected a tab

1022565
filtering	grouping
usually that include grouping dataset and such or filtering data by some criterion

1022567
groovy	java
i have a situation where some of my groovy code references my java files but i also have different java files that reference the same groovy code

1022567
groovy	java
.when trying to compile in maven i either need to compile the groovy before or after the java and that won t really work since the groovy code depends on some java files and different java files depend on the groovy code

1022587
python	ruby	python	java
it s not considered a replacement for languages that have ide-s with intellisense support java c# etc. but it s really useful if you want to create programs in a scripting-language like ruby or python

1022589
groovy	java
if you want groovy java code to exist in the same layer then make sure one call the other but they don t both call each other

1022596
pascal	ada
pascal and many of its descendants too - ada modula oberon etc.

1022596
arrays	loops
it only has arrays of characters and you can t copy arrays of characters any more than you can copy arrays of any other types without using a loops or a function-call

1022598
hashmap	arrays	linked-list	tree	linked-list	arrays	linked-list	hashmap
an iterator is used to iterate over the object in a collections be that an arrays linked-list tree hashmap whatever

1022600

since it s a joint compiler it automatically manages your java to groovy and groovy to java dependencies

1022602
groovy	java
it generator java stubs of your groovy code to deal with the types of inter-language referencing you re dealing with

1022624
reliability	scalability
i know .when we move from vss many years ago it was because of reliability and scalability issues that they might have been exposed to as well

1022626
plugins	add-on
good community and plugins add-on

1022630
any	set
if you don t have revision control and can t set any up then placing the old code in a file somewhere not part of the codebase is advisable

1022631
drupal	modx
personally i like drupal modx and concrete5

1022631
drupal	modx
drupal and modx because of their extensibility concrete5 because of its simplicity

1022646
subclassing	nsobject
currently to implements bonjour sharing i create two additional nsobject subclassing transientplaylist and transientsong which implements all of the same methods as their core data counterparts

1022646
persistent	transient
i shouldn t need to double the numbers of model classes just to have transient versioning of my object â not .when i want them to behave exactly the same sans persistent

1022646
persistent	transient
yes the other option is to have an in-memory persistent store which houses all of the entities you want to be transient

1022648
display	width
first your trace display totalmemory truncation the last 3 digits since you re not doing it in the code i assume it s because of the textfield width

1022652
twitter	tweets
think how twitter show the tweets in your feed

1022655
dictionary	arrays
other kinds of collections abstractions arrays collectionss dictionary etc. will be easier to work with

postgresql	mysql
if you decide to switching to mysql or postgresql you can run the following standards cmd to save your database on the windows machine

1022659
postgresql	mysql
and then configure the settings.py on the linux machine for the mysql or postgresql database and run

1022683
decrement	increment
javascript has increment decrement types operators typesof and instanceof additional assignment operators and additional comparison-operators

1022683
firefox	opera
while it isn t yet standards in javascript mozilla s javascript engine and opera s to an extent has supported a similar feature since javascript 1.7 available as part of firefox 2 under the named destructuring assignment

1022683
for-loop	loops
in javascript the body of a for-loop doesn t introduce a new scoping .so any functions declare in loops body all reference the same outer variables

1022694
python	perl
i have a website written in a language different from perl python

1022697
show	next
now lets say you want to get the next 3 comments - you could do a selected where commentid between the last comment id show to the comment id - 3

1022719
margins	padding
and the total of the width border margins and padding will be what is specified for the width

1022719
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox 3.5 and safari 4 support it not sure about ie8 or google-chrome

1022728
click	mouse
i know there is a mouse click event for every control but is there a way to determine .when the mouse click is not on the control

1022734
getter	setter
you don t need to implements all the getter setter you can use__get and __set

1022736
contains	any

python	perl	child-process	spawn
if you re spawn that perl process from your python code as opposed to directly from the webserver there are several ways to set the child-process environment from the python parent process environment depending on what you re using for the spawn

1022796
contains	set
what you need to do is not touch the cell at all but set the object value which for this column will probably be a boolean nsnumber contains either yes or no as the new value of the appropriate properties in your model

1022805
contains	elements
also depending on whether all the elementss need to be absolutely positioning or not you may need to start doing things like specifying the height of the contains elements explicit which is usually undesirable

1022814

the other methods would be to remember all the nsurlconnection s you ve created and compare them against the first parameter of the delegation callback

1022884
parsing	comma
i am working with nsscanner to parsing data that is both comma and line delimited

1022885
arrays	loops
i would like to create an object arrays in c# of undefined length and then populate the arrays in a loops like so.

1022887
postgresql	oracle
i ve trying to streamline an intranet application where some of the data is stored locally on the postgresql database of the intranet server and other related data is stored in our enterprise oracle 10g2r2 database

1022890
arrays	loops
and finally .when loops is done if you need an arrays

1022900
arrays	loops
for example you can loops through the data of your arrays and make use of nsurlrequest to create a url request that complies with the interface of your web service

1022918

see documentation x86 boot.txt link to 2.6.30 s versioning for more detail for the traditional x86 architecture both 32-bit and 64bit including how these variables are passed to the kernel setup code

1022952
frame	width	height	frame
if width and height represent state of the frame then you could refactorize them to field and write getter for them

1022952
modifiers	final
if widht and height are going to be constants after created then you should use the final modifiers

1022970
getter	setter
is there a good no a very good reason to go through all the trouble of using getter and setter for object-oriented languages

1022970
getter	setter
was i just too tired and fell asleep .when someone walked out and said thou shalt write copious amounts of code to obtain getter and setter

1022970
python	java
it seems to be a common occurrence with java less .so with python

1022971
python	java
.when do you choose to create an application in python instead of a static typed purely oo language like c# or java

1022983
getter	setter
some things required public getter and setter like serialization and patterns like the data transfer object pattern

1022985
getter	setter
getter and setter hide your classes data specifics from the users of your classes

1022985
getter	setter
if you don t use getter and setter .when you change your mind about a data-members you break your classes interface and must alter the rest of your codebase to conform to the change

1022985
getter	setter
if you wrap your properties in getter and setter you can make those changes and hide them from consuming code by modifying the getter and setter methods

1022995
getter	setter
getter and setter are one aspects of implements the open close principles

1022995
getter	setter
they are .so important that c# went through the trouble to make basic getter and setter easy to write

1023009
python	php

it works fine in firefox but it crash safari the first time it tries to set the background-color in the if-statement

1023020

dynamic-sql can open up the risk of sql-injection attacks and as noted in the curse and blessings of dynamic-sql there are also more subtle gotchas to watch out for

1023066
parentheses	braces	malloc	free
your habit of ending something that you started - whether it be the closing parentheses brackets braces or the .close call to match .open or delete free call to match your new malloc - is an excellent one

1023066

the direct answer to your question most good programmer editor can be customized configure .so you ll just have to do .some reading about advanced configuration of the editor of your choice - vim emacs the visual-studio editor

1023091
interpreter	runtime
it is interpreter at runtime from the scripting files themselves rather than being compiled into an assembly

1023091
constructor	object
you can then create the icons object by passing the icons filename to the system.drawing.icons constructor

1023095
perl	php
i m using console_getopt in php 5.2 and finding it surprising about how different it is from getopt in other languages perl bash java

1023095

i wonder why php s getopt isn t like perl s where the arrays s key is the flag eg opts a

1023101
droppable	draggable
if you re working on a rich interactive user-interface you ll find jquery user-interface integration such as draggable droppable resizable etc to be a handy base to buser-interfacelding upon

1023103
double	int
but as i continue my exploration of c# i notice that int double float in c# has some inheriteded hierarchy as they inherited from

1023109
difference	count
continue doing .so until you ve found a numbers of these items equals to the difference between your read count and google s or until the downloading get unrea.sonable

1023110
python	c++	python	java
my motto is and has long been python where i can c++ where i must one day i ll find opportunity to actually use java c# c c in a real-world project but i haven t yet except for a pilot project in java 1.1 more tha ten years ago..

1023110
python	c++	python	java
- -- javascript with dojo .when code has to run in the client s browser and sql .when it has to run in the db server of course but c++ and python are my daily bread on the normals servers and clients i develop and that s the case in all parts of google i ve been working in in 4+ years there are many parts using java too i just never happened to work there

1023110
python	c++
neither python nor c++ are strictly oo -- they re multi-paradigm and therein lies a good part of their strength in the hands of programmers who are highly skilled at oo and other paradigms such as functional generics declarative and .so forth

1023110
python	ruby
otherwise the extremely high productivity of python and ruby or javascript aren t all that different if that s what you are used to makes it preferable

1023119
macports	fink
you should already have libcurl mine is at usr bin libcurl which you can use to get the fink or macports downloading

1023132
value	field
going down this route will also reduce risk to your .app if for some reason java decides to change the constants value for these vk_ field

1023146
python	ruby
coming from a python background where there is always a right way to do it a pythonic way .when it comes to styles i m wondering if the same exists for ruby

1023164
arrays	loops
.when iterator over an arrays for each loops are way faster in my tests

1023164
while-loop	arrays
here probably most of while-loop time is spent casting the arrays item to a numbers

1023175
selected	cell
the rowstring is a string whose value is the same as the text in the selected cell i ve tested it it is accurate

1023181
hardware	monitor
it doesn t seem to do software monitor only using hardware can it snoop

1023187
python	php	web-applications	webserver
our web-applications are written in php and or python using apache as the webserver

1023187
python	php
question what is the best way to communication between c# and php python using http

1023187
python	php
ideally we would have strongly typed struct or object to work with in c# and appropriate data-structures created in php python to work with on that end

1023188
frame	width	height	frame
if what you need is the width and height of the frame in the circle why not pass the drawframe width and height into the drawcircle constructor

1023193
contains	any
the actual domain mondel and business-logic for the application is currently pretty thin .so the category fund and role object do not contains any business-logic and are really just means of categorisation access-control etc in the case of roles etc.

1023193
constructor	object
it means therefore that i have to possibly maintain mapping object within the application to get the category role fund ids for a given category rle fund to pass to the constructor of the category role fund object

1023199
contains	elements
however if the click is on an li that contains a nested ul i of course get the text of all elements

1023220
python	php
i have no real experience with php but i ve done plenty of python back-end web-services consumed by front-end clients in a variety of languages and environment

1023220
json	xml
once you have your web .app set up to emit say a protocols buffering it s not hard at all to make it able to emit xml or json on request - one

1023220
python	php
outputformat json extra parameter in the get request is all it takes and picking the right output serialization is trivially easy in python but i m sure in php as well

1023220
python	java	json	xml
i know it wouldn t be any harder for json or xml and i very much doubt it would be any harder for java c# python if you cared or any other language that s any use at all in the real world

1023223
reflection	runtime
in the linqtolucene stuff i ve written custom-attributes are nice because they allow you to find through reflection specific field at runtime

1023227
utility	manual
i m somewhat confused by the php manual on pcre and while i ll try to find more info on pcre i was wondering if anyone had designed such a utility

1023244
extends	final
rather you make a list of string pieces with append or extends or list comprehensions c and .when you re all done you join it up for the final string result with .join thelist or the like

1023251
constructor	private
this is not possible as the copy constructor are private

1023278
constructor	object
change your constructor signature for drawcircle to take in a drawframe object

1023278
constructor	object
within the constructor set the class variables d to the drawframe object you just took in

1023283
authentication	login
that file not only provides a nice user-interface to try your configuration it contains all the authentication primitive that we use in the framework to login

1023284
dictionary	map
from what i understand a map is a dictionary that has additional rules including order

1023302
fckeditor	wysiwyg
tinymce and fckeditor are the top two wysiwyg editor in terms of popularity

1023319
difference	factors
in practice a log factors difference in sorting time is probably insignificant -- sort can sort hundreds of thousands of line in a few seconds

1023328
openoffice.org	uno
you might be able to achieve what you need it with a recent versioning of openoffice.org too using the uno api

1023331
double	int
btw i wouldn t use float ever and float i would avoid as well as it only accurate to 6 places i would suggest using int long or double

1023333
glassfish	weblogic	glassfish	geronimo	weblogic	geronimo
i suppose that .when you said i had made my project in j2ee you mean an enterprise application which runs on a j2ee server such as glassfish jboss weblogic geronimo etc

1023355
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
i can checked whether my text.substring i i + interval contains any n and split till there but the problem is to get the remaining characters after n till next 15 or till next n and set proper order and subtext

1023375
icollection	ienumerable
i know that the ilist already inheriteded from icollection and ienumerable .so why does arraylist redundantly inherited from these interfaces

1023383
python	java
python is much more strictly oo than java and c#

1023383
python	java
but if your question is .when to use python and .when java or c# i find python useful for small programs that building on existing libs and don t involve much domain model

1023383
elementtree	lxml
for example little desktop utilities written with the python gtk binding or website maintenance scripting written with lxml and elementtree

1023383
python	java
.when there is a lot of application domain model to do especially if the domain is poorly understood or changing rapidly i find python limited tooling makes changing the code very arduous compared to java not .so relevant for c# because .net tool support trails java by a few years

1023390
icollection	ienumerable
if you implements ilist you must also implements icollection and ienumerable

1023421
postgresql	oracle
to connect from oracle to postgresql this forum can also help

1023429
versioning	migrate
i was just thinking maybe the updates process is nice enough to migrate the preferences to the new versioning

1023432
icollection	ienumerable
by implements it in arraylist it becomes easy for one to know - which interfaces arraylist implements rather that going up to ilist to find that it implements icollection ienumerable

1023432
icollection	ienumerable
the class derived from ilist hence indirectly implements icollection ienumerable as well

1023432
icollection	ienumerable
.so even if you write your own class implements ilist and not add icollection ienumerable in the declaration - you will see that it will have to provide the implementation for icollection ienumerable

1023440
curly-braces	parentheses
however i try not to be religious about it with blocks curly-braces and do end have different precedence and rather than adding explicit parentheses to disambiguate an expression i just switching to the other styles

1023473
order	join
.someone already mentioned that you don t need to send a ton of data to the browser .so performing the join across the whole dataset isn t needed but consider order if you can t get the recording in the correct order straight from index you re going to need to perform the entire join before order the results

1023486
authentication	login
it s used for authentication a passwd combined with a username and the ability to compare the generator hash with the one stored in a database to verify a login

1023516
groovy	scala	python	ruby
the jvm has had community project getting python and ruby running on the platform and even special languages such as scala groovy and closure developed for it

1023530
webserver	upload
also web sites generally are readonly unless you provide specific code on the webserver to support upload

1023534
children	nodes
a nodes and a few children deep

1023558
getdate	dateadd
you can also do this inside the database with getdate and dateadd ... or datediff ...

1023565
hide	show
control this form with show and hide methods from the outside code

1023586
virtualization	vmware
vmware is much more for usable virtualization rather than down-and-dirty

1023591
children	nodes
this checked if the list item has any children and if .so it filtering out only the text nodes and concatenation the result in this case it will work for text elements wherever they re put in the li

1023608
contains	any
file with that code minus any comments that it contains

1023618
google-chrome	firefox
i have just tested it with firefox and google-chrome for my application and page-refresh does not clear the history

1023646
virtualization	vmware
if it is a real hardware device of course vmware will not emulate it .so you won t be able to debugging the drivers under it nor will any other virtualization .software unless you extends one to do .so

1023646
device-driver	hardware
device-driver debugging can be done to some extent with a real hardware machine with a normals kernel - although there are obviously things you can t do - like set breakpoints

1023655
content-length	content-type
now you know the content-type and content-length maybe you need this for some kind of allocation

1023662
logout	login
.when the login methods execute the flag is modified accordingly similar with the logout methods

1023662
logout	login
a better way would be to keep a count in the db of how many logged in users total adding and subtract depending upon login or logout methods are execute

1023662
value	field
this methods is better because you won t have to run a selected query on your entire user table instead you can grab the value of one specific field from your db increasing performance

1023662
logout	login
unfortunately if they don t logout every time this methods is not useful unless you also store their login time and log them out after a certain amount of time

1023672
json	xml
ajax simply makes use of modern browser s javascript capabilities to send xml or often json to the server without reload the page

1023675
oracle	mysql
i am new to mysql but i have used oracle for some time

1023678
directory	folder
in sql management studio connect to your server right click on the databases folder and choose attach browse to your database and selected it note that you may need to move it to a directory sql can see - by default sql runs as network service and cannot peer inside c users

1023697
icollection	ienumerator
from my points of view though icollection implements ienumerator while sets don t have to be enumerator --- example set of real numbers between 1 and 2 even more sets can be generator dynamically

1023722
expression	brackets
in a nutshell i am trying to design a regular expression that will match an opening long brackets the string contents in between and the closing long brackets

1023728
exception-handling	try-catch
another nice feature of hashset is that it doesn t throw an exception-handling if you try and add a duplicates it just fails to add the duplicates entry which saves you having to put lots of try-catch blocks around every add - nice

1023744
any	set	arbitrary-precision	numeric
in fact a truly mathematical set may not be iterable or countable - for instances you could have the set of real numbers between 1 and 2. if you had an arbitrary-precision numeric types the count would be infinite and iterator over it wouldn t make any sense

1023768
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
i have used the sieve-of-eratosthenes but i have been searching around and have found that the sieve of atkin is a more efficient methods

1023772
handler	service
i can currently process this data using a standards asp.net page handler or in an asp web service but i want to know if its possible to process incoming binary-data in a wcf service

1023807
publishing	release
we are using nexus community edition see for caching external artifacts and publishing internal release and snapshots

1023808
quirks-mode	doctype
not having a doctype or having an invalid doctype throw ie into quirks-mode and it goes crazy

1023814
silverlight	wpf
can anyone explain how silverlight wpf databinding actually determines which is the right item to set as the selecteditem in a collections as in the following snippet

1023814
contains	set
in this example the items are strings and therefore value-type which are simple enough but what how does it know what to set as the selected item .when the collections contains something more complicated like object instances loaded at runtime

1023836
pyflakes	pylint
one tools like pyflakes and pylint and code introspection in your editor stops working

1023860
moving-average	continuous
i have a continuous value for which i d like to calculate an exponential moving-average

1023861
wait	hang
if you manually close firefox before the page is rendering it does not technically count as a crash simply a hang or that the user has not been patient enough to wait for the page to load of course there is a limit to anyone s patience

1023865
contains	elements
graphingelements contains the basic necessary methods for a graphing elements including how to draw a maximum width for zooming in whether a points is within that elements for touches and the standards touchesbegan touchmoved and touchended functions

1023878
export	csv
csv files will only export one sheet

1023927
continuous-integration	teamcity
maybe you can help things by putting them on a automated building and continuous-integration - cruisecontrol.net hudson or teamcity

1023933
listbox	textbox
supports a basic set of controls textbox dropdown listbox datepicker etc

1023967
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
on a ruby-on-rails project i m using sphinx together with thinking-sphinx plugins

1023997
value	field
if it doesn t think id is a primary key it will treat each row as a separate object and .so what if it has the same value in one of the field as another recording - that isn t exactly unusual

1024009
transparency	frame
could someone give an example of using freeimage to get into all the little details about a gif image such as frame background transparency etc.

1024011
dependency-injection	inject
i usually use dependency-injection to inject some kind of abstract ishowtheinterface thing and then invoke methods on the abstraction from within the cmd

1024016
background-image	transparency
i did think that a slightly transparency background-image might give the effect you wanted - but i ve just tried it and it didn t seem to work

1024021
perl	ruby
actionscript has always had garbage-collection like all scripting languages javascript perl ruby etc.. you just don t see it discussed much for as

1024025
verilog	vhdl
also you can checkout for vhdl and verilog modules

1024025
verilog	vhdl
you can selected different cores input parameters and get ready-to-use vhdl or verilog component

1024029
execution	restart
if the workflow starts as a result-of a user interactive operation or if it restart after waiting for a user activity which is web oriented then the workflow instances will be execution on the w3wp.exe process

1024030

right after i set it if i printing i get the right value but if i put it after that for by the end of the function .when i printing i get the first char of novoestado- rotulo.

1024062
python	c++
i m looking for a good setup for learning c++ and eventually python on mac osx

1024062
gtk	x11
i m thinking about going with eclipse and gtk x11

1024065
attributes	properties
anyway i don t think that xml-comments intellisense are supported on the markup and browsable attributes is only determine whether display the properties on the properties windows and editorbrowsable determine which windows will be use to edit the properties

1024069
typedef	struct
typedef struct nodes char rotulo 10 instrucao 1 2 10 flag

1024109
perl	c++	python	c++	python	perl
i guess it is a little off-topic since you specifically said c++ but i think perl or python would be much easier to use

1024118
python	c++
i have no experience using python but i know it s a much easier language to master than c++

1024118
python	c++
.so if you can master c++ python won t be any problem

1024130
configuration	environment
if environment variables are used it is usually as an alternative to the command-line arguments or to specify where the configuration is located

1024139
json	xml
used with json xml libs and the like

1024141
gtk	x11
apparently gtk has native osx widget support though i ve never used it .so you could skip the x11 stack altogether if you desired

1024149
expression	evaluation
actually the expression evaluation and rules engine feature of windows workflow-foundation can do things like this

1024162
pygtk	gtk
a development setup of gtk and pygtk can be a pita to set up on os x at least it was for me

1024165
python	c++
python is easy to learn and master especially if you are not tainted by c++

1024165
python	c++
c++ programmers often has to unlearn things as there are .so many things you must do and think of that you don t have to bother with in python

1024165
python	c++
with python you can concentrate on learning the libs and tools instead of having to learn how to not shoot yourself in the foot with c++

1024203
scala	java
with sun s recent decision not to include closures in jdk7 couldn t they put their weight behind scala as the java alternative for those wishing to have a more expressive language

1024205
python	c++
although both python and c++ support are rather new for it

1024207
intranet	lan
for an intranet server application the proxy details will be irrelevant as the clients will have internal lan access to your application making proxy settings irrelevant

1024216
tar	cat
many linux cmd such as cat cp ls more and tar are locate in bin

1024217
reflection	runtime
i am doing some byte code rewriting at runtime but only before the class is loaded and the first several call through reflection work fine

perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
perl python and ruby all grew up without support from the man well ruby had the japanese man but it wasn t a lot of help in the us

1024224
silverlight	wpf
i don t know if you re implementss a web - or windows .app but using a similar technique as the mozilla labs team did you could implements something similar in c# with technologies such as wpf or silverlight that also has canvas placeholder

reflection	runtime
generatormethodaccessor### are classes generator at runtime by the reflection implementation to call methods and constructor

1024263
value	field
the article you link to points this out as a solution to the seq scan problem if you add range constraints to the date field of each partition this query can be optimized into a loops where you query the â œlatestâ partition first and work backwards until you find a single value that is higher than the range of all the remaining partitions. --but doesn t show the improved plan you d see after that change

1024279
value	field
this may mean that the person object s ssn and terminationreason field may have to be taken out to be a key and value respectively

.solid model can be represented in a numbers of ways either by constructional .solid geometry csg where the shape is made up from the addition or subtraction of .solid primitive from each other or by boundary representation b-rep where the edges are stored or by triangulated faces as used by 3d studio max wpf and many others and .so on

1024338
file-format	dxf
these were multiplied several time over if we had to read the file-format ourselves - such as for dxf or vrml

1024342
.net	wcf
but this will work only if you re going to consume your wcf service by a .net client

1024366
implements	abstract
turning theory into practice the quake 3 source code does a pretty good job of dividing out different platform into separate areas for a c codebase available at however it does not demonstrate c++ patterns such as abstract interfaces implements once per platform

1024370
python	php
i have a python server finally working and responding to multiple cmd s with the output s however i m now having problem s with php receiving the full output

1024370

however it seems the python server is not sending a feof at the end of the output .so the php page timeout and does not display anything

1024396
calloc	malloc
or you could allocate it with calloc instead of malloc which will zero the memory that is returned to you

1024433
background-image	transparency
for instances you won t be able to tile a background-image with transparency

1024433
contains	elements
in the case of dximagetransform you may find that .when this is applied to elements that contains links those links are no longer clickable

1024455
python	perl
in the past i ve used perl s autoloader facility for implements lazy-loading of symbols into a namespace and wanted the same functionality in python

1024461
transparency	frame
to make the button transparency you can place a square inside it that is move to the hit-area frame of the button

1024469
folder	dir
i read about the symbolic links and junctions problems .so i use cmd dir al to find the real folder

1024471
any	set
this is simple to implements for combinations of 2 or 3 words set length for any numbers of elements but can this be done for arbitrary lengths

1024486

1024561
value	field
in most cases this object will not have been saved to the database yet .so if it uses the default autofield it might not yet have a value for its primary key field

1024577
contains	elements
finally the difference between first and take is that first returns the elements itself while take returns a sequences of elementss that contains exactly one elements

1024580
default-value	default
e.g like 0 for an int. the question here is not .when you want the default types but more are you willing to handle an exception-handling or handle a default-value

1024581
contains	elements
by the way if your sequences contains default t elementss null and you need to distinguish between being empty and the first elements being null you can t use firstordefault

1024591
directory	folder
i m trying to enable a php file to access another file residing in a folder outside the root web directory over an http connection

1024602
scala	ocaml
you may also want to look at some of the hybrid languages like scala or ocaml

1024602
scala	ocaml
scala is being used at twitter and ocaml is being used at jane s street in a financial trading platform

1024613
any	set
i guess that s the rea.son that asp.net insists on the primary key for the datakeynames - any other column or set of columns can t really be checked for validity - .so it s better to refuse them rather than running into the problems if it s not a uniquely identifying key...

1024619
python	java
many of them get to use c java etc at their workplace for the core project source but then also choose or need to use python for scripting such as build-scripting with scons other scripting that generator java etc code testing systemd proofs-of-concepts etc

1024704
directory	folder
i made sure that the folder adder building exists under the current directory

1024712
input-field	textarea
this works fine .when i m testing it on normals textarea s and input-field however .when i use the same code on the tinymce editor nothing happens

1024732
rendering	redraw
it brings me to question how do i enable redraw on the composite .so that the new labels or any other component i might create will rendering in-place of the old one

1024778
sigaction	signals
use sigaction with the sa_nodefer flag instead of signals to register the signals handler

1024802
realloc	malloc
just initializer instrucao to null and realloc will behave like malloc .when first passed a null-pointer

i would say that an open api is the ultimate sign of a server open to bots

1024804
bots	api
no api bots not welcome

1024813
factorization	primes
the computation of phi k has to be done using the primes factorization of k which is the only sensible way of doing it

1024813
factors	primes
if you now have to compute all primes divi.sors of every numbers between 1 and a large n you ll die of old age before seeing any result .so i d go the other way around building all numberss below n using their possible primes factors all primess less than or equals to n

1024813
factorization	primes
your problem is therefore going to be similar to computing all divisors of a numbers only you do not know what is the maximum numbers of time you may find a certain primes in the factorization beforehand

1024813
factors	primes
if you need help on computing all primes factors below n i ve also blogged about it .

1024826
javascript	dom	setinterval	settimeout	document.write	settimeout	document.write	setinterval
if you re attempting to sandbox javascript code and disable every possible way to evaluate strings into javascript code be aware that blocking all the obvious eval document.write new function settimeout setinterval innerhtml and other dom manipulations isn t enough

1024827
traversal	parent
it is possible to traversal a mutable order tree iteratively by recording the nodes s parent in the branches you take and knowing the directions you approach a nodes from down or up from the left or right which the order properties of the tree lets you test

1024827
children	nodes	children	tree
if rather than storing the children you store the xor of the parent and child then you can get the next nodes in whatever directions you approach from without having to mutate the tree

1024827
pointers	stack
usually recordinging the state on a stack takes less spaces that the call stack as you re selected only the essential local state to recording and are not recordinging return addresses or any caller-save registers if you used a functor rather than a function pointers then it s more likely that the compiler might be able to inline routine and .so not save the caller save registers in the simple recursive case .so reducing the amount of stack required for each recursion

1024834
administration	account
querying the permissions of this folder reveals that the everyone and administration grouping have no rights and the network service account has full control

1024839
factors	primes
the fastest way i found for calculating totient was to multiplying the primes factors p-1 together given that k has no repeated factors which was never the case if i remember the problem correctly

1024839
factorization	factors
.so for calculating factors it would probably be best to use gmpy.next_prime or pyecm elliptic-curve factorization

1024839
factors	primes
you could also sieve the primes factors as jaime suggests

1024839
factors	primes
for numbers up to 10 12 the maximum primes factors is below 1 million which should be reasonable

1024841
attributes	properties
sometimes they re cxmlnodes and these don t have attributes properties

shopping-cart	cart
or would it be more appropriate to be named according to the cart model where my shopping-cart will be stored

1024865
scala	java
since the java and .net ecosystems are seen as close rivals people aware of f# and the functional additions to c# may be inclined to look for jvm analogs and to me scala seems best equipped to fill that role

bots	api
poker academy has a bots api and they run an online service for botss

1024881
extends	final
to extends that technique for more than two bits between value in the final result you have to increase the shifts between where the bits end up

1024889
contains	set
i m assuming that variables contains 32-bit int with the highest 22 bits set to 0 which is a bit more restrictive than necessary

1024891
hash	md5
caveat make sure you find out the best way to make a key for your hash in just about every circumstance the md5 ... above is not a good decision speed and output length issues i used it for illustrative purposes

1024893
python	php
on the server-side you ll want to use language like php python or asp.net

1024908
webforms	asp.net
using asp.net webforms c# .net 2.0 etc

fireworks	photoshop
drawit is similar to adobe fireworks while pixels is like photoshop

1024983
formatting	import
i am import a feed into tumblr and because of the formatting of the site it show too many pictures

1024983
jquery	.post
no worries i made a jquery call that seemed to work fine on an individual .post

1024985
fireworks	photoshop
i don t know either of them but i have always worked with fireworks for things as web design as seemingly opposed to a lot of people who prefer photoshop

1025008
dictionary	map
i suggest to use a dictionary to map between the input and the cmd

1025024
ip-address	hostname
value must be an ip-address and not a hostname

1025031
ia-32	x86
these do not use the ia-32 isa commonly known as x86

1025031
ia-32	x86
it does happen to be able to run x86 code in little-endian mode but the native isa is not ia-32

1025031
powerpc	arm
ubuntu is available for x86 little-endian and x86_64 little-endian with less complete ports for ia64 big-endian arm el little-endian pa-risc big-endian though the processor supports both powerpc big-endian and sparc big-endian

1025036
cucumber	webrat
i ve just gotten started using bdd with rspecifications cucumber webrat and ruby-on-rails and i ve run into some frustration trying to get my view specifications to pass

1025036

1025048
margins	padding
what i did is simply play with margins and padding value using firebug

1025048
margins	padding
change the margins the padding the size

1025059
any	set
you can also set the uses attributes to false if you do not wish to associate any model with your controllers

1025072
arrays	loops
now i changed my rendering loops .so i just read straight from the vector arrays

1025074
hide	show
it doesn t matter if i just hide and show divs on the same page or if i go to a new html page

1025074
hide	show
home and service are the two links and i would like service .when click to hide the #slideshow div and show the slideshow2 div which would be hidden and then replace the first one

1025080
http	ssl
another potential difference is that google and yahoo use http and if your php or ssl installation is misconfigured perhaps missing ca certs then your openid code will fail to establish an associations or complete the check_authentication call

1025087
put	get
for that to work properly you ll need to fiddle around with the loader and applicationdomain .so that the classes get put into the proper domain

1025089
callback	methods	hide	show
you should use the callback methods of the show hide methodss

1025089
callback	methods
the callback methods is the second parameter of the .show hide functions

1025089
callback	methods
therefore you can close open your box and within the callback methods run an event immediately afterwards

1025105
subclassing	inherited
you never know .when you ll want to have a subclassing that acts like the others but really needs to inherited another class for some reason

1025105
abstract-base-class	virtual-method
your testing reveals you can t take the performance hit of virtual-method call use an interface as well as an abstract-base-class where it makes sense

1025108
spaces	output
fundamentally flartoolkit is analyzing the camera s output and figuring out where in 3d spaces the marker exists and how it is oriented

the semantics of sed -i vary from linux to bsd

1025185
javascript	dom
i have a web form that contains lots of javascript functionalities to manipulate the dom

1025213
postback	ajax
if you use ajax to postback to the form asynchronously you can use the updateprogress control

1025216
value	field
in my templates i m having that field omitted electing instead to prepare the value for that field in the view then pass those prepare value into request.post actually a copy of request.post because request.post is immutable then feeding request.post to the form and then carry on as normals

perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
if you don t know a scripting-language like perl python or ruby this is a good time to start learning one

1025255
versioning	upgrade
the problem is inorder to get fixed you pretty much have to upgrade to the next versioning of scala as upgrade come out

1025255
versioning	upgrade
the problem with that is that most versioning upgrade contains breaking changes thus inorder to obtain fixed you are likely to have to change your own code

1025255
versioning	upgrade
inorder for scala to be viable in such situations long-term .someone will have to start back porting fixed to earlier versioning .so that people don t have to perform breaking upgrade just to get .some fixed

1025276
gettext	poedit

it makes a nice see through form that lets mouse click pass-through it

1025303
digits	zero
note that the 02d gives you a guarenteed two digits zero filled numbers which is usually what you want for numberss in parts of time

1025329
32-bit	64bit
arraylist are even more spaces inefficient .when used on 64bit to store primitive elements because of the 64bit wide memory references as opposed to 32-bit references on 32-bit machines and boxing

1025337
constructor	object
let s assume the object of types c is created in the definition of a s constructor in the .cpp file which also contains the definition of struct c

1025380
factors	primes
no one has found a faster way to calculate phi k aka euler s totient function than by first finding the primes factors of k

1025380
private-key	rsa
both the public and the private-key in rsa are calculated based on phi n where n is the product of two large primes.

1025409
moss	wss
i now want to do either a fulltextsqlquery or a keywordquery against either the moss or wss query engine and get security trimmed results based on an impersonated user

1025409
constructor	object
both object can take a spsite on the constructor but ignore my impersonation logic

1025423
arrays	loops
a good idea might be to use two loops to account for the case where the arrays don t have equals member count like this

1025430
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
or am i still supposed to be thinking of creating a data-access-layer and a business-logic-layer in my project

1025435
append	input
then if you wanted to append the input to an elements on the page with id foo

1025449
macros	vba
also you state macros but are you talking about vba code or ms-access macros

1025449
macros	vba
for example words macros are vba code

1025449
macros	vba
however ms-access is different in this regards and ms-access has both macros and vba code

1025459
embedded-resource	resx
i am guessing as images and icons are stored in a resx file i am guessing that it should be relatively easy to store a byte arrays or similar streaming in an embedded-resource file

1025482
selected	checkbox
ensure that the set as main project checkbox is selected and clear the create main class field

1025498
dictionary	arrays
however the return arrays object at index is not according to the dictionary for instances the first object in dictionary was title but in my arrays it returned contact numbers why this happended and how to prevent

1025499
contains	elements
the hierarchy rules are easy to express in xml schema by stating which elements may contains which child elementss

1025499
children	nodes
nodes that just serve to structure long lists of children for easier use

1025499
xsd	xml
i can think of alternatives like having specific folder elements for each possible rules ugly simply ignoring the ruless in xsd and enforcing them in code fine with me or somehow separating object hierarchy and intermediate nodes in the xml not quite sure how

edit original question was edited to specify more significant digits required no extra leading spaces beyond what s requiredd for the largest numbers and provide a new example where my previous suggestion above doesn t match the desired output

1025539
perl	tcl	perl	awk
and then you have examples like awk tcl tk perl which says that initially was a combinations between sh and awk but it became .so powerful that he considers it an odd but full-fledged programming language

1025550
selected	textbox
you can use simple jquery-selectedors to selected server side controls suppose you have following textbox on your page

1025550
jquery	.post
if you want to .post form via jquery ajax then use this code

1025551
64bit	x86
another strange problem is that sqlce 3.5 sp1 with entity-framework will not work on 64bit systemd unless you building it to target x86

1025565
directory	folder
hiding usage information in registry or some folder in c basically outside virtual directory is not an option for a website

1025572
contains	elements
it would be possible to introduce single-level folder though or more generally n-level folder but not arbitrarily-recursive ones since those would have to be global elements which then wouldn t know what they are contains in

1025574
interface-builder	iboutlet
from what i understand uiimageviews have user integration disabled by default .so i have enabled it both via interface-builder and in my uiviewcontroller s viewdidload methods i have tied the uiimageview to an iboutlet

1025627
base-class	inherited
where you try to assign a base-class to an inherited class which is impossible

1025627
base-class	inherited
let s say t base-class is of types streaming and u is of types memorystreaming inherited class you cannot assign a streaming to a variables of types memorystreaming

1025632
configuration	environment
he has some code in the environment configuration file production would look like this rails_root configuration environment production.rb

1025647
entity-framework	ado.net
i am very confused with the use subsonic or ado.net entity-framework which one i should pefer

1025653
pointers	stack
p ends up in the same place on stack as the former nptr .so it might still contains a seemingly valid pointers

1025666
put	get
you create an activity indicator and put it onscreen where you like - then you tell it to startanimating .when you request the media and stopanimating .when you get a callback that the playback has begun

1025670
contains	any	display	width
my goal is to display a grid that neatly fills all available width with cell - no unused dark grey areas down the right and sizes each column appropriately according to the data it contains but also allows the user to resize any of the columns to their liking

1025670
contains	set
i ve tried not setting the autosizemode of all the columns which does allow resizing but doesn t set the initial size according to the data the cell contains

1025714
realloc	malloc
wrap malloc and realloc like this

1025745
arrays	loops
if you are worried about the order and you re running on ios 4 or earlier loops over a copy of the arrays

1025749
click	mouse
i want to handle all left mouse button click from mycontrol instances

1025751
dictionary	arrays
it s just accessing the key and value of the arrays all php arrayss are really dictionary hash maps simultaneously

1025755
floating	margins
in that case don t bother floating the content div and just set a right margins on it to prevent it from going under the menu

1025773
positioning	slider	margins	padding
this might mean that the slider is trying to positioning the li elements but some padding margins or border outside of the li is making the offset calculations wrong

1025802
dictionary	map
alternatively if there is truly a one-to-one relationship between the key perhaps you could use a dictionary to map from old key to new key and enumerate over the result-of

1025819
getter	setter
a properties is actually some syntactic-sugar and is implements by 2 methodss a getter methods and a setter methods

1025819
getter	setter
.so i think that you should be able to determine if a properties is abstract by checked if the getter and or setter are abstract like this

1025820
udp	tcp
then you should be able to send and receive data using tcp oder udp like you would do with any other normals application

1025820
udp	tcp
you just need to think in terms of how can i exchange messages using tcp or udp between my device and my server now

1025837
linked-list	arrays
.so i have this general purpose hashtable class i m developing and i want to use it genericsally for any numbers of incoming typess and i want to al.so initializer the internal storage arrays to be an arrays of linked-list s for collision purposes where each linked-list is specified ahead of time for types-safety to be of the types of the generics from the hashtable class

1025840
attributes	properties
if it is just purely the properties of the nodes then perhaps using attributes may be the most elegant solution but if they have different behavior then it would points me towards separate classes

1025844
data-structures	linked-list
they also suggested things like changing data-structures like a java linked-list to an arraylist changing algorithms using merge sort instead of bubble-sort and even rewriting large chunks of code as refactoring

1025847
subclassing	superclass
that is have a conversion methods in superclass bar and implements it in subclassing eg mybar httpbar etc

1025858
json	xml
as a portable data format across computers i d consider something of higher abstraction level such as json or even xml that does not tie the data format to a particular implementation

1025862
32-bit	64bit
additionally if you do things like provide length prefixes or file offset you may have a mixture of 32-bit and 64bit pointers

1025871
apache-config	httpd.conf
and i try to add the following settings in my apache-config file usr local apache_modperl conf httpd.conf

1025881
dictionary	arrays
by decoupling the indexed order from the insert order doesn t this simply boil down to keeping an arrays and dictionary in a single object

1025905
google-chrome	firefox
this gives me problem in ie if the containers div is not big enough to show it tried with firefox google-chrome it is working fine

1025921
silverlight	wpf	expression-blend	silverlight	expression-blend	wpf
from your question it s not clear if you are creating a silverlight or a wpf application in expression-blend

1025959
background-color	transparency
a png file can contains a background-color which can be used .when transparency doesn t work

1025959
background-color	transparency
create a transparency png and save it with an orange or pink background-color

1025959
background-color	display	background-color	transparency
ie6 does not support transparency pngs .so it will display them with whatever background-color you saved them with

1025959
background-color	transparency
.when saving transparency pngs save them with the same background-color as your website

1025964
dlopen	dlsym
now i am thinking of using dlsym and dlopen to use these libs instead of linking them explicit

1025977
debugging	trace
next to integration with c i find myself only using void-pointerss .when i need to debugging trace some code and like to know the address of a certain pointers

1025978
constructor	object
the arrays should be allocated in the object constructor not passed as a parameter

1025981
nhibernate	ado.net
asp.net-mvc can be used whether you use an orm like nhibernate or you use plain ado.net + dal factory or whatever -- what you ll not going to be able to use are those asp.net objectdatasources that you drag and drop with your user-interface

1026006
subtract	add
we have 2 variants of solution the first is to use len replace and the second is add a single symbols and then subtract 1 from result

1026015
windows-xp	windows
and how you can achieve that is describe under using windows-xp visual styles with controls on windows forms

1026018
command-line	cmd
i am also a command-line fan and i often issue cmd like svn status and svn updates from the command-line but as some have suggested here .when it comes to commit time i really need more information about what i am going to commit than what the command-line offers

1026020
png	gif
you must edit the image in a paint program like gimp add a transparency layer remove the part you don t like with the eraser and save it as gif or png

1026030
registration	login
by registration i mean the files to register a new account login checked the email sending a mail and edit the user information

1026061
contains	any
in the actual instances i am working with the car class is not in the same namespace as the resolvemake class and it contains no references to any instancess of it

1026067
checkbox	textbox
you can get what you want with triggers but not using styles you can use a datatemplate like this the textbox and checkbox are there for testing

1026116
jquery	.post
can you .post your reasons why you use jquery user-interface and why you don t use it

1026138
lookup	any
is there any rules how the jndi lookup named in jboss are decided if we don t provide any

1026142
csv	xml
don t use csv xml - use 1 000 parameters instead

1026153
antivirus	mcafee
.when i started searching about this error in google i came to know that may be because of mcafee antivirus this error may come

1026161
jndi	jmx
i m not sure about jboss 5 but under jboss 4 the jmx console has an mbean called jndiview which has operations to dump the entire jndi tree to the console

1026166
linux	unix
new features open server 15.0 and sdk 15.0 for windows linux unix and mac os x

1026178
entity-framework	ado.net
i am using the ado.net entity-framework datamodel

1026178
entity-framework	ado.net
i send data from sql to a gridview via ado.net entity-framework

1026184
value	field
field in the attributes table contains possible answers as labels value pairs

1026184
value	field
it is easier for maintenance and usage in php unserialize the field to use it change it single updates to modify but you won t be able to is this value properly in a sql query

1026192
decrement	increment
.when you add a datetimepicker control you can selected part of the control value for example the month and then use the up down arrows to modify this part of the date time value for example increment decrement the month

1026221
scriptaculous	jquery
i tried differend javascript frameworks jquery scriptaculous standalone - .so i guess it s my image-gallery which causes this behaviour.

1026239
versioning	upgrade
i compared the upgrade project files in vs2k10 and the only difference was the updates versioning numbers - how can i stop vs from doing this

1026247
exception-handling	try-catch
i ve got input that may or may not be xml and i want code that recognises that input may not be xml without relying on a try-catch for both speed and on the general principles that non-exceptional circumstances shouldn t raise exception-handling

1026290
jmstemplate	jms
it may be possible to convince jmstemplate not use the current transactional context although it makes a points of trying to hide the unpleasantness of the jms api from you

1026313
base-class	superclass
you can maybe use the fact that .when you make a cast from a pointsers to a base-class that is not the only base-class the compiler will adjust the pointsers .so that it will points to the beginning of the superclass

1026315
deployment	install
the problem is i do not know the deployment url of the clickonce client at building time .so the setup.exe cannot run properly .when the install from a website option is checked

1026315
deployment	install
for now the workaround is to have an offline install which contains the setup.exe prerequisites and the clickonce deployment files in a big zipfile

1026315
configuration	installation
is there a simple way to modify the installation url of the clickonce application .when deploying the server in a network like writing the url in a configuration file or something

1026316
arrays	loops
-referencing the arrays in a local variables within the function of the for-each loops is irrelevant but in the for-loops you do get a speed bump 75ms instead of 105ms

1026317
contact	submit
what i would like to use is some kind of form where the user gets to search for a contact any combo of first last named and an event any combo of named date selected each from two respective lists where all other information is display as well to distinguish the results add some extra information and hit submit

1026321
nstextview	nsbox	nstextview	nsmenu	nsmenu	nsbox
the controllers has an nsmenu outlet rcmenu and also an nstextview outlet itemview for the nsbox subclassing that should be where the menu pop-up

1026324
click	mouse
i have code written on my listbox mouse double click

1026324
click	mouse
on mouse double click i want a mouse double click event to be fired first and then the button click

1026336
magento	cart
how i change the positioning of module of magento cart top button...left right

1026338
c-preprocessor	macros
you probably don t need a helpers libs written in c however you may need it during development to extraction actual value hidden behind different c-preprocessor macros

1026339
arrays	loops
then on the server side you can easy loops over the _files uploadfiles arrays

1026370
multiplying	addition
as you can see it s simply multiplying with an addition and a shift

1026373
entity-framework	nhibernate
also checkout the ncommon which has repository paterns etc for nhibernate linq2sql and entity-framework among other goodies

1026382
instances	destroy
however looking at the code you posted i can see that there is likely to be a problem you declare an instances of mycug on stack then attach it but that stack-based instances will be destroy as soon as the oninitdialog methods exists

1026393
google-chrome	firefox
however for some reasons the flash works fine in ie but not in firefox or google-chrome

1026405
jquery	.post
jquery s .post methods is fine for what you re doing talking to a scripting that affects the database deletes updates etc using one of the get ajax methodss .load or .get break the http specifications

1026412
jndi	jmx
i checked the jndi view with jmx console the bean is registered only internally not in the global jndi

1026454
python	ruby
if may work only if it is script-based like in ruby python etc.

1026467
selected	button
if nothing is selected in the list box disable the ok button command.canexecute would return false

1026467
selected	button
if something is selected in the list box enable the ok button

1026483
macros	vba
i ve been asked to updates some excel 2003 macros but the vba project are passwd protected and it seems there s a lack of documentation.

1026496
associations	model
the way i see it the general rules for a specific diagram span the model perspectives again it is absurd for a class to extends an associations but the different model perspectives will superimpose certain meaning to a particular types of diagram

1026496
associations	model
for instances an associations in the class-diagram of the domain model conceptual perspective will inherently be bidirectional whereas it can be either bi- or unidirectional in the class-diagram of the design model specifications implementation perspective

1026507
digits	zero
time that are less than 4 digits long need to be prefixed with a zero 0 to make them the same length as the ones with 4 digits

1026547
macros	let
load excel in your favourite debugger ollydbg being my tool of choice find the code that does the comparison and fix it to always return true this should let you access the macros

1026563
perl	php	python	php	python	perl	vbscript	perl
python php perl javascript vbscript

1026619
.when	ready
.when a marketing guy at sun declare that tcl was enterprise ready the developers added the following feature

1026620
stderr	stdout
the redirects stderr to stdout and using passthru instead of execute will give you all the output

1026624
scriptmanager	updatepanel
other than updatepanel scriptmanager timer

1026627
where-clause	sql
that said it s usually better to do this kind of filtering in your sql query with a where-clause

1026650
selected	cell
if you copy the cell with the function in it then click the column header to selected all of it that you want the function to persistent in then right click - paste special - formuals that should do the trick

1026664
aggregate	grouping
creates a concatenation string of its arguments per detail and aggregate by concatenation those per grouping

1026664
aggregate	grouping
if you realize that than you realize that it does not make sense to aggregate it there is just one value right nor to grouping by it as it won t make the result more unique as you re already groupinging by on the pk

1026666
internet-explorer	firefox
the code bellow works on internet-explorer but .when used on firefox it is like it wont wait for the call to return a value despite the async fale

1026676
internet-explorer	firefox
also see different results selected html elements with xpath in firefox and internet-explorer for a previous related discussion

1026682
directory	folder
let s say i have a file directory that stores all the images and other file types and this file directory is located on a different drive then my application folder

1026699
ubuntu	debian
i ve created a ubuntu debian package that install an application that depends on r

1026704
required	checked
a bit of advice you may wish to make the arguments.distinct not required and do a simple checked with if structkeyexists arguments distinct do something

1026731
selected	listbox
i want to selected all the items in listbox

1026731
radio-button	selected	selected	listbox
now i want to do validation like if i selected all items by using listbox1.selectedall and then if i selected one item in listbox all selecteded items selectedion is going off and the radio-button still showing the selectedall is checked.but i dont have all items selecteded in a listbox

1026745
contains	set
map.keyet will return a set contains all of the map s key

1026751
look-and-feel	nimbus
i suggest to look at either synth or nimbus look-and-feel to make it easier

1026764
punctuation	words
there are also potential issues with punctuation or other characters which are neither words nor whitespace characters

1026767
number-formatting	formatting
for instances formatting on the organization named is probably very significant whereas telephone number-formatting is not

1026769
pointers	stack
i m having trouble understanding the following bit of code that i was hoping would create an arrays on the heap and fill it with the characters 9 down to 0 i know i could just index the arrays like a normals stack arrays with notation to do this but i m doing it this way to try to understand pointers in more depth

1026775
any	set
another way is to set transparencykey to a color like magenta or any other not used on the form

1026775
background-image	transparency
then set a background-image properties to some image on which magenta color will represent transparency areas

1026779
for-loop	arrays
in your first for-loop increment the pointsers such that it doesn t points to the beginning of the arrays anymore

1026782
arrays	loops
after the first loops in the first snippet the pointsers will points to the end of the arrays rather than the beginning

1026788
pointers	stack
i think you just need to watch your heap and stack usage you can grab pointers to local-variables to get an idea of where stack is at the moment and if it s too high reduce it

1026795
attributes	properties
you need to set the spquery.expandrecurrances and spquery.calendardate properties prior to running the caml query and you can only do this using the object-model not the web-services or by setting an attributes in caml

1026799
arrays	loops
as you iterate through your loops you are increment the pointers and by the end of the for-loops you are points to the last elements in the arrays

1026799
for-loop	arrays
.when you go through the for-loop to display all of your value you are indexing to value past the end of the arrays since ptrheaparrays is points to the last elements in the arrays you allocated

1026808
arrays	loops
in the first loops you increment your pointers ptrheaparrays until the end of arrays

1026808
for-loop	arrays
.so after execution the first for-loop your pointers is points to end of the arrays and not at the beggining

1026810
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
an argumentnullexception would be misleading .so argumentexception is a better fit

1026827
arguments	default
what is the default datatype of arguments taken in the case show above

1026833
pointers	stack
the return-value is a void pointers and could be compared with the address of an arbitrary stack allocated variables

1026835
png	gif
suppose i have image canvas or previously loaded image which supports transparency gif png

1026839
put	get
.so for example it is x 50 and you can put that into the line above to get the y

1026859
radio-button	checkbox	radio-button	button	checkbox	button
i would suggest using a single checkbox or two standards button s instead of radio-button s

1026859
radio-button	selected
if some but not all or none of the items are selected which radio-button will you checked

1026859
radio-button	selected
it doesn t make sense to have a some selected radio-button

1026859
selected	button
with button you simply selected unselected all of the items .when the button is pressed

1026859
selected	checkbox
with a single checkbox you can use the three state feature to set the checkbox as follows checked all selected

1026859
checkbox	listbox	updating	updates
handle the appropriate checked and unchecked handler on the checkbox for updating the listbox and respond to the listbox.selectionchanged event to updates the checkbox in response to manual selection changes

1026863
linux	unix
have a look at jar.exe or jar if in linux unix

1026867
webserver	security
but that probably won t work for webserver because of the security policy web apps are not allowed to peek at each other

1026872
web-applications	security
the expected behavior of the weblogic security model is that you would not have access to the other web-applications classloader

1026889
google-chrome	firefox
here s a really really simple one works in firefox google-chrome and ie7

1026894
javascript	dom
basically javascript has native support for the html dom but not for the xml dom

1026896
realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free
b more commonly you have a 16 k heap you ve been doing a bunch of malloc free realloc call and your heap is less than 50 full you call malloc for 1k and it fails - what s up

1026896
malloc	free
you d need to add logging shim to malloc and free .so that you can get an idea of what dynamic memory operations are being performed

1026903
contains	any
is it common advisable to wrap response within a class which contains any error information

1026905
children	tree
to walk through you current .application s .applications resolution tree but you really can t look through the children .app s classloader

1026915
styledtext	swt
you can find many great code-snippets at the swt snippets page including examples for drag and drop using the styledtext widget

1026925
python	php
which algorithm is the easiest to implements php python

1026946
shutdown	restart
a software company could use it as a remote shell like interface and issue cmd to shutdown restart and to publishing patches

1026952
base-class	inherited
in other words if you have a grouping of object that all inherited from the same base-class or all implements the same interface that would be an instances where you would want to use the factory-pattern that would be the pattern you would look for

1026977
shutdown	restart
one of it is already available for windows - tweetmypc v2.0 lets you shutdown restart logoff and lots more in your windows pc.remotely.

1026980
hide	show
instead you should use show and hide with control logic inside your main form

1026997
abstract-factory	factory-method
are you talking about factory-method or abstract-factory

1027009
bufferedwriter	bufferedreader
i try to use bufferedreader bufferedwriter but than the i must refresh the file

1027017
contains	any
edit sorry i meant to write n instead of 100 this needs to work for a contains area of any percentage or size

1027040
keydown	keyup
this should definitely work in general case but some corner cases might have unexpected results like having keyup keydown events overrides

1027050
value	field
it sets a recordset2 types object equals to the value of the attachment field

1027054
nunit	moq
i am using nunit and moq for my frameworks

1027067
contains	any
our job will not run if a scheduling rules is held by another thread for the workspace root itself or for any of the resources contains in the workspace

1027081
versioning	upgrade
if you make sure you ve upgrade to the latest versioning of this plugins you can create multiple forms each with their own response messages

1027082
constructor	object
overloading constructor is a common practice to make it easier for the developer to create new object .when they just want to use the default properties settings

1027082
constructor	object
the parameterless constructor often called the default-constructor simply creates a new object using the default formsauth and provider object which are specified via constructor-chaining

1027085
alloca	free
you can use alloca function that allocates memory on stack - this memory will be free automatically .when you exit the function

1027091
contains	set
i ve set the other_cflags to contains

1027093
webserver	nginx
how about running a simple webserver like apache nginx and have a php or cgi or other scripting that simply returns the time in any format you want

1027099
authentication	login
however the basic setup i use which uses the channelset login approach form the flex side looses the authentication information sessions on each page-refresh

1027108
innodb	myisam
updates i created a new table myisam of the same schema copy-paste over all the recording insert-into selected the changed the engine on the new table innodb rename the corrupt table and rename the new table then tried again and got the same error

1027134
directory	folder
try creating a virtual directory of the folder that holds the images and use that as away of linking to the folder

1027140
itemscontrol	tabcontrol
here s a link to the silverlight forums where somebody built a tabcontrol using the itemscontrol with sample xaml code

1027145
contains	elements
my selection contains elements of types uielement .so i don t know and really shouldn t care what shape is selected inorder to make my selection mode as generics as i can and i d like to draw bounding-box while user move selected shape

1027147
selected	button
i know you can use the right-click button on the keyboard go to resolve menu item and selected using system.data.sql .

1027149
dialog	pop-up
i need a pop-up dialog to be show .when i get a messages from different thread but the dialog should be not dependent on activity i.e it should display the dialog wherever the screens focus is

1027151
contains	any
i started by redirecting request to .some special subdirectories but now it should work directly without any further subdirectories .so i .somehow have to separate regular request for exuisting pages to request that don t contains .php or .html .

1027153
python	php	python	java
for java php python etc

1027165
difference	factors
option 2 will be slower than option 1 yes but even though the difference might be a factors of 10 even that high factors .when the slow versioning is sufficiently fastwill not be noticed by a human the numbers used are just given as examples

1027171
emacs	vim	notepad++	emacs	notepad++	vim
have a look at notepad++ vim gnu emacs or similar

1027185
ip-address	hostname
replacing the ip-address and hostname with the ones you care about

1027193
hosts-file	hosts
not answering the question directly but to test virtual hosts before the dns entry has propagated in the past i ve added an entry to my local hosts-file

1027194
selected	button
selected the keyboard button from the bottom of the dialog

1027215
value	field
the value of this parameter field will correspond to a recording in the lookup table using the code field as the key

1027222
aggregate	grouping
i haven t checked it through thoroughly but it looks like your problem is you have completed which is your aggregate in your grouping by at the end

1027236
parsing	comma
i need a regex that will parsing a csv-style file something like 57 field wide most field enclosed in quotes but maybe not all separated by comma with quoted field having the possibility of embedded double that represent single-quotes in the evaluated string

1027236
parsing	comma
i m a regex beginner intermediate and i think i can get pretty quickly to the basic expression to do the field parsing but it s the embedded double-quotes and comma i can t get my head around

1027283
versioning	upgrade
.when vs detection that the project file is not high enough for it s versioning it will force an upgrade

1027301
updating	updates
edit for information updating to eclipse 3.5 galileo didn t .solve the issue .so i m guessing it s not linked to only the previous updates

1027312
initializer	getter
or initializer _myperson to null then in the myperson getter have a

1027329
web-services	webserver
also another reason why i say 500 would be appropriate is that from my experience in .net web-services whenever i throw an exception-handling across the wire such as a recordnotfound exception-handling the webserver and client have always interpreter the response to be a 500 status code

1027350
silverlight	wpf
i would prefer to do it in silverlight but wpf and win forms is also fine

1027351
associations	model
is this an instances in which i would want to use the has_and_belongs_to_many associations types on the link model

1027360
selected	textbox
there is a textbox on the form which should display the total amount of the selected gridview rows

1027360
subtract	add
hence i need to capture events .when the user selected deselected the gridview rows and calculate add subtract the amount accordingly

1027367
margins	padding
you might also want to add padding 0 and margins 0 to that if you want to remove indentation as well

1027398
versioning	upgrade
.when you upgrade to the next versioning of the 3rd party source tell svn to merge the difference between software-versioning and next-versioning into a working copy of trunk software

1027414
dictionary	arrays
it s worth points out that jsonvalue can also return a dictionary or an arrays

1027430
key-value	key
if i only need the key because it expresses the intention much better than iterator over the key-value pairs and it is not slow - accessing a key is o 1

1027447
contains	set
the returned document should contains an error-code that is part of a documented set of codes specific to your web service as well as a short description of the problem and optional a more detailed description of the problem

1027472
put	get
rest uses different http methods get .post put delete to specify which action is wanted and the server returns the status as the http-status

1027491
json	xml
in asp.net-mvc it will end at specified controllers action methods which will decide what to do further - it can return specified view wherever it s physical location is it can return plain text it can return something serialization in json xml

1027495
double-quotes	spaces
this versioning handles quoted strings quotes escaped as double-quotes and trims extra escaped quotes and spaces around the whole string original test double-quoted test

1027516
getter	setter
has anyone an implementation that implements propertiesdescriptor for a dsl where the getter and setter use the exact same named as the properties and a way to hook that into the java rt .so i don t need to create them all by myself

1027519
data-structures	linked-list
that being said several time in the past i wrote a linked-list implementation from scratch myself .when creating infrastructure code for complex data-structures

1027557
base-class	inherited
in one scripting i ve written i even went as far as writing a base-class to declare an interface with a set of methodss and then deriving concrete classes to inherited that interface but i think i get it now - that s just wrong in python and whether an object has a particular methods is checked at runtime at the points where the call is made

1027557
python	c++
i realise python is .so much more dynamic than c++ it s taken me a while to see how little code you actually need to write

1027564
javascript-engine	spidermonkey
i would like to use spidermonkey the javascript-engine from mozilla in my application

1027568
inno-setup	nsis
inno-setup and nsis are free tools for creating application setups

1027589
python	c++
in most languages that i know c++ python objective-c there are frameworks that implements those data-structures .so that you don t have to reinvent the wheel

1027613
selected	button
i assume you start it and then either hit a button or selected a menu item to start some process

1027622
selected	cell
now i selected this result range and change its format of the cell to numbers format to numbers with 0 decimal places..

1027629
webforms	asp.net
let s say you have a structure like this in webforms asp.net

1027629
json	xml
each one of these actions will then decide what view be this html or json xml needs to be returned to the browser

1027632
constructor	object
you could use a second constructor that takes the fonts object as parameter and sets it before initializecomponent is called

1027634
json	xml
is there a way to convert the json xs boolean value in a data structure to xml

1027640
perl	php	directory	folder
this would not be ideal but in the absence of server-side process which you really should be doing--either php or ruby-on-rails or perl or whatever your hosts supports you could allow directory listing on your images folder

1027654
json	xml
in this case then you d return 200 as normals with the payload of your request xml or json or whatever indicating that no matching entity was found

1027662
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it seems as though being responsible for a single page s actions goes against one of the things asp.net-mvc was trying to improve on from webforms

1027665
rar	zip
the best way is to take your db offline zip it up or rar whatever and copy the .zip file somewhere safe

1027669
implements	extends
one way is to implements an activator for pluginss a which extends at least the class plugins pluginsa

1027683
perl	php
create the javascript file via some dynamic back-end php or perl scripting are best for that

1027683
perl	php
the main javascript function could still be static but the initialization of the arrays used by it either as a snippet on the main html page or a separate .js import file would be a php perl generator url

1027683
perl	php	json	xml
make an xmlhttprequest ajax call from your javascripting to a separate service basically a url backed by - again - php perl backend scripting returning xml json your_data_format_of_choice list of files

1027683
png	gif
an un-orthodox solution - if browsers you care about support animated background images gif png just compile your set of images especially if they are small sized into an animated-gif png and use that as background

1027705
push	pull
should i use ajax push or pull

1027719
required	checked
the only thing i d checked is whether the database load required for this will be an issue

1027753
session-cookies	cookies
you can ensure that the session-cookies will be specific to the application by making sure that the domain and path of the cookies are set restrictively for an application at you could do the following

1027756
derived-class	base-class
in the derived-class a methods is virtual if it is defined virtual in the base-class even if the keyword virtual is not used in the derived-class s methods

1027775
value	field
i have to deal with a table where there is a set of field each followed by a second field that will hold a suggested new value until this change is confirmed

1027775
coalesce	isnull
i was playing around a little with some union selected with coalesce and isnull .

1027785
silverlight	wpf
the hardest part is going to be rewriting the interface in either wpf silverlight or xna or both there are pros and cons to each one but i m leaning towards wpf right now because of the fonts support and because that way i won t have to write all the widget

1027791
checkbox	textbox	value	field
sometimes it is easier for the user if he is able to enter the actual field value in a textbox such as 0x03 if the first two checkbox are checked

1027791
checkbox	textbox
due to layout constraints i would prefer not to have both the checkbox and textbox visible at the same time

1027791
radio-button	selected
i want to provide a radio-button that allows him to selected which view he wants to use for editing the value

1027804
directory	folder
.when building a project in xcode 3.1.2 2 folder are automatically added as header directory with the -i option

1027808
multiplication	division
t is not very important as long as alpha is small otherwise you will run into some rather weird nyquist issues alias etc. and if you are working on a processor where multiplication is cheaper than division or fixed-point issues are important precalculate omega

1027840
put	get
can you put some code in the executetest to get a templates from that subfolder

1027850
pylons	django	web-frameworks	pylons
it gives instructions on using virtualenv building a custom python c if you absolutely need that and running wsgi apps -- wsgi is the common underpinning of all modern python web-frameworks including django which everybody s recommending but also pylons c

1027850
pylons	django
i m trying to play devil s advocate since everybody else s recommending django but for a beginner django may in fact be better than pylons still spending a day or .so lightly researching each main alternative before you commit to one is a good investment of your time

1027858
spring	grails
if you re familiar with spring-mvc and java you might want to look at grails which is built on top of spring amongst other things

1027867
linux	unix
no you can t access com object from linux unix

1027870
windows-server	windows
if the com object is running on a windows-server and providing a soap interface then you should be fine - just connect to the windows machine over http and make the soap request

1027881
httpd.conf	.htaccess
httpd.conf and or .htaccess and

1027881
javascript	dom
since this output is pretty predictable you might try parsing out the filenames using a javascript regular expression but it s probably just as easy and more robust to create a hidden div on your page put the html response into that div and then use dom methods to find s that are after tags with an attributes

1027890
easymock	jmock
both jmock and easymock will support all the assert you might want to make on the messages you are sending and you testing is complete

1027900
contains	any
an interface is even more abstract than an abstract-class in that it cannot contains any executable code

1027904
reflection	runtime
java reflection provides a mechanism to introspect an object at runtime

1027918
gnome	kde
your process might have been started without a visible terminal as is common in graphical user environment like kde gnome or windows

1027941
keyword	term
module is a more generics term but some languages have it as a keyword modula 2

1027960
contains	any
a module to me would rather be a deployable source code bundle contains code which shared a common purpose but doesn t perform any significant role in the systemd which means replacing it would not required changes to the systemd s overall architecture

1027989
python	ruby	python	java
java reflection causes many of the same problems you get with dynamically typed languages such as python and ruby

1027999
sql-server	mysql
tbh i d go with mysql although sql-server is by far the superior platform all things considered

1027999
sql-server	mysql
vb.net although it loves sql-server will happily talk to any oledb provider an odbc connection with no problems whatsoever and mysql s odbc support is pretty mature

1028004
quirks-mode	doctype
sharepoint uses quirks-mode the html doesn t defined a doctype .so adding a doctype means plenty of fiddling with the shipped css styles to get it all working

1028035
callback	methods
the private methods call preg_replace_callback but is seems that callback need to be public on object .so i m stuck breaking out of the private world and exposing implementation details .when i d rather not

1028035
callback	methods
.so in a nutshell can i use an instances methods as a callback without losing encapsulation

1028036
rollback	commit
if no errors then i would begin a database transactional commit the master recording and then read the master recording key back if its an insert then run thru each table commiting the child recordinging followed by a commit of the transactional or rollback if there were any problems saving child data

1028036
push	pull
they work great for simple utility types programs but .when you start creating a complex systemd using them you will find little gotchas along the way that are easily solved by using a standards edit and a function to push pull data to from the database

1028049
combinations	permutation
using such a tree limits what can be produced without having to pre-generate all combinationss since you don t need to pre-construct the entire tree it can be construct as the permutation are generator and you re guaranteed to complete because of the purging of the nodes you re only traversal links to nodes .when that s an allowed combinations for an unproduced permutation

1028050
put	get
you can get it to work some of the time if you put spaces between the and the d

1028063
web-config	app-config
do you have an app-config or web-config in your project file with a connection-string refering to your instances

1028076
callback	methods
can you create a separate helpers class for text process and create the callback methods within that class it can be public there

1028090
web-services	security
i imagine the policy of generator the user-interface for asmx web-services only on the server itself was an attempt to provide some nice tooling while eliminating accidental security holes

1028107
shell	bash
updates i prefer to use the bash shell if possible

1028119
actionscript	mxml
mxml is just a way of writing actionscript without having to know actionscript

1028119
actionscript	mxml
.when flex creates the swf it looks at the mxml and creates actionscript from it behind the scenes

1028119
actionscript	mxml
for what it s worth as far as i know file size is not increased by using mxml as the mxml is converted to actionscript before the swf is created

1028185
export	csv	sdf	dbf
this utility has a dos user-interface but it allows you via the copy function on the menu to export entire dbf tables in sdf or csv format

1028187
cassini	iis
i ve been developing an asp.net 3.5 web application against cassini the built-in web-development-server rather than against iis

1028196
key-value	key
if you just need the value or the key not the key-value pair return these collections from the dictionary and use tolist as well

1028197
multiplication	addition
if an additive operation ie addition or multiplication on two or more int results in a smaller value than the operands then you know something went wrong

1028200
value	field
the value of this field is the zero-length string

1028225
output	mode
just a quote you don t need to close the terminal you can use the cmd reset to restore the terminal output mode

1028232
hosts-file	hosts
localhost is configurable in the hosts-file typically located at c windows system32 drivers etc hosts

1028235
contains	elements	contains	any
the file contains these rules are the last file import .so these rules should overrides any others though main_navigation is the only matching elements _anyway .so cascading stuff shouldn t matter

1028250
reactive-programming	frp
what does functional reactive-programming frp mean in practice

1028271
doubly-linked-list	priority-queue	hashtable	set
that list might be a singly doubly-linked-list an arrays a set a hashtable if you need to index your things based on a key a priority-queue if you need to sort it etc

1028271
python	java
these days in languages such as c# python java and many more you re usually abstracted away from having to implements your own lists

1028273
contains	elements
note that i ve also added a root elements in case your dictionary contains more than one elements and i m guessing that none of the dictionary key value is root

1028281
.when	ready
the alternative approach to release branching is to make all development changes to trunk and .when you are ready create a release tag branch

1028288
authentication	login
i m not sure what you mean by no need to login to edit document from libs that logged in user has access to. you can expose a document libs to anonymous users even if authentication users have specific privileges to it if that s what you mean

1028289
doubly-linked-list	linked-list
it is a doubly-linked-list but not a circular linked-list

1028298
contains	any
i m not in any way suggesting i want multiple-inheritance of implementation - but if we did have it along with its complexity then an abstract-class which just contains abstract-methods would accomplish almost everything that an interface does

1028302
tostring	charat
it has all methods needed to solve the problem charat setcharat length and tostring

1028309
abstract-class	subclassing
with abstract-class you can provide a common behavior to their subclassing witch you can t with interfaces

1028312
abstract-class	base-class	base-class	inherited
abstract-class provide a way to have a an object inherited from a defined contract as well as allowing behavior to be specified in the base-class

1028331
contains	any
abstract base classes may also contains non abstract-methods properties and field just like any normals class

1028331
base-class	inherited
c# let s you derive from one base-class only - single inherited just like java

1028344
environment	execution
you know that calling selected will produce a sequences of the same length as the original query source but nothing in the execution environment has that information as far as i m aware

1028375
configuration	logging
allow for the class-library to enable and configure logging via it s own configuration file if the calling application does not configure log4net

1028375
configuration	logging
allow for the class-library to enable and configuring logging via the calling applications configuration if it specifies log4net information

1028375
configuration	logging
allow for the class-library to enable and configuring logging using it s own configuration file at all time

1028375
log4net-configuration	log4net
how do you configure and enable log4net for a stand-alone class-library assembly .so that it will log regardless if the calling application provides log4net-configuration

1028394
ole-automation	com
sourcesafe exposes an ole-automation object-model also known as a com object-model and powershell can talk to com object

1028398
linux	unix
you don t say what systemd you re using but in many unix linux filesystemds the minimum unit of storage allocation is 4k which is why the size is showing as 4096

1028404
scala	java
if you have a very smart grouping you might consider scala since it s 100 java compatible and has a lot of advanced features but the problem with that is you are count on having scala developers in the future

1028420
python	ruby
ruby .net python each of those can be configure into different uses pretty easy

1028430
order	join
will probably use merge join methods which is super fast if both input rowset are sorted and its output is also sorted which means that order by comes free

1028438
red-black-tree	tree
b-tree red-black-tree bst or more advanced structures like suffix tree suffix arrays

1028444
checkbox	textbox
you can put both means of entry checkbox textbox in the same positioning by putting them both in a panels say stackpanels and setting the visibility of either the set of checkbox or textbox to collapse

1028444
radio-button	checkbox	radio-button	textbox	checkbox	textbox
there are several ways to accomplish this but my preferred approach would be to databind the checkbox and textbox to their respective radio-button s ischecked properties and use a ivalueconverter to convert between the boolean and visibility properties

1028448
value	field
i ve got a requirement to hold a datetime value in a sharepoint field but to customise the display in a listview .so that it show as a mmmm string

1028453
click	mouse
.so it looks like the pad hardware is just generator click as though it is a wheel mouse

1028468
append	input
let the datepicker write the base value of the input and have the timepicker append it s value following a spaces to the same input

1028468
append	input
append time-picker value with a preceding spaces to input value

1028472
contains	set
i m also getting some .obj folder that contains another set of debugging and release folder that seem out of place

1028504
web-applications	web-services
the web-services are exposed for each web application but i don t know how to using web-services enumerate all the web-applications and .so on down to the site level without having a list of all available web-applications in the first place

1028512
environment	building
you can see the various environment variables in the building transcript command-shift-b click the little text icons drag the building transcript up.

1028515
linked-list	arrays
another possible solution is to create a linked-list with the underlying data structure being an arrays

1028524
.when	ready
.when you get your triggers to reprocess your data work on it in the background with a copy and .when it s ready to redraw completely updates

1028527
emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate	vim
easily installable on multiple platform emacs eclipse vim textmate

1028528
scala	java
if you convert the java map to a scala map with the java types

1028557
jruby	mri
also it lacks a good jit compiler currently though mri 1.9 has a bytecode compiler which is better and jruby compiles it down to java bytecode which then can compile via the hotspot jvm s jit compiler but it ends up being about the same speed as 1.9

1028557
python	lua
if .so how do other languages like lua and python .solve these problems

1028570
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
.so this works great in firefox google-chrome safari opera mac windows

1028578
required	checked
excluding the solution that required checked if the click coordonates is in the bounds of the progress-bar has anyone found another solution or a workaround to this

1028582
arrays	loops	contains	any	enumerator	any
i would consider using a custom class contains an arrays or a list t internally and making a custom enumerator that starts at any index and enumerate around loops

1028584
scala	java
you ll have to folding the java map into the scala one try again using the scala boolean types

1028584
scala	java
then mm is a scala map contains the contents of the original scala map plus what was in the java map

1028600
visual-studio	release-mode
by default visual-studio generator pdb-files in both debugging and release-mode

1028605
contains	elements
is it possible to only have one flat list contains the two children elements instead of two sub-list

1028606
quicktime	qtkit
i ve been looking into the quicktime api qtkit and it looks promising but if there s a better way - one that could be extended to support live video streaming that d be amazing

1028621
arguments	default
note the second arguments to at ifabsent is similar to the default clause of a case-statement

1028623
istream	ostream
open input.txt as an istream and output.txt as a ostream

1028643
put	get
if you put it out of your implementation you get this warning warning instances variables is protected

1028645
xsl-fo	xslt
xml - xslt - xsl-fo

1028695
instances	private
.so change your public variables to the properties named tell vs to change all the instances of this variables then create a private variables to store the value and a public properties of the proper named

1028713
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
say you have an itemscontrol with an itemtemplate set to an instances of a custom control

1028713
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
the itemscontrol creates a contentpresenter for each item drops that into the itemspanel and rendering the itemtemplate within the contentpresenter

1028737
gnome	kde
i am trying to get a proof of concept going on any platform .so if you know how to do it on xp in gnome kde or mac os i would really like to hear about it

1028761
order	add
it is possible for instances to change the column order of a table in production or add or remove columns

1028765
execution	exit
.so it can be used as .soon as execution enters main and should not be accessed after executiuon exit main

1028765
constructor	object
though it technically may be avilable before this your usage of it in constructor destructor of global object should be tempered with the known problem of global variable-initialization order

1028766
scriptaculous	jquery
i recently started a project where the team decided we d like to use jquery rather than prototype scriptaculous for our javascript needs

1028767
configuration	logging
for my project these drawbacks outweighed the benefits of using a logging configuration supplied by the calling application .so i went with .solution 2

1028773
attributes	properties
i want to use the regular login-system in an asp.net .app but i want to use the user s email-address as their user named as is common in many web sites. however there seems to be no properties or attributes to allow me to do something like this

1028779
hash	md5
in the header file there should be a cc_md5 function that will compute an md5 hash of arbitrary data

1028779
nsstring	nsdata
some more info here including a wrapper using nsstring - should be easy enough to convert to use nsdata

1028785
pointers	stack
i have a smart pointers types and would like to construct an object that takes a pointers of that types and a count dynamically calculated at runtime and allocates enough memory from stack to hold that many instances of the object the smart pointers points to

1028815
double	int
double because you can cast int to

1028836
python	java
it can be awkward coming from java or python i did but once you get used to it it s just natural

1028879
associations	model
in your view or you can create another associations in your .post model something like

1028881
variables	boolean
you can checked a boolean member variables before each iterator

1028897
positioning	slider
if you actually want your new view to slider you can try animation both the size and the positioning and you ll also probably need to clip your animated view with another view

1028903
contains	any
it is written .so that any a tag with a class contains add is bound to the jquery function

1028905
textchanged	textbox
how can i get textbox dynamically added to webcontrol to save it s text in viewstate and get textchanged event to fire

1028905
textchanged	textbox
i would greatly appreciate an example of webcontrol code-behind with textbox being added dynamically and textchanged event being fired

1028930
linux	osx	directory	folder
if you ve previously checked out into this directory there could be a hidden .svn folder folder prefixed with dot are the equivalent of hidden in linux osx

1028931
lgpl	gpl
since i want to call the libs from within another open-source software with a bsd-ish license i would prefer lgpl over gpl

1028936
getter	setter
.so we auto-generate code by selected a table from the database using the cf admin api and create the dao with the usual init setter and getter .so the basic crud stuff

1028936
value	field
however the base-class it extends has .some very useful generics functions that come for free such as getfieldlistbyproperties which based on passed parameters will return certain field table columns by a certain properties a column value .so for example

1028938
display	width
now the texts that i display can be large enough to fit inside one cell width .so it display the texts on the second line

1028946
linux	unix
the most powerful features in these areas are available in the enterprise versioning of the db2 data engine for linux unix and windows

1028949
any	set
for this rea.son value-type must always be immutable make all member variables readonly .so that they can only be set in the constructor and do not have any mutable types as members

1028959
dictionary	arrays
an arrays set or dictionary go

1028962
fflush	gets
now my problem is .when a person object gets fflush it tries to execute a collections remove action against person#thincollections which fails because it s trying to execute

1028967
getter	setter
what conventions do you use to comment getter and setter

1028967
getter	setter
now i could see for something more complex you might write more in the a parts to give context but for a majority of the getter setter out there the wording is almost exactly the same

1028967
getter	setter
i m just curious if for the simple getter setter its ok to only fill in either the a part or the b part

1028981
getter	setter
getter and setter ought to be self-explanatory

1028988
getter	setter
edit the above refers to getter and setter only

1028993
getter	setter
i usually just fill the param part for setter and the return part for getter

1028996
getter	setter
i d say only worry about commenting getter and setter if they have some sort of side effect or required some sort of precondition outside of initialization getting will remove an item from a data structure or inorder to set something you need to have x and y in-place first

1028997
children	nodes
and any nodes p with no children is a leaf .

1028997
children	nodes	children	tree	traversal	parent
the solution you specify with parent contains references to children and vice versa eliminates the need to traversal the tree to obtain ancestry of a given child and children of a nodes

1028997
children	tree
i suggest reading the tree chapter in the art of computer programming for an excellent and in-depth look at tree structures and efficient ways to enumerate parentage and children

1029005
groovy	java
i recently configure groovy 1.6 w java 6 into my ant build.xml scripting .so that it compiles everything through groovy with the embedded javac cmd

1029010
value	field
i have been running this stored procedure for some time mapping it to my object using linq-to-sql and now all of the sudden linq is trying to cast the field value as double

1029016
constructor	object
i am not sure how you do that for a mysql-python connection i guess you either set an arguments to the connection constructor or set a properties after creating the connection object

1029019
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	postgresql	rdbms	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
if you are using a decent rdbms like mysql postgresql sql-server oracle etc.

1029033
qwidget	qimage
the server send the image data using image.tostring and the client side receives it and turns it back into an image using image.fromstring then into a qimage using imageqt.imageqt image turns it into a qpixmap using qpixmap.fromimage qimage then updates my qwidget s qlable s image using lable.setpixmap qpixmap

1029053
value	field
id is field list of the sql statement with a value of 5

1029058
getter	setter
.when documenting setter getter i like to separate the what from the encoding

1029079
solaris	linux
the install needs to support mulitple os s - solaris linux and windows

1029080
environment	execution
to blur the line somewhat further pl sql code stored-procedures package as well as anonymous blocks may contains a call to the dbms_output package that produces output but this output is only visible if execution from a client environment that can receive the output

1029102
.net	wcf
if you can move up to .net 3.5 you could use wcf instead of remoting

1029109
firefox	safari
with it and selenium rc you can puppet string ie firefox or safari from inside of perl

1029119
png	gif
where profile.avatarmimetypes is an appropriate mime types for a gif jpeg or png

1029127
directory	folder
positioning of normals files and folder is stored in the hidden .ds_store file that exists for any directory

1029132
nsscrollview	nstextview
i m looking for some kind of a basic straightforward example of how to work with a pair of nsscrollers in an nsscrollview with a custom nstextview

1029132
imageview	textview
there are sporadic examples out there largely consisting of contrived examples using programatically created interfaces or based on the assumption that the developer is working with a typical imageview or textview

1029132
nsscrollview	nstextview
essentially i have a subclassing nstextview enbedded in an nsscrollview per the scoll view guide that a user can click in the view to create edit and delete object much like an illustration program

1029132

i have a sql-server query that i need to convert to mysql

1029145
selected	button	populate	row
.when the form loads the grid is not populate drop down to selected a supplier and button to view alias and there is a single row display with the in the tab

1029145
populate	row
however .when i populate the grid i no longer have this insert row for adding to the collections

1029159
perl	php
how can i i.solate and replace only the capture strings .so that i end up with is is a in both php and perl

1029160
keyboard	mouse
your test .application is a simple .app or scripting that starts up your gui and then generator mouse keyboard events based on input files

1029160
keyboard	mouse
with any luck you ll be able to generator mouse and keyboard events with the api but you ll have to ask someone else if it s possible

1029160
click	mouse
.when your scripting execute that cmd it will click the mouse on that button

1029169
for-loop	arrays
you ve created empty arrays lists in the for-loop .so trying access any elements in them return null to system.out.println

1029171
duplicates	contains
this application contains a duplicates sets a assemblies in different folder

1029199
asp.net-mvc	wcf	silverlight	wpf
i d argue that asp.net-based applications make this problem worse as not only is the core language changing dramatically every few years but new technologies wpf silverlight xaml wcf asp.net-mvc that influence your application are coming out all the time

1029201
joystick	hid
you could modify this sample drivers to emulate a joystick hid device and then send out joystick hid report from the drivers

1029204
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
i am using sphinx with the thinking-sphinx plugins to search my data

1029244
dictionary	hashmap
you definitely want a hashmap which is the java versioning of c# dictionary

1029245
primitive	int
note that you can t use int or any other primitive types as a generics types-parameter but because of autoboxing it still behaves almost as if it were a instead of a

1029269
contains	elements
the soap fault elements can have an optional faultdetail sub-elements and this can contains arbitrary xml document such as your getlisterror

1029270
binary	hex
alternatively you could manually building a hex string prefixed with 0x to create a binary literals to append to the query but it s not recommended

1029302
keyboard	mouse
xdotool lets you programatically or manually simulate keyboard input and mouse activity move and resize windows etc

1029302
xlib	x11
it does this using x11 s xtest extension and other xlib functions

1029331
getter	setter
the r o will only have getter while the writable will inherited from it and add the setter

1029340
bmp	gif
i ve seen similar questions that answer how you might do this with image files jpg bmp gif etc but i haven t found a way that works with pdf

1029348
revision	svn
the code for the deref -method of an agent looks like this svn revision 1382

1029354
any	set
you don t have to make iis do this -- you could have any page where you can set the response codes and headers request ntlm

1029358
protected	public
mark the setter as protected in the parent and expose public setter in the child

1029379
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have used it with the old versioning and the asp.net-mvc templates in webforms using the following initialization

1029382
decimal	hex
your hex addresses are ipv6 the 4 decimal numbers ones are ipv4

1029391
put	get
as a side note my reasoning for wanting this is because i have graphic designers who put files into svn but they don t get added to the project and don t show up on deployment or deployment testing

1029419
versioning	upgrade
if you plan on using gem with systemd ruby you might have problems .when apple upgrade the systemd versioning of ruby unless you are installing your gem in libs rubygem

1029435
python	php
i have quite a few years experience of developing php web-applications and have recently started to delve into python as well

1029435
python	php
something in python or php would be great but i d be happy to learn something else if it has big advantages

1029440
safari	opera
crossbrowser object watch claims support for ie opera safari

1029440
safari	opera
opera safari

1029452
value	field
your other option is a custom field where you can run c# code to determine the value of the field based on your particular requirements

1029467
getter	setter
those methods are called setter and getter

1029467
getter	setter
by convenction setter and getter have the same named of the instances variables but this is not a requirement

1029486
python	java
python and java are both excellent for working on both linux and windows environment

1029486
python	php
python for creating desktop apps is fairly simple and easy to learn as well if you re coming from a php background especially if you re used to doing object oriented php

1029497
linux	bsd
sadly macports iteself is somewhat inferior to package-managers offered on bsd linux distributions

1029501
attributes	properties
if this properties is true the applications quits .when the last visible primary windows windows with no parent with the qt wa_quitonclose attributes set is closed

1029503
keyboard	mouse
.when i get bored of calling one common feature with the mouse i get the keyboard shortcut quickly

1029504
nsthread	cocoa
although cocoa provides the nsthread api it is essentially a wrapper on the pthreads s api

1029506
put	get
put it where you can t reach it and try to get along

1029527
any	set
clients should drop the connection if they receive bitfields that are not of the correct size or if the bitfield has any of the spare bits set

1029550
double	int
i have no problem doing this for an int divide by 16 recursively and concatenation chars 0-9a-f but float double is stumping me

1029571
jquery	dojo
checked if some libs like dojo and jquery help support this situation

1029577
panels	grid
i am working on the labels for the axies and i am experimenting with the use of a elements in the itemtemplate - but i have no idea how the grid is supposed to function in this context and msdn says nothing about the panels in their sample code

1029584
contains	set
either set path env-var or the java.library.path properties to contains the dir with your file or store your dll where java finds it by default many options here depending on deployment strategy and platform

1029599
constructor	object
also .when you create an arraysaccess object by setting a flag in the constructor you can read and write an object as either an arrays or an object

1029605
uisegmentedcontrol	uiswitch
i would recommend creating a custom control or an arrays of uiswitch controls representing each of the options in your uisegmentedcontrol

1029622
ienumerator	ienumerable
nope ienumerator and ienumerable are different beasts entirely

1029632
ienumerator	ienumerable
the basic reason you can t go that directions ienumerator t to a ienumerable t is that ienumerable t represents a set that can be enumerated but ienumerator t is a specific enumeratation over a set of items -- you can t turn the specific instances back into the thing that created it

1029637
xlutils	xlwt
there are three python modules that allow you to do pretty much anything you need xlrd reading xlwt writing and xlutils copy modify filtering

1029638
show	next
.so i ve set up a paginator systemd similar to twitter s where where 20 results are show and the user can click a link to show the next twenty or all results

1029661
database-table	mysql
i have a mysql database-table that will store location for buildings and events and a few other things

1029661
latitude-longitude	location
however the problem comes with .some things having a single location .so 1 latitude-longitude but .some like a tracking has a numbers of latitude-longitude positioning and .something like a large stadium might have a polygons over it

1029666
display	height
i have an elements its css display is set to none its height is set to 20px and margin-top set to zero pixels

1029666
display	height
then i want it to set display to block and animate its height and margins to the value as defined in the css - 20px - to slider and reveal itself

1029677
latitude-longitude	location	lookup	any
since you re not doing any lookup on the location and you re using i m assuming google-maps api the simplest solution would probably be to encode a list of latitude-longitude as json and store in a varchar column

1029686
webserver	upload
i ve personally used the latter methods in an application that needed to upload images to a webserver

1029704
itemscontrol	grid
it s just that itemscontrol and its descendant listbox will create multiple-instances of your grid

1029707
selected	button	selected	cell
i don t need to know .when the entire cell is selected just .when a particular button is pressed .so i need to know which row it is .so i can updates the proper object

1029709
value	field
selected field value not equals and then types in name2

1029711
radio-button	checkbox
however since i want this function to be responsible for all the initialization of this class .when being created and it contains mfc object initializations such as combobox edit control checkbox control radio-button control etc. should i be instead calling the initializer function here as i thought

1029711
constructor	object
currently i have non-mfc memory and object initialization in the constructor hence calling iniitalize helpers function in the constructor and mfc object iniitalization in the oniniitalupdate handler function

1029712
margins	padding
try using padding rather than margins

1029724
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
there are other 3rd party mechanisms out there that you may prefer over the uikit uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontroller mechanisms

1029742
cursor	row
put your cursor in the first row column and try this

1029751
constructor	object
and if you are wondering how those object are getting deleted if indeed they are getting deleted the answer is that the this-pointer within the constructor of qshortcut should have the same value as that returned by new and that can be passed to a shortcutmanager

1029773
keyboard	mouse
to add to subtenante response since i don t have enough mojo to actually comment there if i find myself using the mouse do something repetitively my threshold is 3 time ie the third time i notice myself mousing the same task i lookup to the keyboard shortcut and do that a couple time as practice immediately

1029779
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i can create it this way fine as long as i change the myviewcontroller to inherited from uiviewcontroller instead of uinavigationcontroller

1029798
class-instance-variables	class-variables
be paranoid about class-variables and class-instance-variables

1029798
class-variables	metaclass	class-instance-variables	class-variables	class-instance-variables	metaclass
this means any object referenced from your classes and metaclass such as class-variables and class-instance-variables will be shared across request

1029798
class-instance-variables	class-variables
this may bite you if you save stuff in your class-variables or class-instance-variables during request

1029798
class-instance-variables	class-variables
this may bite you if you pass information around in class-variables or in class-instance-variables

1029800
dictionary	map
it should be trivial to map this into a function dictionary list etc

1029806
equality-operator	operands
the equality-operator checked whether two operands are the same and returns true if they are the same and false if they are different

1029810
value	field
the second way and perhaps the most simiple is to just have the value in the subtyping be field in the supertype that can be null

1029840
subtract	add
my knowledge of excel sums goes only a wee bit further than add and subtract

1029849
linux	bsd
i m doing udp with recvmsg and on linux i can get the tos if i setsockopt ip_recvtos ipv6_recvtclass but ip_recvtos doesn t seem to be available on my bsd systemd

1029849
freebsd	bsd	solaris	bsd	solaris	freebsd
and since solaris and bsd working with freebsd at the moment don t have ip_recvtos from what i can see i don t get tos .when looping over the cmsg data

1029879
model-view-controller	domain-driven-design	model-view-controller	repository-pattern	domain-driven-design	repository-pattern
lookup things such as domain-driven-design inversion-of-control test driven development repository-pattern model-view-controller memcached velocity queue msmq database mail queue etc

1029890
python	php
are there any php alternatives to edgewall s trac solution which works on python and not really portable

1029893
exponentiation	modulo
another funny one at least for the named is the blum blum shub generator bbs that is unusual for normals prngs because it relies on exponentiation in modulo arithmetic giving a security comparable to other algorithms like rsa and el gamal in breaking the sequences also if i m not sure about the proof of it

1029894
debian-based	linux
sometimes .when i install a debian-based systemd i change the userid start option i forget its named i m not on linux now from 1000 to 500 for consistency with the other red hat-y machines

1029895
declarative	imperative
if i understand it is as why is it that css is a declarative language rather then imperative then it s because it s conceptually closer to how humans want webpage to be styled and how browsers feel comfortable reading it

1029910
stdin	pipe
black-box 3rd-party .app is failing ftp for some reason. once run the middleman will fork redirect stdout and stdin to from pipe that the parent has control of and then execute the program in usr bin

1029921
debian	linux
easy to set up on linux debian

1029944
directory	folder
it doesn t required a server of any sort -- it s completely python based and the source control is kept within a .bzr folder at the top directory of the tree

1029944
ftp	ssh
you can also work just with local files on your filesystems or you can push your changes to a remote-server over ssh ftp http or a bzr-specific server

1029955
contains	elements
the contentpresenter gets it s content from the datacontext but i need the binding on contains elements to link to original windows user-controls s parent in logical tree datacontext - because this way .when i embed textbox bound to viewmodel s properties it is not bound as the inherited chaining has been broken inside the control

1029955
children	tree
it seems that i would need to save parent s datacontext and restore it to the children of all control s containers but i don t get any event that datacontext up in the logical tree has changed

1029960
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp comes with its own templates libs is there a similar feature in codeigniter

1029961
value	field
sphinx handles sorting on string field by storing all the value in a list sorting the list and then storing the index of each string as an int attributes

1029992
equality-operator	operands
logically a microprocessor does not need to compare all the bits of both operands of an equality-operator inorder to determine a false result

1029993
firefox	safari
as of now rounded corners are supported in firefox and safari through browser-extension

1029993
firefox	safari
rounded corner is a part of css3 specifications .so if you want to implements a rounded corner using pure css and html now it is possible only using browser extensions -moz-border-radius for firefox -webkit for safari

1029996
function-call	inline
the inline keyword is simply a compiler flag that tells it to handle it differently in that it will copy the body of the function and replace it with the actual function-call

1030009
display	height
as describe in this question it appears the minimum row height for a row in a datagridview winform not wpf is 17 if you wish to display checkbox in a datagridviewcheckboxcell

1030017
background-image	height	margins	padding
either you can create the appearance of equals height by setting a background-image on the tablerow elements the faux columns technique or you can make the height of the columns match by giving each a large padding and equalsly large negative margins

1030017
margins	padding
here s an example using the padding margins technique to balance the height of the columns

1030017
margins	padding
this barcamp demo by natalie downe may also be useful .when figuring out how to add additional columns and nice spacing and padding equals height columns and other tricks it s also where i first learnt about the margins padding trick to balance column height

1030018
any	set
location.hash seems to be utterly broken in safari 4 it can be set initially but cannot be set in any event as far as i can tell whether that event is triggers by a user action or a timer

1030030
temporary	copy
one important discovery i made was that i need to copy my member variables into a temporary variables before i act on it in case some other call to the object tries to swap in a new sound before i am finished cleaning up the previous one

1030032
32-bit	64bit
the size of the poll arrays is probably 16 bytes - on most but not all machines 32-bit and 64bit

1030041
value	field
i m trying to produce an if conditional statement inside of a selected new that checked the value of two field inorder to fill a properties

1030062
xquery	xslt
it s also instructive to look at the saxon xslt xquery processor since being a well-behaved xml application it has to take into account how java stores codepoints in strings

1030078
attributes	properties
.when i created the datamodel i noticed that an attributes can be marked as and identity properties

1030103
value	field
however .when creating the enum you must specify the value for each enum member .so it makes a .sort of bit field

1030106
google-chrome	safari
this doesn t happen in ie8 safari 4 or google-chrome 2

1030112
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
it isn t magic it is a uinavigationcontroller that initializer a uiviewcontroller internally a uitableview that is populate with your address book contact and sets the uiviewcontroller as its root view

1030120
moving-average	average
while it gives an exponentially decaying average rather than a total average i think you may want what i called an exponential moving-average with varying alpha which is really a single-pole low-pass filtering

1030125
vbscript	jscript
i see vbscript wsh powershell cmd jscript etc and wondering what to learn or what combinations of things

1030128
internet-explorer	firefox
ok finally i have tested in internet-explorer it works it did al.so work on previous versioning of firefox .so it seems to be a firefox 3.0.11 bug

1030145
deployment	install
in some cases the customer elects to allow our application to be deployed locally to user machines and bypass the citrix server in one case we ve provided a static install for a customer to use with the proviso that updates would not be pushed automatically and in some cases our customer it departments have had the technical savvy to make the clickonce deployment work in their citrix environment

1030165
subclassing	inherited
you should reserve inherited for things that are genuinely subclassing not just to add some functionality here and there

1030176
parametric-polymorphism	polymorphism
where you need polymorphism use parametric-polymorphism via generics rather than implicit types polymorphism via subclassing

1030177
google-chrome	opera
tried google-chrome and opera and they both work

1030196
getter	setter
a jsf model-bean should be a pojo that follows the javabeans design pattern with getter setter encapsulating properties

1030196
getter	setter
although it typically has javabean-style properties with associated getter setter these are properties of the view -- not of the underlying application datamodel

1030206
shell	bash
bash uses the gnu readline libs for the shell prompt and history

1030217
json	xml
i came across how to convert xml to json in asp.net c# link and one in javascript at goessner.net downloading prj jsonxml

1030246
ironpython	ironruby
there is ironpython ironruby and others

1030246
groovy	java
many of the java scripting languages such as groovy can be made operational under .net via ikvm

1030250
subtract	time
to perform a task repeatedly n time put n onto the tape perform the task once then subtract 1 from the end of the numbers n

1030263
versioning	upgrade
typically you want to say libraryx is at versioning 2.32 and will stay that way until i tell it to upgrade

1030263
linux	unix
if you are on unix linux then i suggest just a bash scripting

1030293
logout	login	registration	logout	registration	login
please advise me a simple user management systemd with user registration user login user logout session create manage destroy with data store

1030308
instances	destroy
assuming the instances is actually destroy and not leaked this will tell you at the time the object is destroy if the contract was correctly followed

1030312
firefox	opera
it could explain why you can hit the site with firefox and opera but not with ie or webclient

1030349
user-input	output	combinations	permutation
this program takes 2 numbers from user-input asks them whether they d like to find out the permutation or combinations and then output the result

1030363
combinations	permutation
you should explicit initializer top_fac and bottom_fac to 1 at the beginning of the permutation and combinations functions

1030419
sms-gateway	kannel
i ve read about and install kannel a free sms-gateway

1030422
cosine	sin
generally you can do it with sin and cosine but for specific angle like this you can do it just by knowing pythagorean triangle

1030429
cos	sin
at 45 angle value of cos sin is same i.e 1 root 2

1030432
cos	sin
crazy fact from the 1980s in the old days we used lookup tables for sin and cos

1030459
system-tray	trayicon
the newly added system-tray and trayicon classes of the java.awt package can be used to add icons to the system-tray

1030459
click	mouse
the icons can respond to mouse click and use popup menus as well

1030459
swing	awt
however this new functionality is a part of awt .so it doesn t do a very good job integration with swing components

1030459
system-tray	trayicon
here s an example of a little clock that show up in the system-tray which was made using the system-tray and trayicon classes in java 6

1030467
backwards-compatibility	legacy
say that there are legacy files stored in such a manner but need to be loaded into versioning 2.0 of the application for backwards-compatibility using the following newer datamodel

1030469
scriptaculous	jquery
judging by your latency requirement of 2 seconds it would be wise to look at some sort of ajax framework - jquery or prototype scriptaculous are both good places to start

1030478
exception-handling	try-catch
if you suspect that foo.dispose is throw an exception-handling i would dispose of it last if possible and wrap it in try-catch

1030479
primitive	int
my usecase needs to create wrapper int objects...meaning no primitive int...and the converted data is used for readonly

1030510
silverlight	wpf
there is the wmpbitmapdecoder class for regular wpf applications but i don t see anything like that .when i create a silverlight application

1030522
contains	elements
i m using python 2.x not negotiable to read xml document created by others that allow the content of many elements to contains characters that are not valid xml characters by escaping them using the _xhhhh_ conventions ascii bel aka u+0007 is represented by the 7-character sequences u _x0007_

1030522
celementtree	lxml
i m parsing the document using celementtree or lxml semi-negotiable

1030524
contains	set
for example i made a simple swc that contains a symbols with it s class set to testcircle

1030528
exception-handling	try-catch
you should putting the line that is failing in a try-catch then if there is an exception-handling pause for say half a sec and then re-try again

1030618
qapplication	qobject	qobject	qevent
you can use the qapplication postevent function to send custom qevent messages to a qobject to be process in the gui thread with the qobject customeevent handler

1030622
templating	jinja2
i ve seen a lot mentioned about templating engines include zedshaw talking about using jinja2 in lamson

1030622
genshi	mako	jinja2	mako	jinja2	genshi
.so i thought i would ask the community to provide me with .some advice as to where .when i might know i should consider using a templating-engine such as jinja2 genshi mako and co

1030631
imperative	frp
frp is also unusual in that it is concurrent without running afoul of the theoretical pragmatic rats nest that plagues imperative concurrency

1030631
imperative-programming	frp
while concurrency adds enormous complexity to imperative-programming due to nondeterministic interleaving it is effortless in frp

1030639
value	field
.when a link is click default value are stored in the table for these field

1030639
value	field
its value is either 0 or 1 .so i initially created it as a binary field

1030639
value	field
all the other field s value get stored except for the required field

1030691
postgresql	oracle
e.g using to_char in oracle or text in postgresql or the equivalent in your database you do not specify

1030697
json	xml
i ve used yaptu or adaptations thereof to smoothly switching between json xml and human-readable html actually output for example

1030701
windows-server	windows-xp
will it be possible for windows-xp or windows-server 2003 to support net.tcp for wcf well it works in windows-server 2008 as iis 7.0 supports net.tcp but is there anyway for iis 5.1 or iis 6.0 to support net.tcp is there any workaround for this

1030702
contains	set
a list of genres each contains a list of location each contains a list of qualities each contains either a set of data including url or just a url

simply put templating lets you easily write a human-readable document by hand and add very simple markup to identify areas that should be replace by variables area that should repeat etc

1030736
perl	php
i want to use perl libs from a php application

1030737
pylons	django
i was helping to develop django based web .app i created rather simple pylons project - but writing web .apps and creating programs in languages such as c++ is two different things

1030737
python	c++
creating simple working example in python takes little time - .when i first switched to c++ it took hours before my program would compile run and do what it was meant to do

1030764
multiplication	division
the performance cost of multiplication division square root etc operations for embedded systemd

1030766
subclassing	base-class
my base-class has properties that are used by a subclassing

1030766
base-class	inherited
in the original base-class or the class that inherited it

1030788
subclassing	superclass
if you re retaining it in the subclassing for some reason you should also release it in the subclassing but setting the properties to nil in the superclass shouldn t have any negative side-effects

1030799
localization	translation
fwiw i have uses tsilang translation suite in the past and am currently working on another project using the localization tools shipped with devexpress vcl

1030802
primitive	int
note 3 if you are creating an int .so you can put it in a collections you can avoid this by using gnu trove trove4j which allows you to store primitive in collectionss allowing you to drop the int creation as well

1030803
selected	button
that is automatically checked has to be selected onclientclick of edit button in gride view..can anyone tell that code...thank you

1030806
subclassing	base-class
.so subclassing class should release it s properties and base-class release it s own

1030806
subclassing	base-class
once subclassing is release it will not access base-class properties it technically does not exists anymore

1030824
versioning	upgrade
did you upgrade versioning on your server

.when the user is inactive for say 15 minutes i need to logout the user and redirect him to the login page if he is trying to use the application after the session has expired

1030915
debugging	trace
the only suggestion i would make is to use strace trace systemd call and signals though this is more of a debugging tool and does affect the performance of the process being traced

1030923
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
if your developing on windows case-insensitive and upload files to a nix server case-sensitive this would easily lead to file-not-found errors

1030925
value	field
.so as you see the rowdatabound event is the one responsible for writing the right value in the templates field

1030927
derived-class	base-class
why does the derived-class have to declare its methods as virtual for dynamic-binding to work even though the methods of the base-class are declare virtual

1030942
show	next
to improve performance you could make your client caching results and furthermore you could make your code request the next and previous pages after the current one has been fetched .so that they can be show instantly on request

1030962
constructor	object
i cannot create an instances of my derived-class since i can t construct the object with a constructor

1030968
factorization	primes
with a list of primess sqrt n dividing m it is easy to find the factorization of m since there is at most one primes larger than sqrt n

1030981
derived-class	base-class
if a methods is declare virtual in a base-class overrides it in a derived-class makes the overrides function virtual as well even if the virtual keyword is not used

the purpose is to be able to animate rotation through an obtuse angle of arc greater than 180 degrees rather than having the animation cheat and go the shortest route via the opposite acute smaller angle -- which can happen .when there s only one i.e destination keyframe

1031177
animation	rotation
as i understand it iâ m not looking for animation along a path since thatâ s for translation rather than rotation .

1031192

cross platform refers to things working on many different platform .so that may be os or cpu types x86 mips or bit size 32 64

1031229
32-bit	64bit
this is mainly useful if you directly call into external .dll s and you hard link the 64bit or 32-bit versioning and therefore only want your application to run in the same environment

1031229
32-bit	64bit
on the install front windows 64bit can run 32-bit applications and 32-bit install where-as 64bit applications cannot run on 32-bit systemd

1031329
firefox	safari
it works great on firefox and safari

1031335
httpwebrequest	webclient
but the only way to get at the httpwebrequest before it is sent is to inherited from webclient and overrides that methods

you can then use jquery a neat javascript libs that makes a lot of things easier .when writing client-side code to show and hide the tooltip with the following code

1031397
hide	show
if the above code looks like jibberish to you take a look at the jquery documentation and especially the hover and show hide functions

1031400
hide	show
what you want is put the content you want to hide show inside a tag invisible by default by setting the display hidden

1031408

1031530
getter	setter
i am writing a class that has lots of getter and setter and was wondering on what people thought about the following

1031537
entity-framework	data-access
the idea is that if we ever ditch linq then we can instead use a different data-access technology entity-framework plain ol sql etc.

1031551
getter	setter
i think magic getter setter of php5 are really helpful .when dealing with numerous getter setter

1031562

actionscript	mxml	attributes	properties
i then have my actionscript component where i concatenation three text attributes and set them as the text properties on the mxml text component

1031585
command-line	cmd
you could use java runtime-object to run the command-line cmd that suit your needs

1031605
constructor	object
an implication of this is that a partially construct object think exception-handling throw in constructor has its vtable set up to the points the construction proceeded to

1031614
google-chrome	firefox
obviously firefox and google-chrome work perfectly

1031615
google-chrome	firefox

assign	add
assign a class to all anchor tags you want to have anchor text then use a jquery selectedor to selected only those links and add a tooltip by setting the title attributes of the tag

1031638
derived-class	base-class
iirc what commonly happens is that the base-class constructor is called then the vtable pointers is set to the base-class then the first derived-class constructor is called etc

1031650
derived-class	base-class
you should be able to declare an enum in a base-class and then change the value per derived-class

1031669
numeric	digits
you will need to parsing the digits and then perform numeric comparison

1031676
constructor	object
the new-operators call operators new for the types of object being created then initializer the object s v-table and call the object s constructor

1031677

1031690
value	field
before requery i can get value of id field

1031690
triggers	insert	value	field
however after requery id field returns value of id field of the other table recording insert by triggers

1031692
numeric	digits
what about matching the digits and then doing a numeric comparison

1031705
restart	exit
i want windows to restart the service .when the sys.ext cause the service to exit

1031734
triggers	insert
i am not familiar with adoquery but as you are saying that you are getting an id of the table affected by triggers while expecting to get id of the original table perhaps it is a matter of using equivalent function to sql scope_identity see best way to get identity of insert row

1031734
triggers	insert
it seems that the problem is related to the fact that the ado query itself is useing identity to get the id of added recording while it should have really use scope_identity that has implications .when you have triggers insert data into another table which contains identity columns as it is in your case - see link above for details of scope_identity and identity

1031759
environment	building
the most valuable time will be spent on verifying the last two points recreate a complete a building environment from version-control and building test deliver from the new owner s machine

1031762
getter	setter
this allows you to implements an observers on any variables and to add automatic range checked of arbitrary complexity to any variables as if you were accessing the variables via a setter getter

1031772
deployment	install
the deployment will be done via an install verifying the versioning on each run

1031798
coalesce	isnull
there is nothing wrong with isnull nor with coalesce

1031803
hide	show
in those cases where you don t want the user to be able to see selected other value you should hide the dropdown and show a static text containers instead labels

1031822
execution	exit
for instances if you have stopped at a breakpoints and then press stop the code doesn t carry on execution to termination - it just exit

1031823
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
my thoughts on this is to have a checkbox by the save button which states my .profile is complete which the user will selected once they are happy with it and i have another module which creates a triggers by using the nodes_api hook and checked the types of the nodes the action and the value of this checkbox

1031823
value	field
i have also looked at using the same nodes_api hook to manipulate the .profile as it is being display however the nodes just seems to have the value for the field and not a form object that can be manipulated as i would have expected

1031847
identity-column	database-table	identity-column	sql-server
the only way you could guarantee that the bigint is unique within the database-table is to let sql-server generator it for you - make it an identity-column

1031870
any	set
set it to simple and then cancel any key presses

1031884
http	ssl
http or ssl can be made sufficiently secure by choosing appropriate key lengths hashing scheme ciphers c a subject of which i know little

put each of the begins and ends into a data structure with timestamp and another field whose value will be +1 for begin and -1 for end

1032041
javascript	dom
would building the html manually within javascript be the most efficient way performancewise i assume this is true over using functions like appendto etc or would creating a hidden construct within the dom and then cloning it be better

1032052
selected	button
i need to put button at selected city

1032101
deployment	install
i have created a setup and deployment project using the visual-studio and install the setup

1032136
margins	padding
a complex html document huge dom tree many embedded object with a complex styles floats positioning margins padding will probably need multiple rendering runs

1032174
.when	ready
.when your datagrid is updating add your loader on top of it and remove it .when your data is ready

1032175
primitive	boolean
there exists a threading primitive manualresetevent to do precisely this task - you don t want to be using a boolean flag

1032178
pagespeed	yslow
to improve page loading speed i d use a tool such as yslow or pagespeed to indicate more obvious areas for improvement

1032197
external	embed
if you use external fonts be sure to embed both normals and bold fonts

1032203
put	get
afterwards you might get a columntype problem as you re trying to put a string value into a int column

1032205
selected	cell
i want to selected april and store 3 in the cell but still display april as the selecteded value

1032214
ruby-on-rails	grails

1032214
configuration	installation
then you can start to focus on your business not on configuration and installation issues

1032227
bison	yacc
these actions are in c because the definition is intended for bison yacc which produces a c source file

1032241
xhtml	tidy
that s fair enough - i m asking it to tidy up the xhtml .so i d expect it to report what problems it s encountered

1032241
xhtml	tidy
i ve found that the excellent third party html tidy application can clean up this xhtml fine but i d expect nsxmldocumenttidyhtml to be able to just add some quotes around cellpadding value

1032277
windows-xp	windows
i developed a windows service which is running without any problem in windows-xp service pack 3

1032279
required	checked
you could use a regular expression as kevin points out but doing the validation you required checked that the value is a valid datetime object and within the specified range will be difficult to do cleanly

1032282
hide	show
no need of destroying it just show hide it

1032282
hide	show
.so as suggest in a here is an example where all controls are put in panels using sizer as separate help cntrl is created which can be show hidden from button but you can create a custom cntrl which hide itself on click close

1032288
n-gram	words
a words level or a character level n-gram

1032288
similarity	distance
my approach do the following with a wikipedia article for dogs and basketball building the n-gram vectors for both document normalize them calculate manhattan euclidian distance the closer the result is to 1 the higher is the similarity

1032290
xmpp	irc
in the mean time do it the xmpp irc etc.-way no peer-to-peer connection but websocket connections to a central server or network

virtualbox is a great virtual-machine solution

1032336
design-view	designer
since i ll already have a datatemplate that can transform my poco into a wpf visual tree is there any way to get the visual-studio designer to play along and have the design-view show me the poco+datatemplate s resulting gui as i edit the poco s xaml

1032336
design-view	designer
obviously the designer wouldn t know how to edit the design-view

1032354
virtualbox	vmware	virtualization	virtualbox	virtualization	vmware
everyone seems to be suggesting virtualbox but in my opinion you can t beat vmware at the virtualization game

1032354
virtual-machine	vmware
i would get a copy of vmware it s free for non-commercial use and you d be hard pressed to find one cheaper than that then use this website here to create yourself a virtual-machine to whatever specifications you need

1032366
sqltransaction	rollback
i want to perform some logging .when a sqltransaction is committed or rollback

1032367
n-gram	words

i am looking for a simple solution to do exception-handling logging combined with error-handling in my asp.net-mvc 1.0 application

1032379
puts	gets
an associativity arrays used for chaching but it does not preload all data but gets data from database if needed and puts it in the associativity arrays

1032392
attributes	properties
specifically i think you are looking for the browsable attributes which enables properties in visual-studio s design-time properties dialogue

1032425
arrays	loops
is the only and best possible way to accomplish this to simply loops through the datatable until it s empty and add each value to an arrays of int

1032442
boolean	int
since b ooleans are a subtyping of plain int source you can sum the list of int quite easily and you can also pass true boolean into this function as well

1032457
contains	set
for example on this site the isp provider field sometimes contains valuable information ie the named of the company even if the hostnamed isn t set

1032474
selected	checkbox
this will make an associativity arrays full over selected checkbox

1032488
autotools	gnu	build-system	autotools
the gnu build-system does not use .obj directory .so the autotools are not designed to support that

1032488
automake	gnu	build-system	automake
for an introduction to the gnu build-system i recommend reading the introduction of the automake manual

1032489
click	mouse
do they tell the video game a key was pressed or the mouse was click

1032498
click	mouse
a bots like you describe it will simply emulate key presses and mouse movements click .so the game cannot tell if a human is playing or another program

1032505
silverlight	wpf
i could be wrong - coming at this question as a wpf developer rather than a silverlight developer but in wpf you can create and insert controls into the xaml in code

1032515
arrays	loops
reading the file is fine but .when i try to loops through the streaming and load an arrays using the split function i get a expected end of statement error

1032516
copy-constructor	temporary
here an implementation might use a temporary in which to construct x 2 before passing it to f using xâ s copy-constructor

1032516
copy-constructor	temporary
also a temporary might be used to hold the result-of f x 2 before copying it to b using xâ s copy-constructor

1032524
virtualization	vmware
the vmware packaging is for virtualization purpose not for distribution

1032524
licensing	platform
however since the clients have access to the platform we have to make sure that they just can t take the images and run them elsewhere or defeat the licensing policy

1032527
n-gram	words
words n-gram will generally be more useful for most text-analysis applications you mention with the possible exception-handling of language-detection where something like character trigram might give better results

1034754
firefox	opera
supported natively in firefox opera

1034771
preventdefault	dom-events
i m a bit unfamiliar with jquery but if it is passing straight dom-events without modifying it which i doubt it is since the author of jquery is rather against modifying existing object then i would suggest against using only preventdefault as it is not supported by all browsers

1034780
blueprint-css	compass-sass
i would like to apply blueprint-css and compass-sass to a ruby-on-rails project

1034781

1034841
python	php
but on files that generator content dynamically php python etc. the scripting needs to specify that information itself

defined	declare
the only alternative i see now is passing the assembly file through c-preprocessor and redefining all the declare symbols manually if win32 is defined but that s not very pretty either

1034872
jquery	.post
this would involve creating a webmethods to accept the ajax .post on the server side and instrumenting the client-side with jquery to send the request receive the response

1034881
specifications	w3c
jquery can only selected xhtml elements that exist in a string if they re normally allowed in a div in the w3c specifications

1034899
profiling	trace
get a sql profiling trace going whilst the applications hit your db and you should be able to quickly spot any problem areas which may need more optimising or even de-normalising in some cases

1034902
ruby	php
you can still use other ruby-based frameworks if you just like ruby but ruby-on-rails would not be the right choice - and i d probably recommend php since it does well at simple scripting

1034903
jquery	.post
.when a user click a button in the other page i want to .post a messages in a div of the opening page via jquery

there is more info on arrays s versus linked-list here

1035178
value	field
if you wanted to find the value of specifically named field the input in a form something like this would find them for you

1035179
cross-compiling	cmake	cross-compiling	autotools	autotools	cmake
for cross-compiling i think your best choices are either cmake or autotools

1035179
cross-compiling	cmake
cmake handles this especially well as it lets you specify where the cross-compiling libs live

1035179
cross-compiling	toolchain
.so rather than searching for the cross-compiling .libpng in usr .lib it can be told to look in opt arm-eabi-gcc or wherever you have the toolchain .libs install on your building machine

1035179
cross-compiling	scons
scons is better but cross-compiling is not its strong points

1035179
autotools	cmake
it is not a building-system like cmake or autotools either it is only a building tool

1035179
cross-compiling	scons
cross-compiling support in scons is non-existent - you have to roll your own as discussed on this thread on the mailing list

1035179
cross-compiling	cmake	cross-compiling	autotools	autotools	cmake
cmake and autotools have the dependency problems figured out quite well and autotools cross-compiling support is mature

1035179
cross-compiling	cmake
cmake has had cross-compiling since versioning 2.6.0 which was release in april 2008

1035179
autotools	automake	build-system	automake	build-system	autotools
in the case of autotools it is slightly more complicated because not everybody who compiles the software would need automake and autoconf install only those that need to change the build-system adding new files count as changing the build-system

1035179
toolchain	cmake
cmake s approach is a little more heavywieght with the toolchain file but it means you don t have to specify all of you tools and libs cc cxx ranlib --with-ibfoo etc as they are figured out from a standards conventions

1035179
cross-compiling	cmake	cross-compiling	toolchain	toolchain	cmake
in theory you can reuse a suitably crafted cmake toolchain file in multiple-projects to cross-compiling them

1035197
numeric	digits
i have a max of 12 digits to play with and can be alpha numeric

1035198
priority-queue	queue	queue	fifo
normally a queue is in fifo order - request are process in the order they are received but they can also be order in other ways a priority-queue for example

1035264
put	get
i am using jquery to get data via ajax or from a client side data island and need to put this back into the grid

1035271
required	checked
i would also checked to see if they in fact always do have a value then you might be able to change to not null if the information is genuinely required by the busniess logic

1035284
revision	svn
i think this is likely to be a generics .net-assembly loading question but in my specific case i want my sharepoints features to points to an assembly whose versioning is associated with the correct svn revision numbers

1035308
http	ssl	spdy	ssl
updates i just read that google s spdy protocols designed to replace http looks like it will use ssl on every connection

it sounds like you d want to tunnel an existing lan protocols over a wan

1035309
packets	lan	traffic	packets
capture the traffic on the lan place said packets inside an udp packets and send it over the internet to the other side

1035309
packets	lan
.when receiving a packets get the data of the udp packets which is the ip packets from the other end send it out on the local lan

1035309
packets	lan
manipulate the ip addresses in the above packets to fit the local lan

1035309
packets	lan
write a device-driver that poses as network card that does the above points luring the os that it s sending out on the local lan but in reality the device-driver encapsulates the packets and send it to a reachable box on another lan

1035334
winpcap	libpcap
here is some winpcap libpcap tutorials

1035343
wait	hang
i think you can set it to 0 .so that it will never timeout but this not recommended as it means if the server hang or you lose the db connection your application will wait forever

1035354
hotmail	gmail
i ve noticed that gmail hotmail yahoo and ebay all have their login boxes on the right

1035373
entity-framework	nhibernate
orms -- nhibernate subsonic maybe entity-framework someday

1035385
sql-server	oracle
also in oracle an empty string 0 length is considered to be null therefore in some companies all strings columns are made nullable even on sql-server

1035385
sql-server	oracle
just because the first customer wants the software on sql-server does not mean the 2nd customer does not have a oracle dba that will not let sql-server onto there network

1035392
openoffice.org	uno
using the uno libs to automate openoffice.org from python open the html file in oowriter then save-as .doc

linux	unix
regardless of the language you are using you can use a product such as memcached linux unix memcached win32 windows velocity microsoft in which such product are used for caching farms

1035411
revision	svn
what you could do is keep the assemblyversioning the same at least whilst its a compatible major versioning but use the same technique to put the svn revision numbers into the assemblyfileversioning properties

1035457
required	checked
a key benefit to this approach is that the compiler will checked whether you ve implements all required methods in the protocols at compile-time which is generally what you want

1035487
display	width
i am using jquery accordion user-interface and if you look at the above page you can see it doesn t display the text correctly - the button are in odd places and the width of the text isn t spanning the white text block fully

1035487
display	height
i think this might have to do with the containers div having a static height set - but .when i try giving it a large height it still does not display properly

1035492
subproject	libs
depending on the size of the libs you may want to set it up as a distinct target in your project or for even more flexibility as a subproject of your main project

1035522
expression	brackets
bash required that brackets used to delimit conditional expression be set off with at least a single spaces from the expression

1035522
expression	evaluation	expression	brackets
i tend to prefer the expanded features offered with double brackets for expression evaluation

1035522
expression	evaluation	expression	brackets
the single brackets are evaluation an expression to a boolean

1035522
double	int
double parens are used for int math

1035556
build-process	nant
if .so then what i do is to hook up a clean database as part of my build-process using nant

1035556
.when	ready
this way .when i run my building my clean db is hooked up any updates scripting i have are ran against it to bring it up to speed then all my unit tests are ran against my code then my repository tests are ran to insure that my dal is working as expected then my db is rebuilt essentially reset to normals and then i am ready to go

1035558

the first part will upload the ftp file to the server and the second part will lo onto the telnet server and execute a program that can use the file you just upload by ftp

1035595
controllers	routes
.so whenever you want to specify .some kind of catchall route like the default routes that map every action in every controllers you need to do that at the end

1035608
continuous-integration	build-process	build-process	msbuild
you could search for automated build-process continuous-integration or msbuild if you want to set up a systemd that re-compiles and then publishes your site for you whenever you change the source code

1035623
internet-explorer	firefox
while this may break some existing sites it s a move made by both firefox 3 and internet-explorer 7 and results in improved security

1035624
any	set
with this arrangement you can have a team with any set of positioning

1035631
integration	payment
integration with payment api

1035642
asp.net-mvc	webforms
basically he was saying that asp.net-asp.net-mvc is not for large-scale enterprise .applications that it is not as flexible as webforms and that an asp.net-mvc .app will be slower than a webforms .app

1035642
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
and is asp.net-mvc better for large scale apps than asp.net webforms

1035643
value	field
it is up to the deployer to bind this context entry to a real value and to inject this value in the mybean field

1035657
fseek	ftell
i am running into integer-overflow using the standards ftell and fseek options inside of g++ but i guess i was mistaken because it seems that ftell64 and fseek64 are not available

1035657
fseek	lseek
i have been searching and many website seem to reference using lseek with the off64_t datatype but i have not found any examples referencing something equals to fseek

1035657
fseek	ftell
without any external libs what is the most straightforward methods for achieving a similar structure as with the fseek ftell pair

1035657
g++	gcc
my application right now works using the standards gcc g++ libs for 4.x

1035660
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think asp.net-mvc is a lighter framework and more performant because it doesn t do a lot of the things that the webforms framework does out of the box like viewstate for example

1035660
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i don t think it would be fair to say that asp.net-mvc is not for larger scale applications as it probably scale better than webforms would in terms of performance

1035692
application-pool	was
even though .when i create the iis7 website i told it to access the files as my user it wouldn t work at all otherwise for static file it was using the user of the application-pool

1035702
json	xml
use xml xsltransform json javascript jquery or whatever your favourite client-side transform is to rendering it

1035713
solaris	linux
for portability with other platform you should use getconf lfs_cflags which will return -d_file_offset_bits 64 on linux platform but might return something else on solaris

1035744
32-bit	64bit
just mmap the entire file - this required a 64bit os and is the most efficient and clear way to implements this however does not work on 32-bit os s

1035749
python	java
.when you reformat java it properly fixed the lengths of line both inside and outside of comments if the same algorithm were applied to python it would work

irrlicht	ogre
regarding the terrain feature ogre provides a much better terrain implementation than irrlicht in terms of flexibility performance and visual quality

1035854
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
performance - since both asp.net-mvc and webforms use the same asp.net as the core framework and asp.net-mvc is lighter and http compliant it gives you better performance

1035906
windows-server	windows
it s being used as the built-in scripting-language for exchange-server and sql-server and ships with windows 7 and windows-server 2008 r2

1035914
yacc	alex
it won t use lex yacc either because alex wants to learn how they re made

1035924
credentials	account
i suggest using an account table to hold your local account data that would then be related to an athenticationmethods table or a credentials table where you would hold related external authentication details

1035924
authentication	login
this allows your site and all of it s complexity to be related to account and your login process to nicely abstract the various forms of authentication that you might want to support

1035936

1035965
netbsd	linux
i d see if i could get linux or netbsd running on it

1035982
dump	temp
i need to run this proc and dump the results of table1 into a temp table

1036014

1036046
directory	folder
in linux can one set a custom icons for a folder directory as it appears in a desktop file-manager

1036046
gnome	kde
or perhaps using the desktop api for kde gnome etc.

finally you could also change you ajax request to return the data as json instead of the html contains the data and updates the value of the existing elements yourself

1036051
firefox	safari
once for the engine your hosted mode deploys on firefox linux safari mac ie6 win and one for your agile browser that lets you building css in real-time firefox + firebug

1036052
synchronous	nsoperation
since it is synchronous you might want to put it inside an nsoperation

1036056
gnome	kde
there is no standards way to do this across gnome kde and cde

1036067
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop looks for a null-pointer in the words arrays .so it knows .when to stop--but you don t have null in the arrays

contains	any
for example you might have a base-class that does xss validation of string properties verifying that they don t contains any html

1036072
double-quotes	single-quotes
there are at least 3 errors here the string uses double-quotes not single-quotes

1036073

1036076
strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy
if you want to assign to an arrays you have to explicit copy data into it with something such as strcpy not recommended except in selected cases due to potential buffering overflows strncpy memcpy or strncpy_s available only on windows

1036078
httpd.conf	.htaccess
if you are using apache the easiest thing to do is to enable the multiviews option in your httpd.conf file to enable it globally or in a .htaccess to enable it per-directory

1036090
python	lua
tinypy tinypy.org was made to be a small embed-able python subset written in the styles of lua

1036212
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
.so then i go try a slew of different browsers opera google-chrome and safari

1036227

1036248
value	field
you can also see instances field value

1036262
markup	xhtml
to write browsers compliant markup xhtml styles css and behavior javascript u need good amount of experience with lots of experiments and patience especially with ie

once you have a site looking perfect in opera move on to firefox ie7 8 google-chrome etc

1036288
any	set
in java you can t return a variables that may not be initializer just be sure in all possible flows the variables is set with any value

1036309
firefox	safari
i ve tested this in both safari 4 and firefox 3.5rc1 on both mac and windows-xp and 7

1036311
javascript	dom
basically javascript from one origin cannot interact with the dom of a document or windows from a different origin

1036339
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
i m using a javascript date selector within a html form and it s display as it should in the browsers i ve tested in firefox 3 opera 9 google-chrome ie7 but it display really large in ie6

1036380
32-bit	64bit
i m wondering if i can still develop 32-bit apps using a 64bit machine 64bit windows-vista with visual-studio 2008 sp1

1036398
32-bit	64bit
64bit vista will run 32-bit executable .so if you have a 32-bit compiler it will still work

1036402
32-bit	64bit
64bit windows runs 32-bit visual-studio just fine

1036402
command-line	cmd
cmd to create a command-line

1036407
json	xml
there are few if any established standards for dealing with cyclic references in the common non-binary serialization formats xml and json being the two most prevalent.

1036408
selected	textbox
therefore there is a question but will there be user-interface which added a selected box and textbox in html

1036408
selected	textbox
will it be a feeling to arrange a selected box and textbox

1036421
variables	boolean
i agree with the answers that state that you should initializer the isvalid boolean variables

1036424
mta	sta
is it possible to configure a rest wcf service to run as sta instead of mta

1036424
mta	sta
inorder to configure asmx web-services to run as sta instead of mta there is a workaround available that uses an httphandler to force the web service to run as sta

1036424
httphandler	httpcontext
applying the same httphandler to a rest-based wcf service using create new ado.net data service in visual-studio produces an error at the points at which the webservicehandlerfactory is called it s being passed the httpcontext url etc.

1036435
contains	any
also dictionary will not contains any callable unless you have attributes points to such callable but in that case isn t that part of object

1036447
imultivalueconverter	ivalueconverter
to get exactly what you are trying to do with the c# you wrote i would look at impmenting an ivalueconverter or imultivalueconverter

1036462
any	set
for any unicode character set operations performed using the _general_ci collation are faster than those for the _unicode_ci collation

1036464
launchd	daemons
apache commons has several components like daemons starting logging io application launchd db connection pools.

1036471
swing	swt
if you need to learn a gui framework then look at swing or eclipse swt

1036499
32-bit	64bit
64bit of consumer hardware is usually amd64 architecture which can run both 32-bit apps and 64bit ones natively

1036499
32-bit	64bit
windows-vista 64bit edition supports both 32-bit and 64bit systemd libs .so basically you can run both types of applications as well

1036526
virtual-keyboard	focus
i want to develop a systemd virtual-keyboard with swt technology on the platform of powerpc under ubuntu and what the problem i meet is that how to make the shell lose focus .when initializing the shell windows

1036539
value	field
i need to add an entry into a database everytime a field changes in a form indicating the old value and the new value

1036539
value	field
add a hidden-field for every field and compare it to the new value on submit then add an audit entry if neccessary

1036541
logout	login
well you can use default to hook scripting to login and logout .so that might be able to help with hooking shutdown reboot etc

1036558
value	field
let say i am done with custom field types .when i use this field in a list named temp and tries to create a list item it show me the available users for this site .when i create an item the data will be stored as string for selected user and .when i tries to view that list as a web part with filtering the user value as me

1036558
value	field
how can i store this string value as a spfielduser that normals people and grouping out of the box field types stores

1036567
put	get
how to write rules to get required out put

1036575
metaclass	getattr
in python there are many ways of making object behave slightly differently like metaclass and whatnot and it can overrides getattr and thereby have magical attributes you can t see through dictionary etc

1036598
ip-address	proxy
it might also mean that the first client1 address is faked and then the client connect through a proxy resulting in proxy1 being the client s ip-address and remote_addr being the single proxy used

1036600
maya	mel
in the menu for the scripting editor windows you can enable an option to display all the mel cmd that are execute as maya runs

1036600
maya	mel
then you can search in the maya installation s mel scripting for that function and see how the textures windows is created

1036617
value	field
this error messages occurs .when the value in the query s updates to row are field in .

1036622
solaris	linux
in addition compile with linux solaris

1036627
32-bit	16-bit
while different compilers indeed use different sizes it s usually 16-bit utf-16 or 32-bit utf-32

1036627
unicode	wstring
the situation in c++ is very similar std string - std wstring but there are at least effort to get some sort of unicode support in the standard-library

1036653
selected	button
whenever i click run main project button or click-right-mouse-button over a project and selected run i can see in tomcat s output windows all my other project are running as well

1036657
subtract	add
i want to add and subtract two dates as well as i want to subtract 1 year or 1 month from a particular date

1036663
viewmodel	caliburn
you can use caliburn s action feature to map events to methods on your viewmodel

1036689
buildpath	libs
.when i use eclipse i follow the instructions that daff gave where you edit the native libs under the jar in the libs tab in the buildpath

1036695
sql-server	oracle
you can use both sql-server and oracle

1036699
arrays	loops
the variant with 0-sized arrays is better because your caller doesn t need to checked for null and can process the arrays in a consistent way - say in a loops which would be empty in this case

1036738
perl	php
edit now that i know this is php-centric w is safe because php uses the pcre libs which is not exactly perl and in pcre w will not match unicode words characters

1036738
perl	php
it should work pretty much the same in php as it does in perl

1036740
verilog	vhdl
there is an online tool that can generator verilog or vhdl code for a pseudo-random numbers generator

1036757
pyside	pyqt
qtwebkit offers full access to a webkit browser which can be used in python thanks to language binding pyside or pyqt

1036758
beautifulsoup	elementtree
i suppose elementtree or beautifulsoup would be good starting points to interpreter the html structure

1036761
javascript	dom
depending on the specific javascript you might have to provide a good dom to the spidermonkey in addition to providing an xmlhttprequest implementation

1036764
unix-timestamp	julian
since the julian day is effectively the numbers of days and in some cases also the fractions of numbers of days since a certain date it is practically the same as a unix-timestamp presented differently

1036797
scala	java
.so it does seem that scala existential types and java wildcards are kind-of equivalent

1036806
javascript	dom
the bots should be able to work like normals browser automatically downloading relevant javascript files make xmlhttprequest run javascript operations modify dom except no gui will be needed

1036806
javascript	dom
it may sound a bit weird but i need a bots with capacity to operate like browser runs javascript modifies dom submit forms running on non-gui environment

1036819
any	set
right now every time i set up a new domain i copy all the files but i d really like to have these common files in one place .so any changes would affect all domains

1036823
binaries	install
no dependency on subversion binaries being install

1036831
any	set
however i do not want to hardcode a specific width rather let the largest checkbox set the width the above also fails if any width 75

1036850
revision	svn	revision	updates
it might work but be sure to be already authentication to your svn server and call another methods where you updates your revision before calling your dobackup methods

1036860
selected	button
i would suggest a button or a link that very clearly states that this action will selected all and with all i mean all recording across all pages

1036866
boolean	int
perl doesn t have a native boolean types but you can use comparison of int or strings inorder to get the same behavior

1036872
http	ssl
i am using http but ssl is not available due to shared-hostsing restrictions my server is a shared hosts environment

1036872
perl	php	pecl	pear
one of the reasons is that it is supported in php through various pear and pecl modules php is the language i intend to use for both my client scripting and my server scripting though perl is also available as a last resort

1036872
mime	rfc
i have come across rfc 1847 which defined encrypted and signed multipart mime messages

1036879
firefox	opera
tested on opera and firefox 3.0

1036899
contains	set
set the parent properties of all image components to the form that contains them

1036902
annotations	mapping
classb has a mapped class classc using plain old mapping annotations

1036902
order	add
how do i add an orderby annotations to classa s collections to classb .so that the collections is order by the named properties of classc

1036937
while-loop	arrays
this will create a 1000-element string arrays for each round in the while-loop

1036937
while-loop	arrays
this will create an identical character arrays for each round in the while-loop

1036937
arrays	loops
you can move that outside loops and just reuse the same arrays

1036968
pixels	line
for each grouping of samples mapped to a single pixels you could draw a vertical line segment from the minimum value in the sample grouping to the maximum value

1036980
required	checked
remember that the c++ runtime al.so provide portable abstractions for many things .so be sure to checked those first especially if a minimum overhead is required -- it might be simply easier to use c runtime functions than boost-filesystem

1036984
associations	model
the resources are not nested and almost everything i find on multiple model is for nested resources and nothing seems to apply to polymorphism associations

1036990
attributes	properties
something as simple as being able to associate a friendly named with a properties via an attributes is a huge win for user-interface code

1036990
reflection	runtime
.net reflection also provides a mechanism to create types etc at runtime which is hugely powerful for some specific scenarios

1036996
archive	backup
zip a whole set of folder to an archive as an automatic backup

1037000
ip-address	hostname
you can checked to see if a hostname exists and if dns can resolve an ip-address for it but this won t tell you if it s online

1037000
packets	ping
generally the lowest common denominator for hosts is the icmp packets - aka ping

1037009
authentication	login	kerberos	ldap
i m using gssapi in java inorder to login to an ldap server using kerberos authentication

1037013
32-bit	x86
building your solution against x86 will force your service to run as 32-bit

1037023
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
as far as i know asp.net-mvc leverages a lot of the features of asp.net webforms one of these service is how to get the html response from the templates .aspx file the view

1037024
database-table	mysql
database-table with text mysql is preferred for internal reasons pb with db purge as delete can be very long

1037024
mongodb	couchdb
document based db ã la couchdb or mongodb problem could be with indexing maturity speed of ingestion

1037042
32-bit	64bit
the problem is that the server process is 64bit and the libs is 32-bit and it tries to create the com component in the same process in-proc server

1037076
conditional	operators
i avoid nesting ternary operators or checked more than one conditional with them as that makes the code obscure really fast

1037080
swing	swt
what criterion should i use to choose between swt and swing

1037094
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
in almost 99 of normals usage those work in firefox should work in safari opera etc

1037130
swing	swt
it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing

1037134
reflection	runtime
.when reflection was added to c++ known as runtime types identification or rtti it was hotly debated

1037135
groovy	scala
dynamic-languages are on the rise and there are plenty of them ruby groovy jython scala static but has the look-and-feel of a dynamic-languages etc etc

1037143
mechanize	lxml	beautifulsoup	mechanize	beautifulsoup	lxml
mechanize may be overkill maybe you just want to find specific parts of the html and then lxml and beautifulsoup both work well

1037144
scala	java	python	ruby	python	java	ironpython	ironruby
learning ruby or python and scala to a lesser extent means you ll have very transferrable skills - you could use the java versioning the native versioning or the .net versioning ironruby ironpython

1037159
reserved-words	keyword
if you clean up your code -- renamed your column correlation named out it s a reserved-words change your keyword to uppercase etc -- then according to the mimer sql-92 validation your sql is valid intermediate sql-92 code

1037162
python	lua
in the game industry lua if you re an adobe based designer lua is also good if you re an embedded programmer lua is practically the only light-weight solution but if you are looking into web development and general tool scripting python would be more practical

1037164
udp	tcp
i am looking for the reason why fragmentation is done at ip level but why not for tcp udp

1037164
udp	tcp
pathmtu happens here why fragmentation is implements ip level is my question and why not implements tcp udp level code

1037179
hyperlink	external
i am using an javascript and ajax to dynamically load a php page into a div .when a hyperlink is click the div gets code from an external file loaded into it without the page refrshing

1037186
groovy	scala
my entirely subjective view is that scala seems to be getting a lot of the attention that groovy got a year or two ago

1037187
udp	tcp
tcp udp are transport protocols and they shouldn t care of fragmentation - it s not their problem

1037191
python	ruby
now if you want to go all the way dynamic both ruby or python are awesome languages

1037194
directory	folder
windows controls directory icons by use of a hidden systemd dekstop.ini file in each folder

1037207
environment	building
mingw cross-compiling for linux building environment

1037209
value	field
i just want to express that the field are separated from value by a but antlr seems to eat all characters at once because the identifier looks a lot like a value

1037219
cartesian-coordinates	points
i want to read cartesian-coordinates of a large set of points from of a .txt file into a matrix or some such data structure using a c program

1037226
buffering	streaming
does anybody have a good analogy or failing that a good resource for describing the relationships between buffering streaming readers channels selectors etc

1037228
linux	unix
have a look at the book python for unix and linux systemd administration

1037237
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
simply said it s all about having mysql behave more like other tradional rdms like sql-server db2 or oracle

1037267
scala	java
it has access to all java libs of course just like scala

1037271
textbox	button
the problem now is however that a user stays in the last field takes the mouse and presses the ok button of another form without leaving the textbox first

1037305
value	field
does it not work to do an onblur .so both .when the user move to the next field or click .something else the value is saved

1037307
authentication	login
in the end we chose anonymous login with sasl authentication in ejabberd - it allows anonymous login and dynamic account creation and i believe the account do not stay on the systemd they are alive only whilst the connection is open however from what i remember the server will generator a random id for the user

1037312
perl	c++
basically just give me a class written in java or c# or even c++ and write the same in perl

1037312
protected	public
also extra points for showing how to do private protected and public class-variables properly

1037317
any	set
now i m getting error 1067 in the custominputbox.as file it s a dutch error unfortunately any way to set flex errors to english

1037344
show	next
figure 2.4 on the next page show an

1037391
exception-handling	error-handling
i don t think it will be possible to combine both the exception-handling logging and error-handling into one attributes or class without it becoming very tedious and complex or affecting the use of handleerror

1037396
webserver	upload	firefox	opera
.when i upload a jar file to my webserver people using firefox or opera don t have any problems downloading it

1037399
instrumentation	debugging
well if it gets really bad you can building your own private copy with debugging instrumentation

1037441
value	field
most likely those field value are set from viewstate or the server is overrides the value

1037448
radio-button	textbox
swing can handle a significant numbers of components with only memory limitations particularly using simple components textbox labels radio-button etc

1037462
boolean	int
i have string which might be int datetime boolean byte etc

1037473
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
solving your problem is very straightforward in a scripting-language like perl python or ruby

1037507
scons	cmake
as a result if you use ant to building your c c++-code your much more on your own that if you use a systemd with larger user base cmake or scons

1037507
build-system	cmake
personally i ve been very happy with cmake primarily because it is the only build-system which can generator real visual-studio project

1037507
scons	cmake
scons can too but they only make an external call to scons whileas cmake generator project which use visual-studio s own building engine

1037507
cross-compiling	cmake
i m not sure i d call cmake s support for cross-compiling mature since it still pretty young

1037508
selected	cell
touching the table view scrolling selected a cell anything that will force a redraw will make it reappear

1037510
firefox	safari
indeed firebug in firefox show the computed styles for this elements as having 0px for marginleft and marginright but this is non-zero in safari

1037514
swing	swt
my criterion to choose between swt and swing

1037514
swing	swt
notice i have only commercial experience with swt on small project and my swing experience is .so small that can t be taken seriously - my knowledge is rather theoretical than practical

1037514
swing	swt	eclipse-rcp	swt
briefly after my swt eclipse-rcp experience - on next project i would choose swing

1037514
swing	swt	look-and-feel	swt
it api seems for me easier than swt you haven t got to manage disposing components by hand to prevent memory-leaks you adding component to panels instead of constructing components with parent panels information former is closer to my previous experience...etc. native look-and-feel you can get in swing too overall performance is enough good swt should be faster because it s using native components of backed os - but is the performance gain really big pro

1037514
swing	swt
and there is lot of more custom components in swing than in swt this is very big pro for swing

1037531
radio-button	selected
the radio-button shall be selected if this properties has a specific value

1037544
.net	wcf
i d say the .net 2.0 and 3.0 would be the same from the latter but since .net 2.0 fmk does not have wcf i d suggest a windows remoting endpoint for the earlier if you re using .net 2.0 only or wcf as i stated

1037560
contains	any
you just need to say webpages.any this will return true if any menus contains a webpage with your specified role

1037564
exception-handling	error-handling
error-handling is done by checked the result-of com call and throw the appropriate _com_error exception-handling as necessary .so this implies you need to write exception-handling safely

1037620
authentication	logout
i am new in asp.net my problem is facing logout problem in myappication using master page and windows authentication

1037620
logout	login
note i am using login and logout in master page top itself...so if i checked the session for null redirect to home page which is also a content page then i am not getting the home page it self to login because infinite looping occurs.

1037642
shell	bash
i tend to use either shell usually bash or perl depending on the task

1037645
combinations	permutation
.when reading from a file or waiting for a connection to be established other human integration as well anything for what the numbers of iterator is not known a priori numbers of recording returned by an sql query or .when you do step of different size read 1 or 5 line from the file depending on the last one read .when going over all combinations permutation of object .whenever for-loop conditional become cumbersome

1037655
callback	methods
all animation methods slidetoggle slidedown accept a callback as an arguments which is called .when the effect they perform is completed

1037659
any	set
i d like to find files in clearcase that are labelsed with a specific labels but that do not have any other labelss set

1037667
google-chrome	safari
i don t know why there is such a big difference between safari google-chrome ff2 and ff3

1037671
csv	xml
maybe later before giving the csv data to excel parsing it by looking up the meaning of some value in an xml file

1037672
coalesce	isnull
isnull nullable value_if_null for mssql coalesce nullable1 nullable2 ... value_if_null for mysql

1037673
pygtk	pyqt	gnome	kde
theoretically it s possible to create pure python gui libs that will use ctypes on windows windll.user32.createwindowex etc native pyobjc on macos and pygtk pyqt on gnome kde

1037675
python	perl
python for me at the moment i like using python because it has an interactive terminal that i can use to building up and execute the scripting as i go along - but i used perl in the past

1037695
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1037744
cout	cin
in the overload function i use is.get to read those charaters one by one but program jump out the circle .when cin finish that means cout will not run

1037754
facebook	linkedin
does anyone know of an api that will allow for posting status updates to twitter linkedin and facebook

1037759
required	checked
now this is the simple controllers which required the user to be logged in checked the userid and send the appropriate file back to the user

1037762
constructor	object
to get your caching object call httpruntime.caching rather than creating an instances via the constructor

1037774
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works fine with google-chrome but firefox is finding errors

1037774
google-chrome	firefox
i am getting it to work fine in google-chrome but in firefox i cannot click the button

hash	md5
i have a wav file and i need to calculate the md5 hash of its contents

1037788

coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

1037789
account	api
they also have an api developer.namecheap.com which is free to use - although you have to either have 200 or greater in your account have spent 200 in the last two years or have 20 domains in your account

1037791
hash	md5
just look for digest md5 for the hashing part and any wav-related module if you want to hash a specific part of the file skipping metadata for example

1037838
show	next
what we want to do is .when user a opens the recordinging user b s list of recordinging is updates to show a lock icons next to the row to indicate the recording is in use

1037838
.when	ready
the messagess table is watched by a service client using the sqldependancy object .so that .when a new messages is ready the service building the relevant messages and send it to the desired client via jabber and the openfire server

1037849
google-chrome	firefox
i have a div elements that is appearing fine in google-chrome but firefox for some reason has decided to put a border around it

1037877
unmanaged	c++-cli
c++-cli provides a nice bridge between the two and lets you easily split different parts of the systemd between the managed and unmanaged worlds

1037894
authentication	login
in a web application intended for human not machine consumption i prefer to either redirect to login if the user is not authentication and rendering an error page if the user is authentication but not authentication

1037909
daemons	systemd
it also should be emphaised that on unix systemd daemons mode of mod_wsgi must be used and you must implements the code monitor describe in the documentation

1037991
postgresql	mysql
i ve been a mysql user never tried postgresql

1037994
instanceof	typeof
other useful operators in this category are typeof which returns a string representation of a primitive instanceof similar to is but disregards interface compatibility and as

1037995
output	mode
i m not sure if this would work but can you get more information by running directx in debugging mode and looking at the output

1038021

have you tried setting allowtransparency true on the iframe and setting the background-color of the document body of the child frame to transparency

1038102
data-annotations	xval
step 3 i use xval with data-annotations

1038139
constructor	private	instances	private
to add to the kevin s answer your constructor for your class resources should really be made private for it to be a true singleton otherwise nothing is stopping someone from creating a new instances of the resources class through the constructor

1038144
attributes	properties
xmlserializer is also really nasty sometimes i hate adding the myfieldspecified properties to create optional attributes

1038145
factors	matrix
generator standards normals independent deviates and then transform by multiplying by the cholesky factors of the covariance matrix

1038145
any	set
but any small sample set will not necessarily have the desired parameters in the desired ranges

1038157
hide	next
on error resume next is the devil incarnate and to be avoided as it silently hide errors

1038173
revision	svn
you can access the current svn versioning of the file choose downloading of the head revision

1038181
textarea	textbox
edited above to look for a textarea not a textbox

1038266
any	set
i have never set anything like this up before and want to know if there is any information i should consider or if anyone knows of a good place that explains how to do this well

1038279
postgresql	mysql
while it s unlikely that you ll find a significant benefit in postgresql over mysql if can t hurt to test

1038307
hash	md5
i was reading this question on md5 hash value and the accepted answer confuses me

1038307
hash	md5
yet the consensus answer to the question why aren t md5 hash value reversible

1038342
implements	extends
you can t extends multiple classes but you can implements multiple interfaces

1038350
filtering	grouping
use linq specifically groupingby then filtering by grouping count and return a flattened selectmany list

1038358
compact-framework	.net
i belive this is the same as in the .net compact-framework

1038360
triggers	insert
however i don t want to manually write a triggers for every table .so i m looking to automatically log the field named and data for each insert delete

1038361
base-class	inherited
perhaps you can mark the base-class properties with a common mapping than you only overrides the properties in inherited classes where it should be different

1038408
python	perl	python	java
java perl python to hook onto webkit gecko to solve the above rendering problem

1038413
hash	md5
1 the primary purpose of a hash is to map a very very large spaces to a smaller but still very large spaces md5 which will take anything and convert it into a spaces of size 2 128 -- big but not nearly as big as aleph-0.

1038413
spaces	output
imagine the idiotic hash-function sum which just adds all the digits of the input numbers it succeeds in mapping down but there are a bunch of collision input with the same output like 3 and 12 and 21 at the low end of the output spaces and the upper end of the spaces is nearly empty

1038413
hash	md5	spaces	output
.so a good hash that makes even use of the destination spaces will make it difficult to find two input with the same output just by the odds if md5 were perfect the odds that two input would have the same output would be 2 -128

1038413
spaces	output
that s pretty decent odds the best you can do without resorting to a larger output spaces

1038413
spaces	output
2 yes hash always cause data loss except in the case where your output spaces is the same as or larger than your input spaces -- and in that case you probably didn t need to hash

1038413
append	input
salt is just a set of additional information that you append or prepend to your input

1038417
hash	md5
yet the consensus answer to the question why aren t md5 hash value reversible

1038422
multiplication	exponent
powers are easy - just repeated squaring and multiplication based on the binary representation of the exponent

1038437
hash	md5
why aren t md5 hash value reversible

1038461
value	field
instead if you are not interested in a field value you just selected a null instead and parsing it on the client

1038462
any	set
is there any compression level to be set by me .so that the can be decompression by the symbian guy

1038466
http-request	httpresponse
but telling me that i can reconstruct it from the http-request httpresponse object is not useful

1038487
debugging	trace
or if you are debugging simply use a trace statement

1038491
single-sign-on	credentials
single-sign-on is just the idea that you have one set of user credentials that all website or intranet sites within the sso grouping accept to log you in

1038491
authentication	login
but in its most simple-form you might try building a set of web-services that interface with your authentication data and report back login success failure to the application consuming the service

1038500
web.py	django	turbogears	django	turbogears	web.py
a web framework like turbogears django grok repoze.bfg web.py or such

1038527
administration	account
as a rules of thumb only the farm service account that is the account under which owstimer.exe execute or account that explicit have the rights required to carry out such an operation on the configuration database typically administration will succeed

1038527
administration	activation	administration	account	activation	account
because those features are normally activated by administration from either the command-line assuming the admin also has rights in the farm configuration database or from within central administration where activation occurs through the farm service account -- guaranteed to have rights to the configuration database

1038533
object-oriented-database	db4o
you could look at the option of storing the audit in a separate database perhaps an object-oriented-database like db4o

1038541
constructor	object
there is one other option for cases where you want object to be a member of a specific class and not a descendant class you can use the constructor properties of the object and use a switching statement

1038566
vb.net	vb6
vb6 and vb.net are totally different languages and ms has never officially endorsed an automatic migration route for anything beyond simple applications

1038567
python	java	postgresql	mysql
i ve got a potential client who wants a database driven .app either in java or python driving mysql or postgresql but we need to get input from an external machine such that every time this external machine closes a microswitch a value in the database gets decrement and it show up on the .app

1038584
value	field
the above code does not work its not clearing the session value in the field

1038586
numeric	zero
the third is not strictly necessary as a literals zero is the same as the standards numeric format output for zero

1038587
double	int
there is no automatic conversion between int and double elements in the arrays with arrayscopy

1038591
double	int
that s exactly the case here - int and double are different primitive-types .so the exception-handling is throw as documented

1038606
selected	cell
which will selected the third row in myrange cell b4 h4 in sheet1

1038617
administration	enterprise
administration grouping membership domain local enterprise is one thing

1038618
value	field
on your confirmation page you can put a form with hidden field that contains all value and a back submit button which will .post them to the previous page

1038619
basic	vb6	versioning	upgrade
the vb6 upgrade wizard in visual-studio is actually a cut down versioning of artinsoft s visual basic upgrade companion

1038630
internet-explorer	opera
by default internet-explorer and some other browsers too like opera or maxthon for instances printing a webpage without any background images or colors

1038633
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
it works in ie6 firefox 1.0 and 1.5 and opera 8.5 - don t know about safari but i expect no problems

1038652
filtering	sorting
if you want sorting filtering etc.

1038658
subclassing	inherited
meaning if you subclassing the control .when you add it to the designer any changes you make in the constructor of your inherited control will show up in the designer

1038697
subtract	time
the mouseup event will subtract the start time from the current time

1038707
google-chrome	firefox
recently added ssl support -- google-chrome firefox and ie all like it and load pages just fine

1038707
32-bit	64bit
note .when ie 8 is mentioned it s 32-bit ie 8 on 64bit vista although the 64bit ie 8 has the same behavior

1038708
boost	stl
please only stl no boost or tr1

1038711
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem
i m creating some graphic data display widget in qt4 and i was tempted to use the qgraphicsscene for it create qgraphicsitem s for the data items etc

1038711
widget	button
google-maps that is the data would be display all over the widget and the button would be show atop of them to the widget

1038721
groovy	java
i found groovy to be a relatively easy jump from an extensive java background -- it s sort of a more convenient versioning of java

1038732
32-bit	64bit
are you running the 32-bit or 64bit versioning of ie on vista 64

1038732
32-bit	64bit
most time the 32-bit versioning is used since not many plugins support 64bit yet

1038732
32-bit	64bit
if it works in ie 8 32-bit on vista 64 then it could be an issue with the 64bit versioning of the browser helpers object bho

1038742
webforms	asp.net
i tried to put another web-config in a specific view folder views picture ... like it works in classic webforms asp.net but this doesn t seem to do the trick either.

1038766
value	field
since the field default-value is current_timestamp and it auto-updatess on updates you never have to explicit set its value

1038782
contains	any
i don t know of a way off the top of my head to have a smart pointers types that prevents the ability to delete the contains pointers and prevent copying the pointers into another smart pointers that takes ownership since the source doesn t have any ownership to give away but that might be an interesting class to represent that policy

1038786
contains	any
by adding an undefined-symbols to main he just means create any random external symbols to force the linker into searching your external libs that contains the test code

1038821
selected	checkbox
selected the unique recording only checkbox and then click ok

1038821
selected	button
make sure the filtering list is still selected and then click copy copy button

1038821
selection	highlight
the filtering list is highlight with bounding outline and the selection appears as an item at the top of the clipboard

1038836
integration	payment
we need php and mysql integration and payment support for main credit cards

1038843
contains	elements
if i access which has a linq error sequences contains no elements then i am show my nice generics error view from shared error.aspx but if i try to access which is a 404 then i get the usual asp.net

1038862
windows-xp	windows
i m moving the website from a virtual-machine that runs windows 2000 to one that runs windows-xp and i m not able to access the databases

1038863
pyflakes	pylint
is it or can it be supported by pyflakes pylint or similar tools

1038866
checkbox	button	selected	checkbox	selected	button
for example if i have selected few row through checkbox column and click on button to get all selected row id

1038867
html-input	onblur
onblur is not going to cut it as this isn t a standards html-input elements

1038867
contains	elements
i m not 100 sure if this is necessary but often because the event propagates to the elements which contains your list items

1038927
hash	md5
hash algorithms like md5 are cpu intensive

1038938
sql-server	oracle
here an interesting read on a presumed but not existing difference between mapreduce and an rdbms like oracle and sql-server

1038943
trojan	virus
maybe they have a virus or trojan causing the issue

1038990
nsinteger	int
i have tried using nsinteger and int but neither work

1038996
nsinteger	int
you cannot retain an int or a nsinteger as they are primitive-types - not object

1039018
dbvisualizer	toad
toad or dbvisualizer are examples for tools which could make you happier than sqldeveloper

1039027
base-class	inherited
both controllers are the same - they inherited the same base-class have the same attributes applied to them etc

1039048
communication	messages
.so far to handle the network communication i ve followed the advice from the yeahtrivia game on coding4fun game i use a dualhttpbinding and have use a callbackcontract interface to send back messages to clients

1039048
registration	login	callback	methods
it has methods callback to handle the game itself but also the chat systemd the login registration process the matchmaking the roster player info etc

1039052
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
it worked well at the end but i had to use two different versioninging of maven-assembly-plugin and maven-jar-plugin in the same pom got two profiling because what worked in one versioning was broken in another

1039054
linux	unix
on linux unix operating systemd there are few ways to do .so and usually i just write my program scripting normally and then add it to crontab or .something similar like launchd on os x

1039114
right-align	margins
for the site i used this on i removed the right-hand margins to use them for right-align headings and .so on

1039130
required	checked
i have a test that required me to uses authentication to checked to see if a user has logged in and authentication before performing its task

1039148
webserver	upload
basically how does a file upload from a webpage file input box to a webserver hosting a .net site for example with a fileupload control s upload event

1039154
.when	ready
the threaded tasks will get one manualresetevent object each and call the set methods .when they are ready

1039164
shell	bash
anything more complicated say something that parsing the output of a cmd and acts upon it becomes a pythoncript - i find it just as quick to write mainly because shell scriptinging are difficult to debugging bash scripting error messages aren t exactly useful compared to python tracebacks.. and the end code becomes much more readable

1039181
key-value	key
the latter is just a bunch of key and value and can be parsing the same way whether for get or .post whereas the former required full mime support and is thus more useful .when you have data that can t simply be represented as key-value pairs

1039186
versioning	upgrade
the directions i ve seen many applications take is at start checked an xml file that you hosts for information on newer versioninging and typically display a messages to the user preferably in a news ticker or non-obstructive manor about a new versioning being release and why they should upgrade

1039190
configuration	installation
the key requser-interfacerement is rapid iterator of the user-interface reusable front-end code and simplified deployment without any installation or configuration

1039192
getter	setter
show how getter setter private field alleviate the problem maybe move to a typed language if you ve been using json .

1039218
solaris	aix	solaris	unix	unix	aix
often production unix systemd solaris hp-ux aix etc. have a very plain vanilla install

1039218
python	perl
quite often they will not have perl or python install

1039218
python	perl
however it rapidly becomes a write-only language at fairly trivial levels of complexity .so perl or python might be a better choice if you are programming .something with a lot of internal process

1039218
python	perl
for something that involves parsing multiple log files formatting the output to a summary status file and sending you an email notification if it notices certain types of events you might be better off with perl or python

1039220
64bit	x86
i am guessing you are running the x86 versioning of dependency walker which .when analyzing a 64bit dll will show that it depends upon several x86 systemd libs

1039237
instances	self
that is a instances methods and self refers to that instances.

1039251
base-class	inherited
in any oop book you find that a square is a kind of rectangle and .so a square is represented as inherited by a rectangle but we know that this approach is deeply flawed i read a paper on that don t remember where but you can search about the fragile base-class problem in google

1039261
shell	bash
if you want to quickly checked if a module is install at least on unix systemd with bash as shell add this to your .bashrc file

1039266
shell	bash
well because bourne shell sh and not necessarily bash is pretty much available in any + n x installation

1039266
telnet	ssh
a good cmd of sh and vi its extremely helpful .when connecting to remote servers via telnet ssh

1039266
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
for local admin .when you own the server you can use python perl ruby and customize them at your will

1039276
perl	c++
compare this to c++ or perl in which i get frustrated over pointers and sigils

1039282
.net	wcf
first to setup the basis i will use c# .net 3.5 and i want to explicit use raw-sockets aio threads no wcf at first as i do want to fine tune the server and clients to my needs

1039297
administration	account
the problem is that i get always an error-code i am using administration account

1039308
attributes	properties
anyway i m using attributes on each properties in the base-class to map them to the returning dataset s columns

1039320
command-line	cmd
pypgp has a much simpler approach -- that s why it s a single simple python scripting basically it does nothing more than shell out to command-line pgp cmd

1039324
authentication	login	registration	login
also you could possibly isolate certain operations like the registration and or login process into simpler service - not knowing anything about your game i think this could well be a simple non-duplex service that provides a valid player token as its output which can then be used by the other service to authentication the player

1039328
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
as mentioned previously there are many prototyping tools which have a bit of a learning curve but an alternative to consider would be using a framework such as cakephp or ruby-on-rails which make for fast application logic and leave customizing the front end being the primary hard work left

1039361
contains	any
in terms of testing we have a base test class that any test class which contains tests that touch the database inherited from

1039400
while-loop	loops
as an example using a while-loop and possibly break ing .when we have something that meets our criterion then using the random numbers after loops

1039408
value	field
this could be in the form of encrypted value in hidden field depending on your security scenario

1039429
pointers	stack
i use raw pointerss for non-owning variables and the owner is usually wrapped into some kind of smart pointers such as boost scoped_ptr or even not a pointers at all but an object created on stack

1039440
logout	login
i have a user class with functions to login and logout and getdata

1039440
logout	login
it provides the functionality to use the user class you can login logout here

1039455
python	c++
eve online is probably the best example we have of python being usable but which uses a fork of the main python language many c++ components for performance and even that is for a fairly undemanding game in modern terms.

1039456
google-earth	google-maps
i m looking to embed a mapping a mapping control very much like google-maps or virtual earth into an application that in most cases will not have access to the internet meaning that i can t use the aforementioned apis or google-earth

1039470
checkbox	textbox
for example 1000 textbox 1000 dropdownlistfor and 1000 checkbox

1039470
click	mouse
i d like to save an ability to use templates databinding and simple event handling like mouse click

1039477
artifactory	nexus
i ve used both nexus and artifactory

1039497
jquery	.post
i m using jquery to .post to an asp.net web service to implements a custom autocomplete function

1039508
value	field
checked that the field have valid value filtering input

1039521
datagrid	listbox
this is what listbox datagrid and other tabular list format controls were designed for

1039579
keyvaluepair	key
then instead of storing a single keyvaluepair you could lookup the list of them via the key in the first elements

1039594
eager-loading	eager
i understand that eager-loading solves my issue in this particular case but in my application i don t want to have to eager load everything

1039607
any	set
you might find that it will work if you building a console application and set the target cpu in the visual-studio configuration manager to x86 instead of any cpu

1039607
32-bit	64bit
this will force your application to run in 32-bit mode on the 64bit server

1039666
any	set
are there any flags that you can set for the dojo.tojson methods that will allow you to control the level of input string manipulation escaping

1039669
artifactory	nexus
here are some things off the top of my head that i really like about artifactory keep in mind nexus may have these features too

1039669
credentials	security
ease of integration with existing ldap servers for security i m a big fan of a single repository for storing credentials

1039694
attributes	properties
how can i use a jtable to display edit attributes properties for entities retrieved from an entity-attributes-value eav store a relational dbms

1039700
credentials	account
finally as a step in trying to narrow down where the problem might be you might want to run the asp.net process itself with admin or systemd credentials to see if something in the permissions of the account the asp.net instances is running under is part of the problem but please do this only for troubleshooting

1039714
display	width
but a path in svg can be display only with a certain width

1039715
triggers	insert
i would think you d have to do this via an insert triggers and transactional locking around the sequences increment

1039719
readfile	file-io
this mirrors the functionality of the read systemd call which file-io typically ends up calling win32 stuff may call readfile but i believe that the functionality is similar

1039753
operators	keyword
the vb team decided to create more language extensions than the c# team did in terms of keyword that translation to standards query operators

1039763
32-bit	x86
the install inno-setup always wants to install the application to the program files x86 folder in vista x64 which i m assuming is because the install itself is only 32-bit

1039766
value	field
if you add a column you could just fetch the key field and the value for the new column only

1039766
value	field
i would query the new field into a map of key to value and have my primary model contains a list of map of key to value

1039771
having	union
i would like to get rid of the union since i m having to search back over the entire table 2x

1039798
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
.when i run the site locally on my development machine everything works fine in firefox ie opera and safari all the latest versioning - i work from home and i only have 1 machine for personal use and development use except for some css difirefoxerence between them and .when i go to the live site on my machine it works fine also

1039801
cross-join	inner-join
is a cross-join - which you limit into an inner-join with the where clauses

1039809
contains	any
it contains any value posted from a html form to this scripting

1039815
specifications	w3c
see the w3c svg specifications for details but basically you should be able to do something like this

1039839
webinvoke	wcf-rest
basically what do i need to implements such wcf-rest concepts like webget webinvoke uritemplate etc

1039840
32-bit	64bit
as jeff mentions if you are compiling to any cpu managed-code this code can be run on 32-bit or 64bit frameworks

1039840
32-bit	64bit
reference advantages to compiling as 64bit and considerations of 32-bit vs

1039840
32-bit	64bit
i would not recommend putting 32-bit programs in the 64bit installation directory but this is simply for conventions

1039870
capacity	storage
does anyone know what subset of the iphone s overall storage capacity is reserved for applications and application data

1039872
shell	bash
are you by any chance writing code on a windows platform and trying to run it from a bash shell somewhere else

1039872
shell	bash
on the bash shell there will usually be a cmd called dos2unix if you find it try running

1039875
credentials	account
.so what i d like is for the user account control credentials prompt to appear and that way if the user has an admin account al.so they can put in the credentialss

1039875
administration	account
this is apparently how applications are supposed to be designed to keep the user from having to switching to another account each time they need to do something administration

1039875
selected	button
.when the application detection that one of these button has been selected it has the following two choices

1039876
interop	tlbimp
you need to create interop assembly using tlbimp tool

1039912
asp.net-mvc	webforms
just remember that asp.net-mvc does not use the server controls and code-behind that you are familiar with in webforms .so you won t be setting text properties in your code

1039919
margins	padding
they ve got tons of excellent tutorials with step-by-step explanations and everything about margins padding and browser compatibility issues

1039921
implements	extends
if the class implements some interface or extends an abstract-class you can tell jmockit to capture and mock implementation of the base types on demand as they are loaded by the jvm and even assign the created instances to a field in the test class

1039938
malloc	free
that means you have to use malloc prefer nsallocatecollectable on leopard or later and free to manage the memory

1039941
put	get
if the numbers of rows that get updates as opposed to insert every time you put up a new rowset it not too high then i think you should consider import the new set of data into a set of staging tables and do an update-where-exists and insert-where-not-exists upsert solution and just refresh your indexes ok ok indic

1039942
smalltalk	lisp
it can be done in smalltalk and in lisp

1039943
sqldatasource	datalist
i have a datalist that is bound to a sqldatasource

1039947
base-class	inherited
early in my learning about the little snags of this process i found that a numbers of the problems i would run into with tframe descendants streaming incorrectly often appearing as forms in the ide rather than frame could be completely eliminated by introducing my own tbaseframe class which inherited from tframe with no chanegs and then use that as the base-class to develop components from adding methods properties etc

1039947
put	get
i could put all of my frame based components into one giant package but i d really really prefer not to as i can clearly see that will get too large out of hand over time given the nature of how many sets i plan on developing

1039955
checkbox	textbox
if the database field in sql-server is of types bit then the the datagridview automatically maps it to the datagridview as a checkbox instead of a textbox

1039967
listitem	selected
asp listitem value selected one or more states- asp listitem

1039967
listitem	selected
asp listitem value selected one- asp listitem

1039976
webforms	asp.net
is it possible to take advantage of xval s automatic client side validation with asp.net webforms

1039976
asp.net-mvc	webforms
these controls would be the webforms equivalent of html.clientsidevalidation for asp.net-mvc

1039982
ssl-certificate	ssl
a new types of ssl called ev ssl is marketed to represent one of the highest levels of assurity and browser vendors are participating in presenting notification to users in a clear manner .when a site uses an ev ssl-certificate

1039988
children	nodes
using that set-up you can run a single query and retrieve all the children of a given nodes of your structure

1039999
search-engine	seo
if you care about seo and driving traffic to your site these are good ways to get better search-engine coverage today

1040003
return-type	arguments
the real problem is that very likely has a return-type of void .so you can t nest that expression as the arguments to the outer -addobject call

attributes	properties
the specifications says that css styles declare properties always take precedence before the ones declare in xml attributes

1040252
cursor	row
as an aside i feel speed is only useful after correctness and i m not convinced that the time saved by not having to move from the home row to the cursor key and back without looking at the keyboard is really that important .when compared with getting the actual code written correctly

1040259
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	safari	opera
as far as i know opera 9 and webkit safari google-chrome do it on pcs and rumour has it that ff3.5 will also be able

1040260
value	field
there are security implications in doing that because the login info would appear in the .source of the page as value for hidden form field .so perhaps that not the way you d like to go

1040263

1040307
svg	vml
it has a hell of a good api and does vml in ie that can t understand svg

1040313
value	field

1040320
abstract-factory	singleton
you could also use an abstract-factory with that singleton

1040355

arrays	loops	filtering	grouping
loops through it once and building an associativity arrays or hash of the data grouping as you want to filtering it

1040453
functional-programming	imperative
functional-programming instead may be extremely useful in a very pragmatic manner - many oo imperative languages have now include functional elements for this reason linq anonymous functions readonly value function-pointers delegation type-inference you can concentrate on what should be done which allows you to express more in less code that is even less error-prone

1040453
scala	java
non-purely functional languages standards functional languages like scala or f# can be integrated easily into existing java or .net-projects .so you can combine the benefits of both paradigms where they are needed

1040486
python	c++
in c++ like in python both semantics and syntax are implicit although in c++ and in python if you get the strong-typing preprocessor you do get some help from the compiler

1040486
python	c++	python	java
this is true in c++ python or java

1040486
spaces	output
for example in algorithms which take an input range and an output iterator chances are the output iterator needs enough spaces for a certain numbers of output based on the size of the input range and maybe the value therein

in firefox 3.0.11 and internet-explorer 8 i was showing pretty much identical pages

1040645
controllers	routes
since i don t really want to muck around with the existing controllers and routes i thought the best way to accomplish this would be to create a subdirectories in-app controllers called flex and put in some additional controllers in there to handle the flex specific request

1040645
controllers	routes
any thoughts on how to add this controllers to my routes file to handle the http verbs

1040650

as i edit this 8 july 2009 i recently learned that loquendo has voice recognition and speech-synthesis asr text-to-speech for the iphone

1040659
spring	seam
you can then selected which framework to use such as spring or seam and these integrated well with orms like hibernate

1040661
javascript	dom
since 95 of the people picking up javascript are doing .so just to manipulate the dom there s no points in going through the longer mootools learning curve

1040661
javascript	dom
they use a server-side language for the heavy-lifting and javascript for the dom

1040662
environment	building
with jsp s you can have your data object be plain java classes and eclipse offers both environment for building jsp s and features to facilitate connecting to databases and creating db classes

1040676
python	java
eclipse for both java and python with the pydev plugins is also a good option

1040679
authentication	impersonation
i d like to go back to the vendor and say there s no way you could need an lsa subauth package for impersonation - take it out but i m not sure i understand the use cases and possible limitations of the standards win32 authentication impersonation apis well enough to make that claim definitively

1040711
http	ssl
.so presuming that the signup page is now http under one certificate is there any rea.son at all that there should be a problem redirecting to worldpay which is under ssl but under a different certificate

1040731
arrays	loops
i can only come up with using tostring and splitting by and then loops through the arrays and parsing every single string

1040755
asp.net-mvc	webforms
really quick with wizards linq many patters asp.net-mvc webforms you choose

1040755
python	java
like eclipse + python or eclipse + java or eclipse + php.

1040756
any	set
you underestimate the ability of people if you think any set of rules can successfully force someone to perform better

1040770
any	set
this seems to work fine - until i try to set any properties on any nested control on one of these user-controls in the event handler of a button which throw a cross threading exception-handling

1040785
font-size	height
the line-height properties allows you to set the height of a line of text independently from the font-size works well for centering a single line of text vertically etc.

arguments types return-type - methods-signature such as i v with the additional pseudo-type of v for void methods

1040884
sql-server	ms-access
enter code here i have a table on sql-server 2005 with bigint primary key and ms-access 2003 front end linked-tables

1040888
hide	show
or you could triggers the click of the show hide binding and that way you wouldn t have to change the implementation of a#slick-toggle should you decide to change the animation

1040917
http	ssl
the answer to your sign up page is that you need to force http ideally from code-behind .so users can enter their account information with the ssl encryption and see that trusty lock icons

1040928
macros	vba
what i ve done where i need users to have vba enabled is to set all sheets to xlveryhidden on save except a custom locked sheet that only has a note saying macros must be enabled and a brief guide on how to do this

1040937
mouseover	mouseout
or use javascript mouseover mouseout

1040952
specifications	w3c
the w3c css 2.0 specifications for the hover selector doesn t mention anything about requiring an href attributes

1040975
firefox	safari
maybe the most complete package of the bunch and supports testing in ie firefox and safari

1040981
value	field
the applicationvalues have a key the form field phone-number and the value

1040991
temporary	rvalue
.when you assign an rvalue to a const reference you are guaranteed that the temporary won t be destroy until the reference is destroy

1040992
sql-server	ms-access
.so you have ms-access db which is a front end to sql-server

1041002
perl	ruby	perl	php	ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	python	perl
they are all excellent and significantly better than most of the options for python ruby perl php and c# looking from a cross platform perspective.

1041002
stripes	spring	tapestry	spring	tapestry	stripes
checkout any of the frameworks tapestry spring s web framework stripes struts...they can all do this kind of thing in the dark blindfolded hands tied in the rain with nails on the floor

1041003
aggregate-functions	sum
you may only reference non-aggregate value single-row value in an aggregate-functions or in the where-clause .so the .solution would involve placing your case inside an aggregate-functions in this case your sum

1041008
testcomplete	web-testing
there is a commercial tool called testcomplete that lets you do web-testing using vbscript

1041011

1041035
facebook	linkedin
what are some good gem that allow simple pre-built connect and integration with networks like twitter linkedin facebook etc

1041050
contains	any
the same will be true for any custom classes used - if the project contains their definitions is referenced by the client project before the service reference is added then wcf can re-use those definitions

1041061
constructor	private
just make your constructor protected or private .so you preserve the class invariants

1041061
constructor	private
private no-arg constructor for hibernate

1041083
subclassing	superclass
here you re doing the reverse - you re attempting to reference an instances of the supertype in a variables of the subtyping assuming decal is the superclass and transactiondecal the subclassing

1041092
bazaar	git
there are a few popular versioning git mercurial and bazaar

1041092
git-repo	repo
to apply this you would use your own local git-repo import different svn repo as local branches in that repo

1041113
any	set
applications can set a palette of any

1041119
contains	elements
since a p elements cannot contains another p elements you can imply with 100 reliability that starting a new paragraph will close the previous one

1041127
any	set
that way you can set the internal instances to be the generics decal without losing any transactional data

1041138
order	add
if you want to give your user full control over the order of entities you should add a new field for example

1041146
getter	setter
the linq-to-sql and other data sources model use a traditional object-model of add remove getter and setter and updates to commit the changeset to the data backing

1041152
any	set
applications can set a palette of any

1041194
pointers	stack
the weirdest thing is that initializer this same pointers types on the methods stack results in a correct object but subsequent call to __hook turn on an access violation .when trying to create a base com class

1041202
aiff	wav
in particular this libs support wav au aiff mp3 csl sd smp and nist sphere files

1041208
json	xml
response format application xml application json

1041214
protected-mode	real-mode
what i was doing wrong was believing the routines worked--all the routines that bombed were manipulating a real-mode pointers with a protected-mode pointers types

1041214
protected-mode	real-mode
unless the real-mode segment value happened to be valid in protected-mode this went boom

1041228
json	xml
you need to put application json in your accept header this tells the server you want it to respond in that format - not xml

1041235
constructor	object
this threadmanager object is passed to the threadpoolserver coonstructor .so pass a larger numbers to the constructor of this object to increase the size of your thread pool

1041253
perl	php
i m not sure about php regular expression but in perl the re would be simple

1041283
jface	swt
a jface viewer is a selection provider .so you can use it if you re using jface or you can implements the iselectionprovider interface .when you re using custom swt controls that was my case

1041285
jquery	.post
i want to know if .when i make a ..post ... with jquery is any cookies sent to the server in the .post request

1041316
value	field
my question is that there are some queries that return key that overlap and i actually want the final key field returned value to be distinct-value

1041320
union-all	union
use union instead of union-all

1041372
clisp	sbcl
common-lisp sbcl and clisp

1041372
clisp	sbcl
according to this sbcl and clisp support unicode

but we just can t find any option to set the page range to print.

1041397
value	field
this methods takes three parameter value from three field on the report

1041419
.when	ready
that place will checked collision and other conditional and .when it s ready to delete the object it will not have to ask if deletion is okay because it knows it s the only client and can safely dereference what it allocated

1041446
ado	jet
for jet 4.0 features it has to be ado classic

1041446
ado	jet
for jet 3.51 features and earlier pick either ado or dao

1041446
ado	jet
for one you will find more dao code examples than ado for access jet

1041446
ado	jet
edit just to clarify for jet 4.0 features it has to be ado classic this is because dao 3.6 only received a few enhancements for the features new to jet 4.0

1041475
entity-framework	nhibernate
if you want to be successfull in creating an application in a domain driven fashion using an o r mapper like nhibernate or the entity-framework it is still necessary that you - the developer - have a basic understanding and knowledge of how relational-model works

1041480
rollback	commit
the best way i can think of which mimics the jpa specifications is to create your own transactional annotations and use reflection to inject the begin commit rollback operations

1041492
contains	elements
if you can draw the image in a canvas elements then you can use the getimagedata methods to return an arrays contains rgba value

1041496
32-bit	64bit
- assuming you are running .app as a 32-bit .app the va spaces available for your process is only 2 gb 3gb if you enabled large address spaces switching .so even if you have huge page file it doesn t matter if you are 32-bit process it matters if you run 64bit where you have huge address spaces

1041513
multithreading	wait
there really seems to be only two ways out - either switching to nptl required kernel 2.6 or avoid such multithreading fork wait model this was my solution to the problem and tough it made the architecture a bit more complicated and complex it still was manageable to do in a single day

1041564
key-value-store	redis
more exotic options might be to use a key-value-store supporting counter instructions such as redis or a scalability olap database such as vertica

1041577
bitwise-operators	operators
the points i am trying to make is to emphasise that although the bitwise-operators are essentially endian neutral you cannot ignore the effect of endianess in your code especially .when combined with other operators

1041592
python	java
python can handle arbitrary sized numbers as can java with its biginteger

1041594

1041620
duplicates	elements
i need to take a c++ vector with potentially a lot of elements erase duplicates and sort it

1041624
order	add
if you install this add in it will allow you to inspect elementss and see exactly what css styles are being applied to the elements and in what order and edit them in real time

1041625
jquery	.post
if i do a .post from jquery like .so

1041626
duplicates	elements
std unique only works on consecutive runs of duplicates elements .so you d better .sort first

1041628
duplicates	elements
unique only removes consecutive duplicates elements which is necessary for it to run in linear time .so you should perform the .sort first

1041630
duplicates	elements
std unique only removes duplicates elements if they re neighbours you have to sort the vector first before it will work as you intend

1041632
rollback	commit
using the code below i got that all working fine except i don t know how where to commit rollback my transactional

1041633
shell	bash
large parts of the scripting were ported from other people s bash scriptinging .so that provided a nice stable feature scoping to crib off of - maybe taking a look at .some utility shell scriptinging would give you an idea to translation it into python thus making it a little more extensible and readable

1041649
windows-xp	windows
i found one page that suggested that you could create a sendto folder in c document and settings all users but the article was targeted at windows 2000 and it does not appear to work in windows-xp

1041652
itextsharp	itext
we re attempting to use itext actually itextsharp with c# to parsing the pdf populate the xfa field and then save the modified pdf back out

1041652
itextsharp	itext
all the examples i can find with itext very few itextsharp examples talk about modifying acroform field

1041665
32-bit	64bit
i need to ensure that it masks out half no matter if i am on a 64bit or 32-bit platform

1041666
recording	playing
all the apps which recording sound first disable any music playing

1041678
pointers	stack
your instructor probably is trying to get you to avoid 1 returning pointers to object on stack from functions which means that they won t exist after the function exit and 2 allocation object on the free store .when you don t have to

1041683
authentication	login
a good example a login page that call either a web service or ashx file to authentication

1041688
duplicates	elements
instead they are copy-paste to the end unique returns an iterator points to the first such duplicates elements and you are expected to call erase to actually remove the elementss

1041725
python	ruby	python	java
finally i think it is worthwhile to learn one strong languages like c# or java one functional language and one scripting-language like ruby or python

1041737
perl	php
this is especially true for languages like perl or php which both borrow a lot of idioms from earlier languages

1041746
configuration	logging
i had to also set the types option to debugging in the logging configuration

1041780
recording	playing
based on that discussion it seems entirely possible to both play and recording at the same time but i m sure you ll have to do your own filtering to avoid recordinging the sounds your playing

1041783
value	field
i have a problem only with bool value if i bind the same column to some other field just changing keypath all works fine

1041788
put	get
put a list of things that need to get done into a tracking systemd jira is you have the dough giving as much outline as is necessary to get each task done

1041814
easymock	jmockit
there are many mock libs that you can use such as easymock and jmockit

1041832
put	get
it will usually come out in the same order it was added but there are no guarantees and once you get a lot of rows in your table there s a reasonably high probability that they won t come out in the order you put them in

1041847
for-loop	arrays	explode	echo
i then explode it and put the ids named into an arrays and then use a for-loop to echo them out

1041874
bubble-sort	quicksort
specific ones bubble-sort can be much faster than quicksort depending on input characteristics

1041883
telnet	ftp
it does not matter whether you use wcf dcom ftp telnet or anything else to connect to windows-server

1041895
key-value	key
the initial insert statement will execute if there is no existing recording with the specified key-value either primary key or unique

1041897
arrays	loops
since i don t know exactly how many sets every user may choose to submit i pass the data to php in an arrays using a named followed by .so i can use a foreach loops and always get every dataset

1041899
hidden-field	checkbox
let say 1 control has a hidden-field and a bunch of checkbox

1041899
hidden-field	checkbox
.when a checkbox is checked it sets the hidden-field to yes

1041901
key-value	key
the initial insert statement will execute if there is no existing recording with the specified key-value either primary key or unique

1041903
console.writeline	console.readline
i use console console.readline and console.writeline for input and output

1041915
directory	folder
rather than constantly push to two different folder location i figured i can push to one location and have a virtual directory on each website points to the single folder on the webserver

1041920
postgresql	mysql
i do not know about mysql but i know that where i work we use a stored procedure on our postgresql databases to do this

1041923
any	set
of course your performance gains will totally depend on how long it takes you to process each set of recording but javaspaces won t cause any problems if distribute across several machines

1041927
initializer	setter
isn t it possible to keep the direct initializer of the field and also provide the setter

1041928
getter	setter
then set your delegation to be this new manager set your vertical field manager to be the middle field you ll probably want a designated setter your button field to the bottom field again designated getter

1041932
.net	wcf
i worry that biztalk is being taken over by the .net types within microsoft and may be headed in the directions of the closely-bound interfaces of wcf

1041935
digits	base
a104619 write the natural numbers in base 16 in a triangle with k digits in the k-th row as show below

1041955
enumerator	any
is there any way i can make datatable enumerator without using selected

1041968
variables	boolean
if that doesn t work try the detail sections onformat event but but in a report level boolean variables .so it only does it once

1041992
value	field
.when trying to save i get a null value exception-handling on the car.engine field .so obviously the default engine is not created and saved

1041995
r5rs	r6rs
works with r5rs at least should work in r6rs after import correct libs

1041998
constructor	object
in your example the private_method and its environment is shared across all object - since your public_method closure is created only the first time the object is construct and bound to the constructor s prototype properties that sets the created object s internal prototype-chain - .so the private_method that is used is only the one that was created the first time

1042010
sql-server	sqlcommand
the sql-in sqlconnection sqlcommand and generally anything in system.data.sqlclient refers strictly to sql-server

1042010
sql-server	ms-access
ms-access is definitely not sql-server

1042011
value	field
i have a recording with the value 6 24 2009 9 00 00 am to mydate field

1042017
highlight	cell
i have tons of data that i would like to highlight only those cell that fulfill some criterion said value 0.100

1042021
dictionary	arrays
you can create dictionary store value for each setting or an arrays and then dump it to plist

1042042
subclassing	base-class
this surprises me because i thought that if a constructor is not defined in the subclassing s that the base-class constructor methods specifically the one with the single int param would be invoked w o an error

1042047
textbox	button
.so far i have lots of text a few textbox and a button which will execute a javascript function after a numbers is entered into one of the textbox

1042047
textbox	button
however i noticed that after i add entries into my textbox and then press the button all of my entries erase

1042047
textbox	button
as a reiteration would anyone know why my textbox entries erase after a button s onclientclick event execute and how to stop this from happening

1042053
constructor	private	any	set	derived-class	base-class
also you wont be able to set any private base-class-members unless in your derived-class you explicit call the base-class constructor

1042059
constructor	object	subclassing	base-class
the rea.son is that a base-class s constructor will not know how to initializer the subclassing s members .so having them invoked would put the subclassing object in a bad state

1042063
subclassing	base-class
in which case you need to explicit call the appropriate base-class constructor from the subclassing s constructor

1042063
derived-class	base-class
it is calling the parameterless base-class constructor but sending an int since you are not explicit calling the base-class constructor that accepts an int from the derived-class constructor

1042069
parentheses	braces
delimitmate - automatic closing of parentheses braces

1042076
32-bit	x86
i don t know if you are familiar with x86 32-bit assembly

1042076
any	set
any x86 assembly code will run x86_64 machine since the instruction set has been design to be compatible

1042078
any	set
i m wondering if there are any .net libs ideally open-source that deal with guitar chords given either a chord or a set of fret string combinationss it can retrieve the corresponding fret string combinations or chord respectively

1042079
constructor	object	base-class	inherited
the reason for this is that all classes inherited from object class and a constructor must call its base-class constructor

1042094
parentheses	braces
to add more detail the syntax for defined a capture class called a tagged expression in the docs uses the braces not parentheses as you are using here

1042101
firefox	opera
this solution works well on firefox but the output of opera and ie6 is much different

1042101
show	next
on ie6 - the button are on the first row and content is show on next row with full length

1042109
dependency-properties	attached-properties
the static-methods only work with attached-properties not dependency-properties

1042110
cout	cin
in c++ using cin and cout is too slow

1042110
printf	scanf
use printf and scanf instead

1042120
comma-operator	operands
you are suffering from the comma-operator which evaluates and discards the value of its left-hand operands and then evaluates its right-hand operands as the value of the expression

1042120
default-value	arguments
also the default-value for the arguments to processevent is why your one-arguments call was acceptable

1042139
dsa	rsa
updates the pgp module does not provide ways to generator key but presumably these could be created with the low-level rsa dsa etc

1042139
command-line	cmd	m2crypto	openssl
also if you know how to generator these using openssl command-line cmd it should be reasonably easy to convert that to m2crypto call

1042161
jquery	dojo
...with prototype or dojo instead of jquery how would you do it

1042163
triggers	insert	contains	set
to that end a workable solution is often to add an entire new column which just contains the date portion of the given datetime column and use insert updates triggers to ensure it s set correctly

1042163
triggers	insert
the impact of the triggers on performance shouldn t matter since insert and updates happen far less than selected

1042169
distance	polygons
to answer your original question as to how to generator the smaller polygons you can find the centroid of each polygons and offset each vertex by a percentage of the distance to that centroid points of the polygons to get the smaller polygons

1042179
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.11 gecko 2009060215 firefox 3.0.11 .net clr 3.5.30729

1042179
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.11 gecko 2009060215 firefox 3.0.11 .net clr 3.5.30729

1042206
filtering	grouping
the having clause applies filtering to the results of the grouping by query

1042233
duplicates	contains	contains	any
table a contains 7160 recording and table b 7130 recording.now i want to insert distinct recording from table a into table b such that b should not have any duplicates entry in it

1042253
triggers	insert
is it possible to assume that the insert and deleted tables presented to you in a triggers are guaranteed to be in the same order

1042263
exception-handling	try-catch
try putting a try-catch in the methods that is being execute and see if you re getting an exception-handling

1042278
triggers	insert
you can do it in an insert triggers

1042294
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1042294
object-reference	instances

1042295
groovy	java
it has code-formatting i just need to tell my vim that groovy and java are similar..

1042297
binary-data	chunks
it is not really meant to store largish chunks of binary-data

1042304
dlopen	dlsym
this comes handy while using dlsym and dlopen for calling such functions

1042317
callback	methods
invoking the callback methods specified

1042321
base-class	inherited
typename is the base-class from which your master page is going to derive .so if you have defined your own basemaster pag in the code-behind of the master page inherited from your custommaster

1042324
triggers	insert
in general probably the easiest would be to put the logic into a triggers that would checked to see what value is being insert and change it to your max or min if it s out of bounds

1042339
codeigniter	joomla
for php i am using codeigniter joomla and even wordpress

1042341
textbox	button	radio	click
i have a login screens wheren i have 2 textbox and 2 radio buttons.i have a asp.net button too.when the user click on the button in my code-behind in the click even of button i have the below line to checked the user login

jquery	.post
this is the typical asp.net procedure.now i want to avoid the .post bak of the page and would like to use jquery s form .posting.can any one guide me how to do it

1042345
32-bit	64bit
we notice that its fine on 64bit but on 32-bit it goes bang

1042345
constructor	object
then since i think we can control all use cases is replace the constructor with object initialisation - think this can relieve the pressure on stack

1042350
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i just switching my website over to asp.net-mvc from webforms and i am using ajax very heavily

1042381
implements	sealed
due to the keyword sealed the compiler also knows that you cannot inherited from system.string to add functionality or implements some additional interfaces

1042383
directory	folder
the aspx page in the root directory of the project and the orginfo control is in controls folder

1042398
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
interfaces defined contract which ensures that any two or more classes even if not completely related happens to implements a common interface will contains a common set of operations

1042404
triggers	insert
you need a triggers which fires before both updates and insert or two separate triggerss one for updates and one for insert

1042425
python	php
php itself can be used as templating language for generatin html but in python you will need to use one of the several templating engines available

1042449
value	field
will let you get the field and value members from a given pair without having to remember which member holds what

1042449
value	field
if you expect to use this a lot you could al.so create a macros that will generator those getter for you given the named and types make_pair_getter field string value int or .so

1042453
32-bit	64bit
.so i need to ship two versioning of the same dll - one for 32-bit one for 64bit

1042457
opera-mini	opera
this is similar to what opera does on their opera-mini site

1042461

personally i like django and had success with web.py

1042471
turbogears	pylons
i ve also heard good things about pylons and turbogears

1042472
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu

1042477
rollback	commit
.when something goes wrong eg application ended it will be rollback unless you commit it first

1042502
implements	extends
.so this task now becomes a little more as now you need to write your own virtualizedwrappanel by extends virtualizedpanel and implements iscrollinfo

1042515
arrays	loops
you need too loops through the arrays remembering the smallest value you ve seen .so far

1042516
contains	elements
this will force the elements below the floated elementss which will stretch the contains div

1042536
click	mouse
how can i temporary disable listview selection rectangle .so .when .someone click the listview and holds the button down move the mouse the rectangle is not show

1042550

please upgrade to a new versioning context ssgu5y dc db560 dc db520 userid swg21189712 loc en_us cs utf-8 lang en rss ct632db2

1042567
hide	show
at best you want the psd file which you can then slider it up and hide show layer of things you dont want etc

1042569
png	gif
you mean you have a png gif or jpg screen-shot.

1042597
revision	svn
to fix this situation i take full file content from svn as next revision

1042613
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
if the above is just syntactic-sugar then asp.net-mvc itself is just syntactic-sugar on top of asp.net webforms

1042656
perl	ruby
note that text-manipulation is in general more a scripting operation perl ruby due to regex support in the language itself

1042670
environment	execution
however i tried both queries in the same environment and both gives me the same execution-time and the db execution plan looks exactly the same

1042678
mouseover	mouseout
you have to write events for mouseover and mouseout of the text elements

1042679
quirks-mode	doctype
i seem to remember that if you have anything in front of the doctype in ie6 it send it into quirks-mode

1042688
stateful-session-bean	ejb
i think if you need to inject an stateful-session-bean you gonna need some context that knows the relation between your ejb instances and some previously inject ejb dependency to that instances

1042689
protected	public
the purpose of the methods-signature is to assign a named to a methods and also to describe it s protection level public protected internal private and or virtual which defined where a methods can be accessed from in code

1042707
google-chrome	firefox
a good tool to use for profiling is either firebug in firefox or fiddler for ie google-chrome

1042708
required	checked
one exception-handling should be noted in delphi the free methods may be called on a nil pointers which of course required that kind of checked

1042729
iprincipal	iidentity
please verify that you have implements a class for iidentity iprincipal interface and then you are using something like the following code to assign the currentprincipal

1042733
required	checked
the server is not notified .when the client disconnets since messages are percall by default there is a way use a singleton class as ur servicecontract with instancecontextmode.single then implements an operationcontract with a callback service then .when clients login to ur service they must register with the callback service ur callback service can then cycle through connect clients and checked the status of the callback whether its still open or not finally remove entries where the connections are closed eventually you can get the functionality you required

1042747
getter	setter
secondly .when you need to write multiple entity classes you can push a lot of functionality in to a delegation class and use code templates to write the properties getter setter

1042754
decrement	increment
every call to loadlibrary increment a reference counter freelibrary decrement it

1042768
updating	updates
plus if you need to change your tables in any way you would have to updates your client applications instead of just updating the web service if your queries are generator by the client

1042778
python	ruby
i m interested in python ruby

1042780
textbox	button
in a aspx page of xyz.com i want to have the results of a aspx page of www.abc.com somepage.aspx contains a textbox a combobox a option button and a submit button i want to fill this form and want to click the submit button then to save the details in a file but i want to perfom this action on xyz.com somepage.aspx

1042782
value	field
a more verbose option named grouping will pair field named with value for skurpur

1042784
selected	button
first i show the table content in a gridview and i want to know how to delete the row i selected in the gridview .when i press the delete button from the database

1042805
ienumerator	ienumerable
or should it maybe be an ienumerator instead of ienumerable

1042809
directory	folder
make 1 leaving directory home thayoz desktop untitled folder quantis-usb src linux drivers

1042844
any	set
if you want both eclipse and qtp to coexist you need to make sure any running configuration you may have in or outside eclipse needing to run with qtp are the scripting which set those extra variables _java_home or other

1042859
contains	elements
especially if you are using windows ansi strings be aware that the characters 81 8d 8f 90 and 9d are specified as undefined in the windows-1252 codepages therefore java will produce question marks or exception-handling if your windows strings contains these elements

1042876
easymock	jmock	mocking	stubs
you should mock stubs with one of the mocking apis jmock or easymock and inject the mock into the class-under-test

1042899
environment	building	required	checked
this scripting checked the building environment on your systemd ensuring all the required executable libs etc are available and creates a working makefile

1042913
command-line	cmd
you could use the command-line i o streaming to send in cmd and retrieve the answers

1042916
click	mouse
i cannot use textbox.validating because this event does not fire taking in consideration that the focus will remain on the textbox .when click with the mouse an unfocusable control

1042918
serverxmlhttp	winhttp
winhttp does not use the internet settings that wininet uses hence to configure the proxy that serverxmlhttp will use you need to use the proxycfg cmd

1042944
nested	order
turns out the reject_if didn t work because i was doing the building of the nested shipping_address in the after_initialize callback of the order

1042946
toupper	tolower	uppercase	toupper	uppercase	tolower
.some characters do not round trip toupper ãÿ is ss and tolower ss is ss but there are .some words only distingished by ãÿ vs ss .so will give a false positive is matched by mapping to uppercase and which will break assumptions about case mapping not changing string lengths

1042946
toupper	tolower
tolower i is i unless you have working in turkish or azari where the result is ä latin small letter dotless i and toupper i is ä latin capital letter i with dot above

1042946
toupper	tolower
in the past approaches based on toupper and tolower where making assumptions about working in only english text and ignoring the majority of the worlds glyphs and characters

1042956
innodb	myisam
myisam or innodb for safety of data which should i choose

1042961
g++	gcc
550kb is about as small as you can get it because mingw and gcc g++ in general are bad at stripping unused functions

1042974
required	checked
as the other answers state caching will give you a peformance boost here but do checked if you actually required this for an intranet .app

1042978
google-chrome	safari
does safari and google-chrome support overflow

1042986
handler	service
you can then call the servicecontroller in the event handler to start the service

1042989
innodb	myisam
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

1042997
selected	textbox
right click on your textbox and selected edit control parts templates - edit a copy.

1043013
code-coverage	cobertura
what i recommend doing instead is using a code-coverage tool such as cobertura to ensure that the unit tests you write provide decent coverage of the code in private methods

1043036
constructor	object
unless you write a make_tuple equivalent or constructor then to use this structure as an input parameter you first have to create a temporary object

1043052
order	add
the class does guarantee order - things will be retained in the list in the order you add them including duplicates unless you explicit sort the list

1043071
spritebatch	xna
in xna is there a way to rendering the contents of a spritebatch after drawing to a textures object before renderinging to the screens

1043111
python	php	ruby-on-rails	django
most of sites are written with python django but some of them are using php and ruby-on-rails

1043112
e-commerce	product
we ve got a fairly standards e-commerce scenario with paged lists of product within category

1043132
hide	show
i remember having to actually hide the controls .when i launchd my pop-up and show them again .when the pop-up closes

1043148
hide	show
an ugly work-arround is to hide all combos .when you are going to show the pop-up

1043150
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i tried this and it worked in all browsers ie firefox google-chrome opera and safari

1043185
double	int
try casting one of the int s to a double inside the operation

1043217
duplicates	elements
removing counter from the key will make many rows duplicates with different counter value but all other key elements the same

1043230
perl	php
we ve been asked to support some rather old perl forms on a new site as we re using a php based cms we need to include the perl scripting into our new cms

1043249
required	checked
kb908002 is required for office 2003 applications not for office 2007 - i believe that there are .net hotfix sps that do install this - there is no harm in installing it more than once - it checked to ensure whether has been install

1043257
dynamic-linking	ldd
updates as kristof says this is probably a problem of dynamic-linking but i don t have ldd for android arm.

1043267
hide	show
what i want is to show div #form1 .when selected option 1 and hide form2+form3 or

1043267
hide	show
selected option 2 show div#form2 and hide form1+form2

1043286
perl	php
there is a perl extension available for php

1043290
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql	sql-server	postgresql
it is more or less standardized and used by almost all relational-database management systemd sql-server oracle mysql postgresql db2 informix etc

1043293
python	ruby
i played around with python and studied a bit ruby but frankly i m attracted back to using microsoft s tools c# asp.net-mvc

1043321
text-align	display
al.so not shure what is standards value of display properties for td on ie because it doesn t use table-cell and text-align will not work inside inline elements .so another possible aproach would be to wrap it around another div

1043340
order	join
someone suggested me to move variables assignments to join or order clause but the problem remains

1043350
webrequest	webclient
i suggest setting a longer timeout on the request but you d need to use webrequest instead because there is no way to set a timeout on webclient

1043360
constructor	object
it s simpler to just tweak the python object constructor instead of loading a sql database

1043360
python	c++	python	java
you are free to write a lot of code that crash and burns in a language c# vb c++ java or python

1043384
hide	show
wouldn t it be better to only hide the previously show div

1043395
arrays	loops
just basic set up and starting a loops to go through all bytes in the arrays

1043395
binary	hex	digits	base
bytes .when converted to hex are two hex digits or 8 binary digits depending on what base you look at it in

1043395
digits	zero
here we re display the actual hex digits basically just using the zero or a character as a starting points and shifting up to the correct character

1043400
png	gif
for non-animated gif images a conversion to png8 should be painless and beneficial as png compresses much better

1043400
png	gif
also internet-explorer 6 doesn t exhibit problems display png images with a 1 bit alpha channel which is essentially what gif has too

1043401
png	gif
png afaik will always be a smaller file size than gif because it uses a better compression algorithm

1043405
python	ruby
for ruby and python respectively

1043408
mouseover	mouseout
i know i can use mouseover mouseout to bind the event with .live

1043408
mouseover	mouseout
which is a good solution if it weren t for mouseover mouseout bad habit to break the event if you hover a child elements of the current elements the mouseover is bound to

1043408
mouseover	mouseout
or should i just roll over and use mouseover mouseout with live

value	field
yes assuming you have a unique id field you can delete all recording that are the same except for the id but don t have the minimum id for their grouping of value

1043528
ftp	scp
copying a dumped table to another server via ftp scp or something like that might be quick but in my eyes it is also very quick and dirty and i d love to have a nicer solution

1043532
environment	building
basically you set a couple of environment variables up reference them in all the .csproj files .so that you can cater for different working directory for each individual developer install the stylecop msbuilding components on the building machine and you re off

1043550
key-value	key
to do this i first have to insert data in tablea then find and retrieve tablea s last insert primary key and use it as the foreign key-value in tableb

1043559
delta	diff
then you would use a diff algorithm to extraction only the delta information

1043567
ubuntu	linux
this issue occurs at least with java versioning 1.6.0_13 and 1.6.0_10 and linux versioning ubuntu 9.04 and rhel 4.6

postgresql	oracle	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	postgresql
i m specially interested on sql-server even though answers with other databases oracle postgresql at least could also be interesting

1043628
contains	set
in essence you ll be using dbunit to set up your test database with a known and representative set of data and then plain junit to exercise the methods contains your hql queries and verify the results

1043628
contains	set
set up your database first to contains only a fixed set of data

1043634
perl	php
then perl or php or whatever your poison of choice is should contains the digits

1043635
svg	vml
in one of the few post on the subject groups.google.co.in it is explained that for example browsers which doesn t support svg or vml send placemark polygons polyline information to google where the map will be rendering and sent back

1043635
svg	vml
from what i ve found ie6 does not have support for svg or vml and thus not capable of rendering the information by itself

1043658
constructor	private	constructor	object	instances	private

in the end we opted for installing review-board in parallels to trac

1043690
svg	vml
google-maps uses vml on ie browsers and svg on the others

1043698
stderr	stdout
you should consume the stdout and stderr in separate threads otherwise you will experience blocking behavior

1043716
stderr	stdout
also you read the stderr and stdout sequentially

1043716
stderr	stdout
however the read to stderr blocks as there are no errors printed by the application and you don t move to the phase where you read the stdout

1043716
stderr	stdout
you could join the stderr and stdout via processbuilder.redirecterrorstream and then you need only to read stdout

1043716
stderr	stdout
your sample works in some cases because .when you are blocked on the stderr the application response on the stdout doesn t hit the size of the communication buffering

1043716
stderr	stdout
.when the application quits the stderr loops exit and loopss for stdout is able to retieve the contents of that buffering

1043729
getter	setter
synthesize the setter and or getter

1043757
swing	awt
if i replace the swing jbutton with an awt button like .so

1043767
negative-number	zero
if any value are null then those clauses will return false .so we need to use isnull to fix things up and replace nulls with a large negative-number or zero if you do not expect any negative prices

1043777
floor	ceil
you should probably apply ceil or floor before casting to an int

1043796
double	int
i don t think the cast is necessary there is an implicit-cast from double to int

1043812
double	int
you don t need to cast double are casted automatically to int if needed

1043812
double	int
.when casting double to int the decimal places are truncated and not rounded

1043824
groovy	java
you can types with java styles or groovy still you can also mix both and have no worry about that

1043834
decrement	increment
don t increment and compare with maximum decrement and compare with zero instead

i tested in firefox 3.0.10 and it worked .so by the looks of it jquery user-interface is not all that compatible with safari 4.0.1 4.0 4530.17 or just maybe their demos on their site

1044007
machinist	faker
you may also want to take a look at machinist and or faker which machinist uses but is a gem in its own right

1044009
implements	extends
a more elegant solution would be to write your own authentication action-filter either by extends authentication or implements iauthenticationfilter as follows

at the moment i am thinking it could be a separate function which loops through the returned arrays adding place_parent_x elements as it goes but am not sure how to implements this

1044100
implements	abstract
create a viewmodel with abstract of properties and in this viewmodel implements crud methods

1044129
python	c++
neither do i miss most of python dynamic features .when writing c++ lambda i miss bring on c++0x even if the syntax is horrible

1044129
python	c++
likewise the c++ automatic refactoring operation of change the parameters and see what fails to compile needs some modification in python if you want to locate all call sites

1044129
python	c++
you therefore have to make sure you re running the right subset of tests since a full unit test run of a large python .app will take far longer than is acceptable in the compile phase of your current c++ code compile code compile code compile test cycle

note that the binary-tree is just a special case of the multi-way tree where the child nodes are known to be the left child and the right child

1044248
gnome	kde
in linux it gets murky since the desktop environment gnome or kde keeps its own list of applications to run for each file types

1044269
key-value	key
here is the interface and a sample class that implementss it.notice that the class key is strongly typed to the enum and that the ivaluedescritionitem proprties are implementss explicit .so the class can have whatever properties and you can choose the ones that implements the key-value pair

1044269
key-value	key
you can of course chose to turn myitem into a key-value class used only for this puprose effectively skipping myitem in the types arguments of enumtoreadnlycollection altogether but then you d be forced to go with int for the key meaning getting combobox1.selectedvalue would return int and not the enum types

1044278
configuration	environment
i d like if there were a different answer to this but i think you ll have to checked the file as.sociations configuration for every desktop environment and file-manager out there .so nautilus konqueror thunar mc.

1044678
any	set
recursive-descent can handle any grammar which is ll that is unlimited lookahead as well as a small set of ambiguous grammars

1044678
recursive-descent	lalr
as a matter of interest it is also worth looking into recursive-ascent which is a parsing algorithm directly encode after the fashion of recursive-descent but capable of handling any lalr grammar

1044699
contains	set
i have a set of resource-files that contains translation strings

1044714

1044739
sqlplus	prompt
i think i have everything configure but i m receiving this error from the sqlplus prompt after trying a remote query

1044761
sql-server	oracle
it seems that it s posible to block tables with selected through oracle dblinks because it s not posible to defined the dblink as read uncommited but the problem can be solved with another db systemd which supports that feature like sql-server

1044761
any	set
what we did to get around this was to by-pass the odbc drivers from oracle to progress all together as any locked columns on the progress side bombed out for us .when selected over the db_link even with us set transactional readonly

1044761
sql-server	oracle
we instead used sql-server as the buffering between oracle and progress

1044761
sql-server	oracle
.so we created sql-server views of progress tables via a sql-server linked-server and then we selected from those views from a db_link from oracle to sql-server

1044888
scripting	shebang
lack of shebang doesn t however imply it can t be run as a scripting as long as one knows where php is where the scripting is and can access a command-prompt can probably launchd it anyway

1044912
put	get
some people like to put as much as possible in the model-validation data retrieval etc and have the controllers just poke it to get the data it needs which it then hands over to the view

1045086
reflection	runtime
i m open anything from the int value 12 all the way to some sort of introspection reflection though built-in features and elegance are preferable to hacks runtime wrapper and modification

1045103
getter	setter
this types of cross-behavior getter and setter would allow communication .when it is required

1045103
python	lua
i d suggest looking at a scripting-language like lua or python for this

1045141

textbox	button
i have a textbox combo box button and datagridview on a form that is used to search and return customer information from a mssql view vcustomer

1045180
scheme	let

1045190
environment	building
it covers the foundation on which all the java web-frameworks building upon web application containers environment deployment lifecycle... in a very accessible way however it does not give you an overview over the huge amount of frameworks that are available

bufferedreader	filewriter
have you looked into file filereader filewriter bufferedreader

1045253
fread	eof
the return-value of fread is not a boolean but the numbers of bytes actually read which will differ from 4 in the case of an eof or if an error occurred

1045253
hash	md5
first use a simple cryptography hash like md5 not crc32

1045259
python	java
the main problem with your python-to-java translation is that python assignment statement up there is execute all at once while java s are execute serially

1045298
javascript	dom
if you want to manipulate the data in the dom consider json which is quite compatible with javascript

1045315
value	field
also if your types contains many field and then is passed from methods to methods you will be copying every field s value on each methods call thus using more memory than if you had used a class in the first place

1045322
javascript	dom
jeremy keith s excellent book dom scripting showed me how to create an addloadevent function to a separate javascript file that allows for multiple functions to be loaded inside it

1045322

1045426
persistent	transient
this is really just a case of understanding how your application will be creating an object graphing and what entities are transient and which might be persistent or detached

1045426
persistent	transient
i would recommend reading this entire chapter from the hibernate docs to understand fully the terminology of transient persistent and detached

1045434
display	height
i know you have to defined the height styles to 100 in firefox just to get the control to display

1045441
buildpath	libs
in your project properties dialog project menu properties under java buildpath selected the libs tab

1045468

1045544
stax	sax
my search has led me to several sax and stax implementation but they all seem to operate on inputstream and inputsources--not nio channels

.so i don t use mouse events but keyboard events which doesn t give me a listviewitem of course

1045634
rollback	commit
do transactional cmd like begin tran rollback and commit make any difference

1045637
contains	elements
i may only be speculating but i would take the dom and search for elements that could contains plaintext inside which i would do a search of that elements contents and child elements

1045644
contains	any
i tried to downloading fckeditor but there was no bin file contains any dll s after extraction the zip from filename fckeditor_2.6.4.zip

1045680
optional-parameters	named
with c# 4 this will be less useful as there will be optional-parameters and named arguments

1045693
derived-class	base-class
you have to call the base-class constructor from your derived-class

1045696
modbus	tcp-ip
it can be connect via tcp-ip using the common modbus protocols a hand-coded drivers is usually no more than a few dozen line

1045697
contains	any
each component could have a directory contains dlls from the other components that need to be referenced stored in svn but this would mean extra effort any time core is updates to push out the new dlls to alpha and beta

1045717
authentication	login
i want to add authentication to it .so that whenever anyone makes a call to a function in .soap_server_map it checked that the credentials supplied in the .soap-client options arrays login and passwd are valid

1045742
show	next
button next to the bottom list box in the dialog that show up

1045746
contains	any
each component could have a directory contains dlls from the other components that need to be referenced stored in svn but this would mean extra effort any time core is updates to push out the new dlls to alpha and beta

1045751
contains	elements
instead of putting each list with repeat id s and directory in seperate lists why not make the file elements of the list another sub list which contains all the files which have the same id and directory

1045779
perl	php	contains	any
you might be able to come up with some php page that contains the output of the perl scripting but you ll never be able to feed any changes on that page back into the perl scripting

1045788
constructor	object
.when using it in the real code either send in the real object or use a different constructor that creates an ipropertiesmanager

1045807
http-request	httpresponse
http-request and httpresponse pre asp.net-mvc used to have a getinputstream and getoutputstream that could be used for that purpose

1045811
temporary	copy
it would be better to make everything contingent on a successful copy or test for the existence of the temporary file or to operate on the copy

1045828
javascript	dom
this means that you can put the javascript anywhere in the html instead of at the bottom which with vanilla javascript is the only place you can put it to guarantee that it ll work on the whole dom instead of what s currently loaded

1045837
contains	elements
for example one of the the elements contains an ascii heart 3 without the quotes which the xml parsing sees as an opening tag

1045849
filenotfoundexception	runtimeexception
you just wrap the filenotfoundexception in a runtimeexception

1045865
keyboard	mouse
a keyboard action that depends on the mouse positioning sounds a little unorthodox

1045865
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse	highlight	selected
keyboard actions should normally effect some item that is highlight focused selected on the screens either selected by previous keyboard actions or by a previous mouse click on that item

1045873
contains	elements
if you are adding another column be sure to account for the additional width plus margins and either reduce width on other elementss or increase the width of your contains elements

1045873
contains	elements
since the contains elements for your columns will be the user s screens if you use percentage then the column sizes should adjust relative to their resolution windows size

1045879
entitydatasource	formview
using a formview i bind to the request data request_det entitydatasource and can see the relevant information for the request for the related tables username requestno but i get the numeric value for the req_status

1045885
javascript	dom
once a browser loads the page then all the other magic happens - layout box model stuff dom generator and many other things including javascript execution

1045885
output	mode
escaping from php mode to direct output mode

1045885
json	xml
or json or xml etc

1045938
export	report
.when the pdf file is rendering via the reportviewer s built-in export function the width and height of each page within the pdf will be determined by the width and height in the report s pagesize attributes you could overrides this if you used your own custom code for the pdf rendering

1045938
show	next
.so the first 7.5 or .so of each page of my report s body will be show in the first page and the rest will be split down to the next page

1045938
export	report
this will not be done inside the report viewer as it allows for the report to grow beyond the page size by just adding a scrollbar but it will be annoyingly noticeable in the pdf export

1045970
binaries	install
you don t need to have stylecop install on your or the building machine - simply add stylecop s binaries to your source control about 1.5 mb of stuff

1045992
versioning	staging
it s really easy to use and setup the free versioning just lets you deploy to one server but if you are willing to pay you can deploy to different servers staging development and production

1045995
32-bit	64bit
edit as far as i can tell unlike for 32-bit code you have to supply the stubs helpers yourself and since i don t know how the 64bit stubs helpers works i ll do as bastien said and have gcc link it since it include it s own stubs helpers

1046014
contains	any
any page that accesses the inventory will need to reference the file that contains the item and inventory classes

1046068
python	c++	python	java	udp	tcp
let s say i m programming in java or python or c++ for a simple problem could be to building an tcp udp echo server or computation of factorial

1046089
selected	cell	selection	cell
.when selected a row in the gui jtable and printing the table.getselectedrow value i always get -1 after changing the table data with a model.replace cell call from the first selection even if i reselect the first jcombobox option

1046114
rollback	commit
it s implicit stated in msdn where for sqltransactional object the commit methods is said to fail if the transactional has already been rollback on the server.

1046120
implements	extends
i ll points out that in my experience this is why i tend to extends abstracttablemodel or out right implements my own tablemodel interface from the ground up

1046134
configuration	environment
splitting the configuration into different files is very useful if the lifecycle of your project has it moving from one environment to another

1046134
versioning	staging
if you keep all the configuration in app-config and a settings change has been made to the dev versioning of app-config it will get copy-paste up and clobber the staging versioning - now your qa people are points to the dev database

1046134
configuration	environment
by keeping database.xml seperate from app-configuration you can allow for difference between the various environment but still allow changes to configuration files to flow from each environment to the next without worrying about overwriting a customization

1046141
python	java
if you are programming in python or in java the interpreter and the virtual-machine respectively abstract this layer of the architecture

1046149
python	java
in java and python architecture details are abstracted away .so that it is in fact more or less impossible to write architecture-dependant code

1046162
callback	methods
methods to callback after the save

1046186
attributes	properties
but .when i try to switching to using properties injection with the servicedependency attributes on the properties the injection is not happening the properties stays null

1046199
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
you likely want to take a look at autoresetevent and manualresetevent

1046210
build-process	teamcity
almost certainly teamcity is running it s build-process as local system.in a non-interactive mode and not as a user that actually has the access and ability to grab the graphics device

1046221
erlang	scala
erlang and scala are probably the chief representatives of this model with erlang process and scala actors

1046234
forms-authentication	security
.when you set security with forms-authentication in the web-config you then lose the ability to access the rss feed

1046238
entity-framework	nhibernate
that s what nhibernate and the younger brother entity-framework and it s cousin linq2sql are for

1046239
put	get
now i have put it on the show event but this seems not to get triggers consistently or before the page is fully created the first time

1046240
configuration	logging
app-config have good support to connection and logging configuration which you will use in almost all applications

1046248
distance	polygons
i m looking for a polygons object points object and some operations like union intersection distance and area

1046260
bazaar	git
others popular tools in this category include git and bazaar

thanks to kirk for points out that audience targeting only works in moss and not wss

1046278
worksheet	excel
lists don t need to be in excel worksheet i can export-to-csv file and work from there i don t need an ms office interface

1046286
httphandler	httpmodule
create an httpmodule that intercepts request to document in this file shared and presents them through an httphandler to the user

1046293
contains	any
i know it is something to do with the release of ajaxpro but does any of you have a versioning which doesn t contains that error

1046296
triggers	insert
you could insert the rows on the database and on insert determine the carrier and include it in the recording maybe in an insert triggers

1046303
caliburn	prism
assuming you have picked silverlight then comes the difficult task do you use code-behind mvp asp.net-mvc mvvm prism caliburn slextensions

1046319
any	set
.when i set any one of the textbox control s enabled properties to false i d like to swap that textbox out for a labels at runtime

1046321
any	set
is there any way i can set the limit .when using the named query and not .when defining it

1046328
base-class	inherited
.so i made a base-class which inherited from user-controls and all my controls inherited from base-class

1046328
base-class	inherited
however if i add controls for base-class in the designer such as a tablelayoutpanel i can t access them .when i m designing the inherited classes

1046328
base-class	inherited
right now i simply removed all controls from base-class added the layout and all the common-controls in each of the inherited class then use references to manipulate them inside base-class

1046362
decimal	hex
the length is being display in hex .so 0x0013 is 19 decimal

add-on product visual-studio outlook plugins

1046370
put	get
i want to be able to .somehow put the path of the cd .something like d productname prerequisites dotnetfx35clientsetup.exe .so it can get it and install it from there

1046373
haskell	scala	haskell	erlang	erlang	scala
i m amused that ancient work like ml caml haskell and erlang is being passed off as new. scala is genuinely new and f# is an attempt to adapt an old language ml into the .net and is bound to be interesting

1046373
haskell	agda
if you want something really new agda is the new haskell

1046373
haskell	agda
agda incorporates the many lessons learned from 20-year-old languages like haskell and 30-year-old languages like ml and it pushes the envelope with the very latest work in type-systems

1046376
spring.net	csla
a cursory investigation has identified product such as strataframe mere mortals csla deklarit xepressapp habanero spring.net etc

1046400
contains	set
make a set for each carrier to contains all the prefixes

1046443
fancybox	lightbox
fancybox scale it .so that the lightbox is really wide and not very tall which means you can t really see the image at all

1046446
key-value	key
this way you have key-value pairs and your key could be the phone numbers and your value the total minutes

1046458
ms-access	mysql
unfortunately the limit keyword isn t available in ms-access -- that s what is used in mysql for a multi-page presentation

1046462
protected	public
the specifications states that an entity must have a public or protected no-arg ctor

1046467
perl	c++	python	c++	python	perl
perl and python also come with implementation of md5 sha1 and sha2 and will probably run as fast as in c++

1046493
selected	textbox
this is the solution i used on our webapp for two custom-controls a popup calendar and a popup unit value weight selector click the textbox popup a div with two selected

1046496
integration	payment
if however it is a valid credit-card numbers but it does not match your .post code db third party integration required then that is a payment error

1046499
managed-code	unmanaged
i do not want to convert my unmanaged c++ native application to managed-code

1046513
credentials	account
.so i need .some way to pass the credentials or at least to run with a specified account and then configure the remote site to thrust that account.

1046515
managed-code	unmanaged
to call into managed-code from unmanaged c++ use clrcreatemanagedinstance or export your types in your managed assembly as com visible and use com

1046518
authentication	login
depends on the client i guess - i know some desktop readers sure others do as well support feed that required authentication and provide a login box .when first requesting it - not sure what they are doing behind the scenes to make it work though

1046566
silverlight	wpf
works in both wpf and silverlight

1046572
contains	lookup
sets do provide fast value-based lookup via contains

1046580
integrated-security	connection-string
in the connection-string use the tag integrated-security sspi

1046593
dictionary	arrays
braces are used to indicate a dictionary associativity arrays

1046607
packaging	building
there are multiple options for packaging visual-studio does provide an option to building install project with the runtime

1046617
keyboard	mouse
mouse and keyboard input audio

1046622
32-bit	64bit
but since a 32-bit processor uses 32-bit addresses and a 64bit processor uses 64bit addresses i think would padding be totally unnecessary since all of the value of the struct addresses which are efficient by their very nature are in ideal 32-bit chunks

1046623
inno-setup	nsis
nsis and inno-setup have scripting that will do the same thing

1046632
order	add
this can really be a pita .when you use many parameters in a query because you have to be careful to add them in the right order which can easily lead to bugs

1046669
udp	tcp
ok this might just be a dumb question but i was wondering if bluetooth follows tcp or udp protocols

1046688
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are transport level protocolss whereas bluetooth would be a low-level protocols

1046688
udp	tcp
thus you could use tcp or udp on top of bluetooth just as you use tcp and udp on top of ethernet

1046705
value	field
assign value to each field separately

1046709
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	seam	tapestry	jsf	wicket	seam	wicket	jsf	seam	jsf
there are lots to choose from spring-mvc struts 2 jsf tapestry wicket seam and .so on

1046710
stderr	stdout
there are 2 devenv executable one is devenv.com which is a console mode application that handles stdin stdout and stderr proxy for the other executable devenv.exe which is a gui mode application

1046718
spring	seam	tapestry	spring	tapestry	seam
better off starting from a good base with lots of developer expertise like spring struts seam or tapestry

1046737
32-bit	64bit
.so if you are expecting 6gb dataset for .some computation let s say .something that needs incoherent access and can t just be streamed a bit at a time on a 64bit architecture you could just read it into ram and do your stuff whereas on a 32-bit architecture you need a fundamentally different way to approach it since you simply do not have the option of keeping the entire dataset resident

1046782
oracle	mysql
we do not want to go with enterprise class database solutions like mysql or mssql or oracle since the application does not have huge amounts of data to store

1046795
lookup	any
i would lookup how to do it on osx chances are that ll be how it s done on the iphone but you probably won t find any iphone specific documentation about it because it s not allowed on a normals iphone one that is not jailbroken

1046812
linux	osx
unless of course you re trying to target osx and linux users in which case i would consider a serious examination into the value of those markets before you make any decisions to abandon your codebase

1046814
hash	md5
if you have the opportunity to store the original named in a database i would simply create a file with a random hash mt_rand md5 sha1

1046816
webforms	asp.net
i have an existing asp.net webforms application that i would like to add some unit-testing to but am unsure of exactly how to go about it

1046818
contains	any
therefore it appears that an empty string is contains in any string

1046820
arrays	loops
i ve located the scriptinging to search for a single file a scripting to open files in photoshop but i m hopeless at arrays and loops assuming applescripting can do this

1046832
compression	streaming
like an encryption or compression streaming

1046847
python	php
i m storing a value in memcachedd using php s memcached extension and trying to retrieve it in a daemons written in python sitting behind my webapp

1046847
python	php
if i try setting the key on a python terminal it returns false and unsets it i can no longer retrieve it through php

1046855
overlap	padding
if both those hold there is no room for any padding in the struct since field are not allowed to overlap

1046859
python	php
by default the php client stores key in php s serialization format which python won t understand by default

1046867
move-constructor	std
regarding 1 std move does a simple cast - it does not create an object from a copy - if it did then the move-constructor might get invoked by it but since it does a simple rvalue cast it doesn t get invoked

1046874
arrays	loops
generally the accepted answer seems to be that you either do it in your application logic read in what you have into an arrays then loops through the arrays and create the missing dates or you use temporary tables filled with the dates you wish to join

1046875
deployment	install
this types of deployment also takes care of ensuring any dependencies are downloading and install to the clients systemd which only needs to be done once all subsequent updates only required the latest versioning of changed assemblies to be downloading and install.

1046907
transformation	dimension
the book is specifically geared towards what you want linear transformation of 2 and 3-dimensional vector spaces and treats it with a geometric approach in full progressive detail 300 pages for each dimension

1046916
gridview	listview	databound	gridview
in asp.net-mvc you really want to avoid databound controls like repeater gridview listview

1046933
pthreads	fork
i gather process grouping are transfer by fork from the pthreads definition of fork

1046939
linked-list	nodes
now you ve built a linked-list of two nodes

1046946
double	int
in other words an int and an short won t necessarily compare like this nor would an int and a double

1046946
reflection	runtime
you could also go down the path of using reflection to dynamically invoke the default properties on the generics types determined at runtime by the supplied types variables but i wouldn t want to do that if i didn t have to for performance and compile-time safety or lack thereof reasons

1046956
textbox	button
now the button and textbox properties are binding fine on first load and the propertychanged event is firing and doing its thing

1046977
double	int
for strings double int etc it was pretty much baked in but if you used custom object you could write the audit implementation for them that just had to return a audit object

1046980
python	php
edit allow me to clarify my goal as i have been told python does a lot more than php

1047037
export	report
sql-server report service in sql-server 2008 supports native export to words document

1047043
credentials	account
playing a bit with my google sigh-in and other sites of theirs orkut.com it looks like .when you hit a page that needs credentials it redirects you to a common site for account login which then redirects you back to the original site presumably passing some sort of session token in the url

1047060
base-class	inherited
currently i have set up a class that inherited masterpage to act as the base-class for the base master page

1047067
duplicates	lookup
also you don t have to duplicates the lookup among different implementsation -- various classes can implements ivisitor to create type-specific functionality

1047075
double	int
1 adt which means basically a new types something like int int or real numbers double or even a new concept like date

1047075
double	int
look at double and int in c++ the int is a sun of double because every int is a double at least in concept

1047085
contains	any
.when i write it adds the delegation contains the current handler if any to the inner class s event

1047089
hide	show
can someone please let me know that if i have a webpage that consists of a checkbox parent and on this same webpage i also have a iframe that is sourced from another page that display a numbers of recordinging which also has a checkbox children against each recording if i tick the parent checkbox and assume the iframe is hidden from the user have a feature to show hide iframe can i set all children checkbox within this hidden iframe or does the iframe need to be rendering

1047106
cryptographic-hash-function	hash
now if the only reason you can t work backwards in a cryptographic-hash-function was because the hash-function discards data to create the hash then it would not guarantee preimage resistance you can still work backwards and just insert random data wherever the hash-function discards data and while you wouldn t come up with the original messages you d still come up with a messages that hash to the desired hash value

1047126
logout	login
if your login session is stored by a cookies and there are nothing else you need to supply to logout of application b clearing the cookies in javascript will usually destroy the session and sign the user out

1047128
hide	show
you can of course further re-factor the code to hide show the right view

1047142
.when	ready
you can set all the checkbox and display to the user .when ready

1047144
widget	button
it annoys to have the default behavior to dismiss this dialog same as the default ok button is pressed .when enter return is pressed whichever widget i was in

1047152
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
does every file need to #include stdafx.h .when using precompiled-headers

1047153
exception-handling	try-catch
oh and in case you re wondering about the nasty try-catch thing i found some exception-handling with words .when pasting some field but the try-catch works fine in the dev

1047154
environment	building
i am using javaw to run an application in os x 10.5.7 java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_13-b03-211 and it seems that the command-line arugments are broken in os x

1047161
.net	wcf
how do you approach contract-first service design with .net and wcf

1047175
selected	checkbox
the problem is that .when no checkbox are selected the div flashes on momentarily and then disappears

1047204
cross-compiling	qmake
i have install mingw in linux and qmake but i dont know how to proceed with cross-compiling

1047204
cross-compiling	qmake
how do i link my qt with a cross-compiling like mingw and qmake

1047212
c++	lua
i m lead dev for bitfighter a game primarily written in c++ but using lua to scripting robot player

1047212
c++	lua
i m now wrestling with how our lua scripting can know that an object they have a reference to has been deleted by the c++ code

1047212
c++	lua
first we could create some sort of lua function that the c++ code can call .when a ship or other item dies

1047212
c++	lua
now lua has total control over the lifecycle of the luaship c++ can delete ships without causing problems and everything seems to work smoothly

1047231
difference	factors
i think the difference is that rather than saying i want to be good at design i am asking how i can improve my undestanding of the human factors that makes a design a good one i don t know if that s sufficxiently different or not i hope .so

1047237
sql-server	ms-access	sql-server	oracle	ms-access	oracle
if i have an ms-access database with linked-tables from two different database servers say one table from an sql-server db and one from an oracle and i write a query which join those two tables how will access or the jet engine i guess

1047239
keydown	keyup
you can use a keydown or keyup event that sets a function to run in 1 second and if the user types another key within that second you can clear the timeout and set a new one

1047240
web.py	django	pylons	django	pylons	web.py	turbogears	django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears	web.py
use django turbogears web.py cheerpy pylons etc etc

1047245
virtual-memory	paging
probably the best solution for now is to use the full 2mb bytebuffer and let the os take care of paging to disk virtual-memory if that s necessary

1047255
contains	set
here you need a templates with replaceable set of columns contains

1047308
c++	lua
numbers 2 isn t as hard as you think write or borrow a reference-counting pointers on the c++ side and if your lua c++ glue is accustomed to dealing with c++ pointerss it ll probably work without further intervention unless you re generator binding by inspector symbols tables at runtime or something

1047314
subroutine	scoping
can the subroutine access the my scoping flag variables

1047328
repr	eval
if you want to save it in an easy to read json-like format use repr to serialization the object and eval to deserialization it

1047339
r5rs	r6rs
in standards scheme r4rs r5rs or r6rs the code should work unmodified

1047368
gethashcode	equals
required overrides equals object and gethashcode methods

1047386
put	get
an alternate approach extends the wtf factors - trying to get around the intptr issue is to just put the intptr into a system.io.stream using

1047391
scala	java
i was wondering if there would be a way to get a hmac-sha1 signature in scala without having to compile a java class with the code everyone use in java

1047392
data-structures	dictionary
it works extremely well for nested dictionary and lists but scale for more complex data-structures ones involving custom object as well and its big plus is that the format is readable

1047400
show	next
.when i use mediawiki-syntax first-level bullet pointss pressing enter key show a bullet points for the next line as well

1047407
ogre3d	physx
i m using ogre3d and physx

1047429
web-applications	webserver	webserver	nginx
wsgi is the crucial glue between webserver not just the simple one in wsgiref of course -- real ones too such as apache or nginx both with respective modules called mod_wsgi as well as for example google-app-engine -- that one offers wsgi too as its fundamental api and web-applications and frameworks that make it easier to write such applications

1047434
postgresql	mysql
here are the documentation pages related to-date time functions for both mysql and postgresql

1047437
paintcomponent	draw
if one needs to actually make a subclassing of jcomponent which display a seven-segment digit-like display by writing a custom paintcomponent methods to draw the digits

1047442
tuples	any
a loops or something 100 equivalent like a list-comprehension or genexp is really the only approach if your outer-level structure is a tuples as you indicate -- tupless are by deliberate design an extremely light-weight containers with hardly any methods in fact just the few special methods needed to implements indexing loopsing and the like

1048426
delphi	c++
as far as a general programming language platform is concerned you pretty much can t get any better than c# .net these days .so assuming that after all the due-diligence you still want to move then you d be forced to choose .something that doesn t required a runtime - the only conceivable option would be c++ or delphi

as you touch the button it display what you are typing inside this textbox at the top of the on-screen-keyboard

1048828
versioning	packaging
in your case there is no containers but you could mix up libs versioning during packaging deployment or have different classpath for development and execution

1048863
javascript	dom
but if your intent is really to submit these forms by a single piece of javascript i have a small advise javascript supports lookup of form tags dynamically in a dom tree as show in above example by aquatic

1048881
jquery	.post
after some validation i use jquery to .post the page

1048900

use the modulo to perform get division remainder

1048968
qtextstream	qfile
assign a qtextstream to a qfile and reading it line-by-line is easy and works fine but i wonder if the performance can be inreased by first storing the file in memory and then process it line-by-line

1048968
qiodevice	qfile	qbytearray	qiodevice	qbytearray	qfile
qfile is inherited from qiodevice which allows me to readall it into qbytearray but how to proceed then and divide it into line

i was just wondering if you know of something with ie8 that would cause it to recognize the mouse click only .when positioning over text in the cell and not the entire table cell

1049193
getter	setter
you may well want to only put the getter in the interface though - it s slightly unusual to include a setter in an interface

1049193
implements	abstract	getter	setter
there are oddities if you want to overrides an existing or abstract properties which only has a getter to add a setter but it s okay to implements a getter-only interface with setter as well i believe.

1049246
3des	aes
.so for strong encryption provided by .net you d be best off going for either 3des 168 bit effectively or aes up to 256 bit - the latter is implements under its original named of rijndael as .net first published this libs before the aes selection process had formally ended

1049392
lookup	any
if you have only single indic then any lookup within these recordinging will take 100 000 step one for each recording retrieved by the first index

1049392
value	field
if you have a composite index then your search is much faster because your second field search will have an index within the first set of value

1049392
value	field
in this case you ll need no more than 17 step to get to your first matching value on field 2 within the 100 000 matches on field 1 log base 2 of 100 000

addtitional info autocommit normally default to true in sqlite it of course could al.so depend on the access layer you use -- i am using python and apsw .so i can t tell you more about this in java

1049480
difference	zero
edit for the other half finding the int points that intersect the edges i suspect that it s the greatest common denominator between the x and y difference between the points minus one or if the distance minus one if one of the x or y difference is zero

1049485
constructor	private
if you don t want your constructor be called other than from in your getinstance methods you can make it private

1049485
constructor	private
will cause a compile error because your constructor is private

1049505
contains	lookup
assuming i m using c# is there a data structure that better encapsulates this sort of usage and could contains an arbitrary numbers of key with hashtable-like lookup performance

1049520
value	field
if field and value are both identifier where an identifier is a non-empty string of alphabetic characters allowing a value to be empty as in your example you could do something like

1049520
value	field
since the lexer can t tell a field from a value you d need to let the lexer treat them the same and use the parsing to tell the difference based on the context

1049522
asp.net-mvc	wcf
asp.net-mvc calling wcf service through ajax

1049527
command-line	cmd
however i think you should be able to do all of this quite easily as .post building cmd since its all just command-line stuff

1049529
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
same is true for oracle mysql and postgresql

1049542
reflection	runtime
something to recognize is that it isn t the concept of a viewmodel that allows runtime optimizations it s the fact that many viewmodels don t throw away the original program meta-data and have built-in functionality for reflection

1049546
linked-list	arrays
while a linked-list is not arrays based .so no indexes it makes sense to provide a methods like that .sometimes you need to know the last item

1049550
constructor	object
basically what i do is crawl the assembly for nontrivial types then write a constructor that uses add-member add them in a structured way to the object i care about

1049575
any	set
from those two slopes and any given y coordinate less than the highest points you should be able to compute the numbers of int pointss that appear within the bounds set by the slopes

1049588
bash	zsh
in both zsh and bash 4.0

1049612
backslash	regex
details depends on what characters your specific regex systemd considers magic needing a backslash escape to be taken literalsly -- here i m assuming a dialect with magic characters as a separator + and to indicate repetition and parentheses to form grouping .so i m escaping the slash to make it be literals

1049627
pointers	stack
with a reference-type a class stack frame has to allow for the storage of a pointers to the object on the heap whereas with a struct all the struct primitive field must be added to stackframes footprint

1049650
assign	add
in project-structure add facets to your module of choice and assign the recently defined datasource to the new facets

1049654
32-bit	64bit
please state if you are running 64bit - and have you tried the same code on a 32-bit os

1049667
communication	messages
once the mindset is changed to this and the data flow is no longer seen as recording with key x of table y but instead messages communication the purchase of item x by customer y the solution becomes easier to understand and apply

1049672
scons	cmake
i just converted my project 15000 line of c++ code building shared-libraries unit tests and executable to cmake from scons a couple of weeks ago and it only took a day or two to do

1049672
cmake	bjam
one thing i found helpful was that the boost project now has experimental support for cmake rather than bjam

1049675
document	editing
i need to convert words document to xml and back once editing has been performed on it

1049679
getter	setter
is this even possible for starters because this is about adding protocols to setter and a getter is much more easy like

1049687
implements	abstract
i guess it s not part of the list interface because they wanted to seperate out different abstract data types into seperate interfaces even though an implementsation like linked-list can implements more than one interface

1049693
sqldatasource	gridview
not sure about how this works with objectdatasource but with sqldatasource we set key on the rows of the gridview

1049707
value	field
you could modify it to also checked for null value but i do not believe you have that issue because if you had a null in your contacts.organization your entire result field would be null instead of blank

1049722
complement	bit-shift
hence i wanted to start this community wiki .post to defined what two s complement is how to use it and how it can affect numbers during operations like casts from signed to unsigned and vice versa bit-wise operations and bit-shift operations

1049732
actionscript	mxml
i ve defined .some panelss in the mxml and set .so that the new panels i ve created in actionscript will be added to the coverflow containers

1049734
contains	any
i could write my own wrapper around boost-thread to handle this but that doesn t help if the user boost-bind s an object that contains my object i can t specialize based on the presence of a member types -- at least i don t know of any way to do that and uses that to start a boost-thread

1049734
contains	any
the only means i can think of required too much work from users -- i provide a wrapper around boost-thread that call a special hook methods on the object being passed in provided it exists and users add the special hook methods to any class that contains my object

1049748
children	nodes
since querying for immediate children of a nodes is complicated i think it makes sense to also store the parent id in the table

1049748
decrement	increment
this is more complex than just increment all the indexes to make room for the insert or decrement for removal but it has the potential to affect far fewer nodess only decendenants of the parent of the insert removed nodes

1049784
command-prompt	cmd
i m trying to use devenv to building project and it runs just fine .when i types it in command-prompt like devenv a.sln building debug|win32 - but .when i use a python to run it using where cmd is the same line as above it show nothing

1049785
arrays	loops	decimal	hex
you could then store the results in a character arrays and loops through the arrays and compare the characters to their corrosponding hex or decimal value on the ascii charts

1049803

i m wondering if anyone else has gone through a similar upgrade experience and can shared what gotchas pitfalls there are what has to change in my code what is not backwards compatible between the two versioning

1049872
constructor	object
you re trying to call a constructor on an object that is already construct

1049880
subtract	add
the circuit to add and subtract using sign magnitude will be very complex

1049880
subtraction	addition
you can store negative numbers you get rid of the two zero problem but addition and subtraction remains difficult

1049897
any	set
in any case they are there .so you could set styles on all of them but i don t think it would be much clever

1049898
ruby	php
in that case the flash object communication directly with fms it makes no difference if your web .app is asp.net php ruby etc

1049903
any	set
the component set is very easy to work with and supports numerous visual enhancements which in my opinion give a better feel to any application

1049918
flv	mp3
i should give the input as frame but in flv i will get the sorenson video and mp3 audio frame after doing some trivial string operations to remove the headers

1049922
attributes	properties
.when i create a new diagram and updates model from database the storegeneratedpattern attributes gets added to some primary key properties but not all of them

1049923

you need to restart them to get a copy of the new environment variables

1049926
selected	button
designer go to set datasource location dialog create the oledb connection in the lower panels selected an existing table in the top panels selected the matching oledb table hit the updates button

1049938
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
i need to implements a provider that works well with both oracle and sql-server and also maybe mysql because we are going to sell the product to clients who may have any one of these databases and the application should be able to communication with any of these data sources

1049953
cross-join	inner-join
the generator sql does a cross-join but as the id s are matched it acts like an inner-join but is there a better performing way to do this by actually using the join keyword in c#

here are the ways to use dbproviderfactory you can find more samples in web just use this classes instead of specified ones obtaining the dbproviderfactory create provider-independent data-access code with ado.net 2.0

1050003
sql-server	oracle
it already has hooks for oracle and sql-server and you can extends this into any other database quite easily

1050008
triggers	insert	any	set
however you can set up a triggers on the insert for the database to delete any rows older than thirty days .so you only delete rows as you add more not just for the sake of it

1050043
any	set
any user account that is an alias generics account or otherwise not directly tied to a real person has the primary ou ou set as their primary ou

1050043
contains	any
there is no grouping that contains only real people no indicator in any field that they are real people or not and making any changes to active-directory or any user-accounts is strictly forbidden

1050071
defined	declare
if each of those inner types declare tens of properties to defined behavior and look then a high level control like a button would end up having the size of a class with something in the ballpark of a hundred properties

1050080
wavefront	.obj
model use this wavefront .obj loader for .obj and mtl files exported directly from blender or max

1050080
bmp	png
textures use apple s own texture2d class from the samples bmp will work but i recommend png because of the platform optimizations

1050089
perl	php	python	php	python	perl
i can work with php but am looking for a project to start learning perl or python .so this could be good for me as well

1050089
python	perl
if perl or python can you briefly give high level implementation

1050107
macros	vba
you could easily write a macros in vba that was bound to a cmd in vs which switched to release-mode did your full rebuild and fired off any other publishing packaging required

1050113
.when	ready
google is notoriously shady about release planning of their product .so it will probably be .when it s ready

1050122
entity-framework	ado.net
by using entitykey and this is something that the ado.net team doesn t seem to understand we have to work around the structure imposed on us by entity-framework

1050123
substring	charindex
for splitting you could use charindex substring and other string manipulation functions

1050127
any	set
i ve got an empty google-code project set up for this already and hope to start porting the java source code next week with any luck

1050139
python	perl
python is generally considered to be easy to learn and easy to read whereas perl is often jokingly referred to as a write-only language

1050146
subclassing	superclass
as we know there is a relationship between a subclassing and its superclass is-a

1050150
csv	xml
if it s csv or xml then any language might do

1050150
csv	xml
parsing text csv_xs for csv or tab-separated or xml-twig for xml

1050150
dbix-class	dbi
insert dbi with your appropriate db drivers though there are higher level wrapper too such as dbix-class

1050163
profiling	trace
the clr profiling can give you stack trace you are looking for

1050169
configuration	environment
in an environment where there are many developers i think the best approach would be to automate this process .so that all one would have to do is change a versioning numbers in a configuration file

1050170
httpwebrequest	webclient
given that you generally communication with couchdb over rest and json i d imagine it wouldn t be too hard to use json.net and the normals webclient httpwebrequest classes to do it

1050172
fwrite	fopen
maybe in php using fopen fwrite functions but i certainly think that comes with a lot of overhead

1050177
basic	vba
edit for future reference please refer to microsoft s msdn section on visual basic for applications vba

1050179
.when	ready
then with mootools i changed their value just .when the whole .doc was loaded .so .when the containers becomes visible block it is ready as a whole to be skinned by the css images and everything include

1050200
pthreads	fork
i gather process grouping are transfer by fork from the pthreads definition of fork

1050212
buffering	streaming
.so if you want to streaming 214kbps music around 27kb s and have let s say 60ms of latency you re looking at 3.24 kilobytes and rounding off to a nice 4kb buffering will work very well for you on a wide range of systemd

1050216
environment	restart
if you change the environment variables by going to systemd properties- advanced- envronment variables then you will have to restart visual-studio to see the changes

1050216
environment	building
if you need to see the envronment variables that visual-studio is seeing you can at least for vs2005 2008 go to tools...- options...- project and solutions- vc++ project settings and set show environment in log to yes. this will printing out all the environment variables to the building log ctrl+click on the link in your building output

1050216
environment	building
you have to building to get this info but this is the best way i know of seeing the vs environment

1050216
environment	building
if you really need to change environment variables then run and are having a hard time debuggingging you can building your debugging exe and have a call to debuggingbreak somewhere near where you want to start debuggingging from

1050267
macros	basic
i had tried working out some visual basic code for a macros myself borrowing from different places and couldn t get anything to work

1050277
scala	java
the integration between scala and java is quite strong inorder to use such a libs you need to integrated in both directions call java code from your scala to do things like drawing to the screens and also implements java interfaces from your scala code to do things like responding to events

1050279
value	field
before dependency-properties having a value have a local value an animatable value an overridable value a styleable value a templatable value would required the declaration of multiple properties field dictionary entries as well as complex state+precedence management

1050279
dependency-properties	attached-properties
martin also mentions attached-properties but those were also available at least in designer before the advent of dependency-properties

1050308
python	perl
i have seen it in some interpreted-language and perl or python can t remember

1050312
callback	methods
same for a threadstart handler or a callback from an asynchronous methods

1050320
exception-handling	try-catch
use try-catch only if you want to use a custom exception-handling types

1050329
execution	exit
we could pass in a command-line parameter that would tell the program to exit immediately but would that be sufficient or would we need .net to load each assembly we ll be using during the normals execution of the application

1050344
contains	elements
html string cannot contains elements that are invalid within a div such as

1050381
uisegmentedcontrol	uitableview
how and where do i resort the uitableview whenever the uisegmentedcontrol selected segment changes

derived-class	base-class
further if the derived-class isn t careful and forgets to invoke base-class functionality things can quickly go awry

1050392
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
firefox opera google-chrome safari will all display basic svg fine but will run into quirks if advanced features are used as support is incomplete

1050421
selected	cell
edit other code sample had errors adjusting for multiple selected cell as in fullrowselect

1050424
hash	md5
you might consider using those value as text to generator an md5 hash or something similar

1050429
fogbugz	redmine	fogbugz	trac	redmine	trac
i think some formalized bug tracker trac redmine jira fogbugz etc. could help us

1050435
nsurlconnection	nsxmlparser
an alternative would be to use nsurlconnection and create a new nsxmlparser and re-parse the data each time some data comes in in the connection didreceivedata methods of your nsurlconnection s delegation

1050438
value	field
of course it s not guaranteed to be thread-safe but if you need that you can simply convert the automatic properties into a standards one with a backing variables and mark the field as volatile to insure the value is up-to-date at all time

1050454
signals	sigint
the exception-handling occurs because the viewmodel already has a signals handler put in-place for sigint

1050457
cvs	git
git subversion cvs used wikipedia links which explains each with more detail

1050461
stderr	stdout
i think the problem is this the program writes all of its output to stderr rather than stdout

1050461
stderr	stdout
.so to overcome this it seems like you have to redirect the output of your program unix2dos uses stderr to stdout

1050461
stderr	stdout
the 2 means redirect stderr and 1 means to stdout

1050501
redmine	trac
we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use

1050517
jquery	.post
jquery uses its .ajax methods to .post to another controllers methods cars colors list

1050517
callback	methods
the controllers methods prepares a list of carcolors and send it back via a jsonresult that the .ajax methods consumes in it s callback

1050528
python	c++	python	java
you could write it in c++ python java or anything

1050536
selected	cell
.when the user click on a row in the datagrid or uses the keyboard that row is selected but the specific cell they click on is also given its own special focus

1050557
value	field
in the proc i want to pull some value out of the xml as a bit but because the user-interface allows for a third state the bit value coming in from the xml can be null in which case i want to ignore any sql updates for that field

1050560
file-permissions	filesystems
i would like to maintain the file-permissions set .when extraction on a nix filesystems

1050575
selected	checkbox
the all divisions checkbox selected all the checkbox for that sport

1050597
value	field
these rows are devoid of any information including the three id field that required not null value to be entered into the database

1050660
margins	padding
in one design i built i created a two column layout that required margins and padding

1050660
firefox	safari
this made the page line up perfectly in firefox and safari but in ie the nav column was pushed over to the right too far

1050660
firefox	safari
the placement of this line of css is important if my page is still to look good in firefox and safari

1050660
firefox	safari
firefox and safari will read that line and then it will be overrides by the body div#nav selector lower in the document

1050660
firefox	safari
.when ie 7 comes along it will act like firefox and safari

1050665
arrays	map
if you stored the results in an arrays it might be called map

1050669
arrays	map
essentially load the datapoint into a javascript arrays plot them on the map and then populate your html with the arrays information

1050669
arrays	map
this link is a page i recently wrote that does the above and also dynamically repopulates the arrays from the db as the user drag the map hardly any css at present either

1050672
jcifs	ntlm	platform	lgpl
jcifs free lgpl - plug-compatible support for lm ntlm not ntlm v2 on all java platform

1050672
jcifs	ntlm
if you can change the windows machine to an ntlm configuration level less that 4 to not required ntlm v2 and make sure the network security minimum session security for ntlm ssp based including secure rpc servers is not set to required ntlm v2 then use either the jakarta http client if you don t care about plug compatibility or the jcifs http client if you do

1050672
jcifs	ntlm
also if you are accessing your httpserver through a proxy that supports only oem encoding for ntlm then you cannot use the jakarta http client is this also true of jcifs

1050673
decimal	hex
it s like numbers - int aren t stored in hex or decimal they re just int

1050673
decimal	hex
you can format them in hex or decimal but the value itself is just a number.

problem i m having .when button click you see comments load original blogload plus blogs and comments trying to get it to load blog comment selected only

1050692
vcalendar	vcard
i want to be able to read vcard and vcalendar data using .net i have something which does this and have looked at the specifications

1050692
vcalendar	vcard
these are both stored as plain text filename.ics for vcalendar and filename.vcf for vcard

1050695
complement	addition
the nice thing about ten s complement is that addition just works

1050714
attributes	properties
however because of the nature of the attributes it would be impossible to determine the correct attributes parameter per ef properties

1050722
protected-mode	real-mode
there is an option in the header of a bzimage format kernel file that specifies the address of real-mode code to execute before the protected-mode code starts

margins	padding
you al.so have the option to incorporate reset capabilities .so that all browsers are set to a common layout with regard to fonts padding margins etc

1050761
contains	set
my project contains a large numbers of classes with properties whose backing field is marked readonly as they are only set at construction

1050794
radiobuttonlist	gridview
the gridview contains a templatefield which contains a radiobuttonlist with listitems defined inline

1050800
put	get
if you re developing some kind of your own arrays abstraction you can get o 1 if you store smallest added value in additional attributes and compare it every time a new item is put into arrays

1050810
player	movie
perhaps you could see if the iphone filesystems would support a symbolic or hard link back to the original file in the re.source directory .so you could feed the movie player different named

1050815
revision	svn	revision	updates
that scripting al.so updates a single file with the current svn revision numbers which we then show on the development site .so everyone knows what s running and .when it was most recently updates

1050825
attributes	properties
xelement does not have similar properties but you can add attributes xsi nil by yourself and test against it in the stored proc

1050826
g++	gcc
however i use gcc g++ for all of my project

1050829
revision	svn
the accepted answer to this question suggests using an svn revision numbers as part of the versioning numbers .when building a release

1050834
msbuild	nant

1050900
silverlight	wpf
warning silverlight wpf n00b

1050900
silverlight	wpf
it just became apparent that brushes are not tile-able in silverlight unlike wpf

1050903
any	set
japplet and jframe both extends containers .so you just set the layout and add the components like you would in any other swing gui

1050917
required	checked
from an implementsation perspective it would be the best solution to implements the checked as far down stack as possible because there is the lowest numbers of functions that required protection hence the lowest numbers of things to mess up and all user input have to pass-through the protected layer

1050938
xlib	x11
if you don t use the kde framework but are still using x11 you can use the xlib api to call xgrabkey on the root windows

1050944

i have seen a lot of people put a broad try-catch from the beginning to the end of every methods and catch the general exception-handling

1051004
put	get
i have read .so many articles describing that how to send get .post trace options request but i still haven t found any sample code which successfully performs put and delete request

1051013
jquery	.post
the page have a jquery ajax load called by the onchange of a dropdownlistfor if i disable the onchange the .post works

1051016
getter	setter
use getter and setter to set the variables and make the default-constructor private

1051020
constructor	object
if you want the same object but for its internal value to be different which is the only way it s still a singleton then you don t need to care about the constructor at all

1051020
factory-pattern	singleton
if you want getinstance 2 and getinstance 5 to return different object on the other hand you re not using the singleton pattern you re using the factory-pattern

1051031
checkbox	listbox
the same applies to the checkbox on the listbox listview

1051035
buffering	streaming
it seems to just playback the data that was in the buffering .when imediacontrol pause was called instead of re-syncing with the live streaming

1051043
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
it could be implements by using a synchronized hashmap or concurrenthashmap map a parameter an int for an example to your singleton parameterizable class

1051047
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup
what i have tried .so far is adding stuff to the main form s mousedown mouseup and mousemove events .sort of looks .something like what this guy show but they aren t getting called breakpoints in them don t get hit

1051049
arrays	map
you can also implements arrays s foreach filtering map any every etc

1051075
contains	set
if all checkbox are set the arrays will then be filled with strings contains the value of different checkbox

1051075
contains	set
the boolean control columns where i set their rendering field to true false according to what the checkbox arrays contains

1051075
variables	boolean
is there a way for me to use the value from to set the correct boolean variables or can i turn this into a map maybe and use the jsf el to checked if key exists in the map

1051079
managed-code	native-code
you should be careful if you are doing anything with native-code whether it be unsafe managed-code or interop pinvoke but if all of your code is managed you shouldn t have any problems

1051080
32-bit	64bit
if it doesn t rely on a 32-bit external libs com component it ll work perfectly as a 64bit process and will leverage its benefits large address spaces x64 instruction set ...

1051080
32-bit	x86
if it relies on 32-bit stuff most of the time you can still run it as a 32-bit application by setting the target-platform to x86

1051084
32-bit	64bit
most 64bit os s are able to handle 32-bit apps without problems

1051084
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
this is why you see a program files x86 folder on your 64bit os to handle a lot of your old 32-bit apps

1051086
64bit	x86
most .net applications should work unmodified in 64bit if they target x86 instead of any cpu which is the vs.net default

1051088
exception-handling	try-catch
but i would use a try-catch around sections of code that i expected to fail opening a file and where i wanted to add additional information to the exception-handling to be logged higher up the chaining

1051089
constructor	object
right now my pointlist object has one constructor

1051097
dependency-injection	singleton
i d suggest using dependency-injection to control the composition of your application instead of structural patterns such as factory and singleton

1051110
scala	java
if you re looking to avoid dealing with having java source files in your scala project just translation the java code into scala

1051111

1051441
constructor	object	copy-constructor	temporary	copy-constructor	rvalue	copy-constructor	constructor	temporary	rvalue
if a_factory_func returns an a object then they are equivalent they both call the copy-constructor for a otherwise the first versioning creates an rvalue of types a from an available conversioning operators for the return-types of a_factory_func or appropriate a constructor and then call the copy-constructor to construct a1 from this temporary

1051441
copy-constructor	temporary
for c2 it depends on whether there is a user supplied copy-constructor and whether that appropriately initializer those members but the members of the temporary will all be initializer zero-initializer if not otherwise explicit initializer

1051458
updating	updates
this would involve only updating one .jar file on the server if for example we need to updates the icefaces .jar files to a new versioning

1051460
pixels	line
but instead of drawing any line or turning on any pixels count the pixels between the line

1051460
pixels	line
i think that inorder to count the columns of pixels you will need to determine whether m lies above or below the line lr and of course special cases will arise .when two points have the same x or y co-ordinate

1051463
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade my browser to safari 4 and find that our website is having some major issues specific to that browser versioning

1051468
temporary	copy
the second copy initializer value-initialization a temporary and then copies that value into c2 read 5.2.3 2 and 8.6 14

1051468
any	set
as you see copy initialization is in some way a part of direct initialization with regard to possible implicit-conversion while direct initialization has all constructor available to call and in addition can do any implicit-conversion it needs to match up arguments types copy initialization can just set up one implicit-conversion sequences

1051529
firefox	safari
the second alert in firefox will be undefined but in ie and safari it is object

1051532
value	field
then the only time it fails is .when you try to compare against intcode field it almost seems like it is failing .when it tries to put the non-numeric value on the left side of the intcode 2 comparison because this is the only time it will need to pick up every single value in the code field

timers on their own threads wont have to wait for the other timer to exit before they can run because of this like anything multithreading you will need to consider locking any reources which multiple timers use and there is the possibility of race conditional

1051924
subtract	time
in the short term you can charge the team x numbers of units points of work to fix the defects look at your past iterator and if it takes x numbers of hours per iterator to clean up the small bugs subtract that time from your team s capacity. longer term focus on the root cause and improve your team s engineering practices

page-fault	kernel
if you did allow another thread to execute which you imply in your question that it would be easy to do you wouldn t be able to let it do anything - if it caused a page-fault you d have to use service in the kernel that are unusable while the interrupt is being serviced see below for why

1053579
python	c++	bison	yacc
and 3. i can t suggest much beyond what you already found i mostly use python and pyparsing and could comment from experience on many python-centered parsing frameworks but for c++ i mostly use good old yacc or bison anyway and my old gnarled copy of the dragon book -- not the latest edition actually -- is all i keep at my side for the purpose...

processor	cpu
as another answer said this is a very easy operation to parallelise - it should improve the speed nearly linearly with cpu count 2 processor twice as fast etc apart from the caching misses etc.

1053724
constructor	object
but to actually answer your question yes the object and arrays constructor are also invoked for literals creations

1053741

32-bit	64bit
32-bit and 64bit jvms

1053846
data-structures	dictionary
i don t know why ms didn t create generics sets or .so instead of dictionary because this would allow implements such data-structures where the key is part of the data

1053846
gethashcode	equals
also to continue with the small rant i wonder why they did not add the notion of declarative immutable typess and make this a possible generics types constraint because this would allow to make sure a key does not change its hashcode during runtime which can happen currently if one implements gethashcode and equals on some mutable object

1053858
selected	button
then in the database view on the right selected the sql tab and copy-paste the sql code in and click the go button

1053933
facade	dao
but the twisted is that we selectively expose methods on the dao through a facade and forwarding only those we absolutely must

1053945
any	set
now that might seem expensive but if the alternative .when you checked a new set of 10 against the existing 10000 indidvidually is that you calculate 252 sets of 5 and see if any of them are in the set then it has to be better

1053963
any	set
other than that is there any way i can set the bounds of the superlayer to stop .when it reaches the bounds of it or i have to do that manually on touchesmoved

1054062
contains	any
absolutely wrong function __import__ like every other function -- and-operator for that matter bind no named in the scoping of caller code contains it -- any thingie that bind named in the caller s scoping must be a statement just like assignment def and call

1054062
scheme	lisp
modern variants of lisp from scheme onwards don t use dynamic scoping a misfeature that was sadly highly visible usually manifesting as hard-to-understand bugs in their code to beginners basically as soon as they started writing functions in lisp 1.5 i once was a beginner in that and can testify to how badly it bit me

1054365
directdraw	gdi
i found that setting the gdi palette using create selectpalette before setting the directdraw palette using idirectdrawpalette setentries would restore the palette after it became corrupt wm_palettechanged handler

1054380
ubuntu	osx
i m on osx but would also be interested in doing this on an ubuntu box and windows-xp

1054381
local-variables	class-members
you can also use thread_local with static .when declaring class-members or local-variables in a function

1054386
getter	setter
public members don t required a getter and a setter .so you wouldn t have to worry about that.

1054386
extends	final
as a final bonus extends the class becomes easier because you don t have to redeclare all the field in their entirety if you want to overrides the properties

1054394
implements	abstract
i ve also implements my custom aes encryption decryption overrides the abstract encryptpassword decryptpassword of the membership-provider

1054413

1054440
textbox	button
i want to allow users to add textbox elements using javascript by click the add button

1054453
any	set
if you have your assembly info set to automatically generator any versioning numbers 1.0

1054453
versioning	upgrade
you can al.so set a setting of needsupgrading to true by default and set it to false after performing an upgrade .so that end users who are not changing versioning numbers every time the .app is started will not be upgrading all the time

1054464
bash	zsh
maybe the problem with job control had to do with some bug in zsh that doesn t even exist in bash and maybe it is no longer relevant in zsh either

1054480
python	php	python	java
programming language php python java .

1054483
linux	unix
quantum gis â qgis is a user friendly open source gis that runs on linux unix mac os x and windows

1054484
hash	md5
for example take the md5 hash of the username then treat the last 8 bytes of that as a long

1054488
.when	ready
.when it comes to enterprise ready i m not sure how much more ready a stack using pylons with sqlalchemy can be in the python world

1054488
pylons	django
pylons definitely has a large enough community to sustain itself especially as its rather lean and compact codebase don t pick up nearly as many bugs as the kitchen sink frameworks of zope django

1054502
administration	account
i think this is no longer a problem today but i remember back on good old nt 4 a freind of mine managed to deny all access to a folder including the administration account

1054504
activerecord	datamapper
you might want to look at using datamapper or sequel for your orm if you re finding that activerecord lacks the expressiveness you need for complex queries

1054510
configuration	environment
copy your configuration over to the production.rb environment file

1054512
javascript	dom
i would like to abbreviate the appendchild methods as well since that s such a common javascript methods but ie also complains if you try and monkey-patch the dom by creating a .ac methods

1054523
if-statement	arrays
the ideal situation would be to end up with an arrays or 3 variables that i could test with a basic if-statement

1054526
mapserver	mapnik
i know mapserver works but it is very likely geoserver and mapbuilder and even mapnik could work depending on the specifics

1054530
bmp	png
a libs that converts a bmp to png and only has a save file option - no in memory function

1054532
openlayers	mapserver
afaik the best choice for a web-applications is to prepare your data with gvsig hosts your data into postgresql postgis publishing a wms wfs service s with mapserver and then show your data using openlayers

1054538
16-bit	8bit
of course the non-portable assumption is that char is 8bit and short is 16-bit

1054538
32-bit	16-bit
if that is the case it would probably be better to read a 32-bit value starting at a 16-bit boundary and adjust the shifts and masks accordingly

1054546
value	field
how do i assign initial value to field inside a modelform

1054567
postback	ajax
what you could do is add code to do an ajax postback every x seconds 30 seconds let s say with an ajax timer

1054577
spaces	output
while looping to printing them out add a line break and some spaces in between them to create the output look

1054578
web-applications	scalability
habits of highly scalability web-applications

1054579
stderr	stdout
by refering to stdin stdout and stderr streaming

1054584
implements	final
the advantage of this approach is that it s easy to implements but the disadvantage is that memory usage can be unpredicatable if you don t know how large the final file will be

1054595
directory	folder
if you delete a folder extension from the extensions directory it has the same effect as uninstaller it

1054605
binary-tree	nodes
i have a binary-tree where each nodes can have a value

1054614
dictionary	arrays
json is very easy to work with for sending data in arrays and key-value dictionary

1054639
python	perl
note at the moment this is in a sql-server database but i m open to ideas utilizing c# perl or python

1054655
asp.net-mvc	wcf
but for your asp.net-mvc site you could access wss via web-services wcf

1054657
32-bit	64bit
intel s 32-bit processor such as pentium have 64bit wide data bus and therefore fetch 8 bytes per access

1054667
32-bit	64bit
shorts should be on even addresses 32-bit on 4-byte addresses and 64bit on 8-byte addresses

1054672
python	perl	python	java	haskell	perl	haskell	python
languages such as c# vb haskell eiffel perl python java etc

1054674
selected	checkbox
i am trying to get all repeater s selected checkbox of repeater s item just before page movement paginator and store them in some place

1054681
frame	width
the frame width is still narrowed to fit to the rightmost letter

1054681
sizetofit	subviews
if your labels is include in a nib or storyboard as a subviews of the view of a viewcontroller that uses autolayout then putting your sizetofit call into viewdidload won t work because autolayout sizes and positioning the subviewss after viewdidload is called and will immediately undo the effects of your sizetofit call

1054681
frame	width	height	frame
this uses the nsstring methods sizewithfont constrainedtosize linebreakmode to calculate the frame height needed to fit a string then sets the origin and width

1054692
base-class	inherited
is it possible to tell proxy object to inherited attributes on its base-class proxy class and attributes on properities of base-class

1054696
display	width
on a high level i would likely do this by putting an empty display block elements with a colored background or maybe an image on the page with a width of zero then run periodic ajax callback to the server to get progress updates and increase the elements s width accordingly

1054700
scheme	lisp
emacs lisp - scheme or cl didn t have enough performance at that time

1054710
triggers	insert
you could use an instead of insert triggers

1054711
triggers	insert
maybe you could use a triggers to verify that the insert can be done the pk don t exist

1054712
moss	wss
in wss 3.0 and moss 2007 the look-and-feel is controlled through master pages

1054712
moss	wss
also there is a good blog entry over on msdn by joel oleson that describe modifying master pages and themes in wss and moss

1054716
triggers	insert
you could create a new table with the same schema as commreceipt and place an instead of triggers on that table stripping the primary key and insert into commreceipt

1054724
updating	updates
another tip about delphi updating that confused me for a while .when installing help updates 2 i got kind of a pop-up under

1054728
perl	php
you ll also need to send extra whitespace inorder for browsers to updates the page find an equivalent of php s fflush in perl

1054743
debugging	trace
it s more suitable for debugging or even trace

1054748
ref	out
judging from the error messages i figured this must have something to do with the second parameter ref aninterface and that i could ignore this for the second pass which turned out to be true

1054748
defined	declare
the parameter in question is declare and defined thus

1054760
linux	unix
can i somehow execute this on linux unix

1054766
value	field
the qty and rate field have a classname of decimal and .when they leave focus it will updates the line total as per below but i need to restrict it to only updates the total of the current line which it doesn t but input the total value of all line with the sum of the first entry

1054779
32-bit	64bit
an int32 should be aligned on a 32-bit boundary an int64 on a 64bit boundary and .so on

1054779
32-bit	64bit
32-bit alignment of 32-bit-wide data ensures that it won t cross a 64bit boundary

1054782
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php	haskell	python
php asp jsp ruby python web apps haskell is starting to be considered here too thanks reddit

1054782

haskell	scala
scala haskell couldn t find any one clear thing they both seem pretty general i use neither

1054787
required	checked
the following checked is required if by run my scripting you mean anything else then double-clicking the .vbs file

1054789
bmp	png
it is certianly possible to find a png - bmp converter that can work in memory

1054840
priority-queue	heap
this task is quite possible to complete within roughly o n time n being the length of the list by using a heap structure specifically a priority-queue based on a fibonacci heap which gives o 1 insert time and o log n removal time

1054840
priority-queue	queue
by simply looping over the list and adding each item to the priority-queue of size m you can effectively create a queue of each of the items in the list in o n time or possibly fewer using some optimisations though i m not sure this is exceedingly helpful

1054852
contains	any
the analysis will contains indexing recommendations if there are any improvements to be made with additional indexes

1054855
authentication	login
i need to use windows messenger login to get users authentication and get their contact details ..display named etc

1054860
base-class	inherited
i ve been using this inherit-based approach where every unit inherited from vector4 until now but this causes some problems because .when i for example call add force1 force2 i get the base-class vector4 back instead of a force3d

1054885
flash-cs3	flash-cs4
since i own the older flash-cs3 i was wondering if i could use the older html files with the newer ide by changing some xml file within the flash-cs4 directory on my c drive

1054914
contains	set
flash-cs4 contains the entire standards set of documentation

1054919
histogram	plot
i d like to fit a distribution curve to my data and plot it on top of a histogram of the data

1054924
registration	login
i am using facebooker with ruby-on-rails and .when i login via facebook connect for a new user registration i get a session expired .when i retrieve details like first_name etc.

1054991
delphi	c++
in my case to answer your question i had to decide to either learn c++ or delphi 12 years ago

1054991
delphi	c++
comparing object-oriented features of delphi c++ c# and java

1054995
keyboard	mouse
between the user and the user-interface the user-interface events mouse and keyboard

1054996
scala	java
there s been some discussion about unifying scala and java in 2.8 by just using java.util.iterator

1054996
scala	java
on the downside java s iterator has a remove methods which makes no sense for scala s immutable collections

1055015
ruby-on-rails	django
all the technical bits for this already exist on the the iphone no third-party libs needed and should be easy to implements on a server with ruby-on-rails or django

1055022
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
.when using a uiviewcontroller the normals way pushing it on a uinavigationcontroller it adjusts its view s frame

1055025
firefox	opera
neither javascript itself or any webbrowser ie firefox opera ... are xquery capable or have support built-in

1055026
python	perl
the easiest way to do this would be to use a programming language like perl or python but you have already stated that is not an option although i find it odd that perl isn t already on the machine

1055038
python	ruby
both ruby and python have the ability of calling the debugger from code using the ruby-debug gem or the pdb module

1055039
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
but you d be better off to use the uiviewcontroller and push this on the uinavigationcontroller

1055053
python	perl	temporary	copy
to modify the file in situ you either need to use perl or python or a similar language or you capture the output in a temporary file which you copy over the original once the cmd has completed

1055073
children	nodes
if your nodess link to their parent and the children of a nodes will always be enumerated in the same order you can trace your step without having to save them

1055116
innodb	myisam
the standards suggestion of bumping key_buffer or innodb_buffer_pool for myisam and innodb respectively still applies

1055145
beautifulsoup	elementtree	beautifulsoup	lxml	elementtree	lxml
beautifulsoup lxml and other python libs elementtree etc. make dealing with xml more easy

1055149
text-align	display
you could set the s to be display inline then set text-align centering on the

1055155
worksheet	excel
way that excel worksheet

1055159
entity-relationship	diagram
is thentity-relationshipe a program that conventity-relationshipts a sql-sentity-relationshipventity-relationship database diagram to entity-relationship model or create entity-relationship model of a database from sql-sentity-relationshipventity-relationship sentity-relationshipventity-relationship

1055183
youtube	vimeo
should we upload the video to youtube or vimeo and embed

1055185
constructor	object
f# actually has some very nice construct for creating event-driven user-interface applications such as first class events object expression calling properties setter from a constructor

1055191
youtube	vimeo
upload to a service like youtube blip.tv or vimeo is good but you ll have to settle for them tossing in related videos or other ads on your content and you ll be forced to stick with their player branding

1055193
contains	elements
this resultset contains one elements now is then passed to the next call merger

1055206
windows-xp	windows-ce
how to put some folder as path in the windows-ce more specifically an hpc 2000 jornada 720 put in the path like in windows-xp or 2000 or vista that you only run like javac or ruby in the cmd and the program runs

1055212
firefox	safari
this uses the video tag if it s supported but as firefox and safari both support different formats ogg and mp4 you need to have a couple of different versioning of the video files

1055212
google-chrome	opera
this works on every browser from ie6 to the iphone and from google-chrome to opera including everything in between

1055217
boost	stl
i am unsure about what boost has but some stl implementation like sgi have hash_map

1055219
firefox	safari
ie will use an object-tag generally with an id and firefox safari etc will use the embed tag and since you aren t supposed to be the same id on two elements people generally use the named attributes instead of an id attributes on the embed tag

1055226
header-only	boost	header-only	bjam
the unordered collections libs is header-only meaning you don t have to pull in boost s bjam build-process and install

1055243
contains	any
unless these hashmap are vastly different from any of the hashing algorithms i was bought up on there must always exist a dataset that contains collision

1055251
tortoisesvn	smartsvn
you can use any of the free user-interface applications to access the source control repositories such as tortoisesvn smartsvn etc..

1055272
python	java	default-value	default
if you express no such constraints then an attributes that s missing will either have a default-value supplied by your code or libs or else a default default which i believe is usually null in java or none in python

1055272
python	java
note that different versioning of the .app may use different runtime .some may be java and others may be python and the different runtime will still use the same datastore .so the java vs python distinction is not crucial here

1055272
compatibility	legacy
in general terms i would not worry about adding optional attributess ones which may legitimately be missing null none or have an explicit default in those cases .so that entities written by the older versioning are still correctly readable but other kinds of changes making a previously missing or optional attributes be mandatory instead adding other constraints etc may required a form of database-migration maybe via the secure data connector or application level hacks for legacy compatibility if a migration is just unfeasible

1055287
shadowbox	lightbox	shadowbox	jquery	lightbox	jquery
i d recommend looking into jquery as there are a numbers of shadowbox lightbox plugins for it

1055296
treeview	listview
it is also very simple to building an editor in visual-studio for the datamodel by having a treeview or listview display each item object in the datamodel and use the propertyeditor to edit the properties of the selected object

1055296
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
use openfiledialog and savefiledialog to let the user selected the xml file and xmlserializer to load and save ur datamodel

1055315
version-control	git
i recommend redmine for issue tracking project-management and git for version-control

1055315
cvs	git	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
redmine supports most scm s like cvs subversion git darcs mercurial and bazaar

1055315
cvs	git	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	darcs	svn
scm integration svn cvs git mercurial bazaar and darcs

1055315
bitnami	redmine
for extremely easy installation redmine can be install using bitnami available for windows mac and linux

1055325
for-loop	arrays
i know for a fact ran the query directly on the server with some sample value from the file that the data is in the database but .when i var_dump the s each time the for-loop runs i just get an empty arrays

1055328
linux	osx
use flex because 98 percent people has flash plugins install + it runs on windows linux osx

1055334
tcsh	zsh	tcsh	bash	bash	zsh
i would say that this is because it is useful to learn some basic bash zsh tcsh whatever pipe loops redirection of streaming ...

1055334
python	perl
shell languages are notoriously painful to use in many situations that would be easily tackled with perl or python which are arguably more powerful fewer line and simpler code for the same result

1055353
lookup	any
it s also been explained that strictly speaking it s possible to construct input that required o n lookup for any deterministic hash-function

1055358
value	field
then if you insert a single column value it will overwrite the score field and use the primary key serial sequences to generator a value for the other column

1055367
firefox	safari
surprisingly it works with safari 4 but it doesn t work with firefox with safari 3 the background is not transparency

1055391
memcached	apc
if you re married to the idea of increment filenames you ll probably want to use some sort of shared datastore for holding your sequences numbers like mysql memcached or apc

1055409
value	field
i have a content-type with a date field which can have multiple value

1055414
javascript	dom
add a to your code somewhere in the footer you can also append this via javascript if you don t want your dom getting cluttered

1055441
dictionary	map
dictionary are supposed to map key to value and don t care about other value in the dictionary

1055454
value	field
subqueries can only return one value .so we must combine candy and preferences factors into one field

1055469
calloc	malloc
if you call calloc malloc new etc

1055470
any	set
is there any way to set this up

1055471
double	int
ability to distinguish between int double etc and to ignore text if necessary

1055488
email-validation	validation
since you re not building an sql query or anything here the only relevant validation that i can see for those input is an email-validation for _post email and maybe an alphanumeric filtering on the other field if you really want to limit the scoping of what the messages can contains

1055494
required	checked
i setup my website to required unique email-addresses no two users can have the same email-address but i realized that this could allow someone to checked if a person is registered on my website by attempting to signup with that email

1055518
push	pull
in java filtering servlet jsp include and forwarding use same request object .so for example you can push an object in a servlet and pull it in a jsp

1055523
value	field
in your form jsp you d use the usebean tag and your form field value would get their value from the bean

1055570
vb.net	vb6
our clonedr clone detection does this for java c# c++ cobol vb.net vb6 fortran and a variety

1055573
arrays	loops
then you can simply loops over the resulting arrays and call your validation s validation chaining

1055602
data-members	private
not all private methods should be move to non-member non-friend function but those that do not need access to your private data-members should be

1055602
data-members	private
as encapsulation is proportionnal to the amount of code you would break by modifying your methods having a private member-function even though it does not required access to data-members

1055609
protected	public
.when i write my code i really only put public and protected functions into classes

1055618
versioning	upgrade
reinstall jdk or upgrade to newer versioning

1055618
versioning	upgrade
reinstall netbeans or upgrade to newer versioning

1055631
constructor	private
make the static constructor save the logging field to a private variables

1055639
fflush	stdout
if you want to output characters one at a time you will need to call ffflush stdout explicit to fflush the output buffering

1055643
ubuntu	linux
under windows i don t see any problems but .when starting the application under linux ubuntu 8.10 it stops with the following error messages

1055645
packets	ping
if packets are being dropped between the source and destination ping will tell you

1055645
ftp-server	proftpd
use a different ftp daemons on the ftp-server such as proftpd as a windows service

1055650
profiling	trace
i did a numbers of trace in sql profiling and all i can tell is that the failure is a types 16 error on master

1055659
alt	src
img src info.png alt info icons span

1055701
javascript	dom
it sounds like you need to have the javascript create the dom sections rather than just changing css styles

1055710
sql-server	mysql
i have to design a data-access-layer with .net that probably will use more than one database management systemd mysql and sql-server with the same relational design

1055718
return-value	arguments
nsmethodssignature recording types information for the arguments and return-value of a methods but doesn t contains the selector itself

1055729
sql-server	mysql
it can generator code for both mysql and sql-server

1055738
exception-handling	try-catch
note that it is preferable to handle appdomain.unexpectedexception-handling and call environment.failfast instead of having a top-level try-catch exception-handling x because with the latter the original cause of the problem will probably be obscured by further exception-handling-handling

1055738
exception-handling	try-catch
you should never catch an exception-handling that indicates an invalid program state that you don t know how to handle - even in a top level main function try-catch block

1055742
invalidoperationexception	nullreferenceexception
if i forget to insert some value into a configuration before calling a methods i want an invalidoperationexception with a messages detailing my error not a keynotfoundexception nullreferenceexception

1055751
floating	margins
the margins is being swallowed under the floating elements

1055755
xsd	xml
it does a nice job of import and even validation the xml data against the schema xsd file but .when i export it drops the xmlns xlmns xsi and xsi schemalocation attributes from the root elements

1055760
children	tree
this can occasionally be useful if you d display a count in a treeview which should include the numbers of children to be found further down in the tree

1055769
selected	button
if you required users to copy content i d recommend dropping that content in a textarea and allowing them to selected copy by click a button

1055775
.when	ready
you can but they must be called within the scoping of the ready methods otherwise they lose scoping .when the ready methods exit

1055796
pointers	stack
have you considered using a stack data structure to recording jump points the location of the instruction pointers

1055796
pointers	stack
.so basically every time you encounter a you push the current location of the instruction pointers on this stack

1055796
pointers	stack
whenever you encounter a you reset the instruction pointers to the value that s currently on the top of stack

1055796
while-loop	loops
i just went over the code again and i realized there was a bug in the while-loop that would skip parsing loops if the value of the pointers is 0

1055798
pointers	stack
if pointers 0 pop the off of stack and proceed goto step 1

1055802
user-controls	ascx
what i would like to know is how you commonly organise asp.net applications in terms of placement of pages aspx user-controls ascx server controls and other support classes and utility functions etc

1055802
user-controls	ascx
what i would like to have is to have the pages aspx user-controls ascx and handler ashx basically as dummy placeholder sitting in the directory-structure organized from the logically according to the points of view of the outside visitor while the actual codepages user-controls implementation serve control and utility classes should be placed in s different folder structured into logical namespaces organized by the modules or features of the application

1055802
subclassing	inherited
i leave this class be no code will go there but create a subclassing say in myapp.somenamespace.somesubnamespace.mypage inherited from myapp.mypage

1055820
background-color	display
i have a user-controls with a triggers set to display a background-color change on itself .when ismouseover is true

1055829
superscript	subscript
the possibility to make text superscript or subscript is built-in in the richtextbox see this msdn article

1055829
superscript	subscript
edit if i understand correctly you don t need just subscript and superscript capabilities but a full equation editor

1055834
dependency-injection	inject
more specifically i would always recommend that you hide your data-access-layer behind an interface and use dependency-injection to inject a particular data-access component into your domain logic at runtime

1055834
entity-framework	data-access
on the technology side i would recommend microsoft s entity-framework since your data-access needs seem to be constrained to relational databases

you can install both 32-bit and 64bit versioning side-by-side though

1057773
google-chrome	safari
this wonâ t count as a valid answer because i donâ t know how to actually fix that but the problem is that most browsers besides safari and google-chrome perhaps load javascripting sequentially because itâ s necessary to wait for the previous scripting to finish execution as it may change the document

assuming that set s1 contains the same contents in the first and second examples the end results should come out to be the same

1058224
contains	set
construct a new set contains the

1058252
any	set
however inorder for this to work httpwebrequest needs to attach the credentials on the first request however httpwebrequest will not send credentials on the first request and will wait for a 401 before sending any credentials even if preauthenticate is set to true with preauthenticate it will send credentials for all subsequent request

linked-list	tree
if you had the degenerate case where the width was 1 then the tree becomes a linked-list and the spaces requirements are o n

1058461
virtual-machine	virtualization
virtualization allows us to replace the 50-60 physical machines that we need to maintain for testing and problem reproduction with 2-3 virtual servers - it takes around 10 miniutes to make a copy of a vhd templates we have and create a new virtual-machine and as long as you allocate 1-2gb of ram the performance is comparable to that of a slow physical machine

1058462
sql-server	oracle
what is the sql-server equivalent to oracle s virtual private database vpd

1059162
while-loop	loops
if the nesting variables is 0 then we know that the end of loops has been encountered .so seeking the end of loops in the while-loop is terminate by execution a break statement

1059453
class-design	base-class
typically situations like this can often be handled by rethinking reworking the class-design .so that there is a single base-class or interface which defined a and instead of creating one concrete class with 2 base-classes create one of two specific concrete classes derived from a single base-class

this code would essentially show the list bind a click handler that finds the next list elements relative to the one being click on if it finds one it hide itself and show that one and then outside the click we show the first one to get things started

1059523
children	nodes
.when you call find it searches the children of these three nodes for b tags

1059523

1059636
margins	padding
start by clearing all of the default padding and margins in your css file using

1059636
margins	padding
then you ll have to adjust your code accordingly as every browser adds its own padding and margins to all attributes

1059636
firefox	safari
once you get it to the points where you re happy with it in firefox and safari use conditional-statements to pull in the appropriate ie stylesheet

i have an object that i initializer - it s quite nifty as it also extends a superclass and does some stuff in the constructor - in fact all the vital parameters and methods call are handled in the constructor

1062517
base-class	inherited
then other classes can inherited from the base-class and change the interface s methods implementation

mailformatter class then reads via mimemessages session inputstream constructor and parsing the messages object one by one and then stores the xml content in another location which will be read by mobileresponderservlet and sent to mobile

1063055
attributes	properties
if not having the attributes is not an error conditional the exception-handling variant has a problem it would catch al.so attributeserrors that might come internally .when accessing obj.attributes for instances because attributes is a properties .so that accessing it call .some code

1063066
unmanaged	c++-cli
to convert a systemd string ot lpcwstr in c++-cli you can you use the marshalling stringtohglobalansi function to convert managed strings to unmanaged strings

it s redundant as you can add the view directly without assign it to a uiview first - plus it s incorrect as it references the mynavigationcontroller and not navigationcontroller

1063415
expression	evaluation
if you re already evaluation the expression maybe you d like to simplify the formula if possible

1063426
contains	elements
your insert code then needs to iterate over that arrays creating a new insert for each elements it contains unless as it seems you want all those options to be concatenation into a single row s field

1063432
children	nodes
each nodes represents a task that can be done 1 not done 0 or have children tasks

1063432
children	nodes	children	tree
at the moment i walk the tree from the leaves on and each nodes is calculated based on the percentage of completeness of the children

1063432
children	nodes
now more children are added to 1.2 that is no more a leaf but becomes a nodes

1063450
arrays	loops
you can then loops over the arrays like

1063486
value	field
null happens to work since there is no field or variables with the named null and formula is forgiving and makes the missing value 0

1063486
value	field
the trick here you compute the value that the field isnotyet7daysold should have for the selecteded document that would be the changed ones for the onchange agent or all on the scheduling agent and then selected to change only those where the result doesn t match

1063486
value	field
if you now add a hidden computed-when-composed field isnotyet7daysold with true as field value you capture all your document reliably

1063488
children	nodes
i think the percentage of each nodes is the average value of it s children not sub-children percentage

1063493
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

1063551
value	field
to this simply put in a function that would return a boolean value where a returned value of true would suppress the field and false would show the field

1063568
required	checked
use a tool like dependency walker to checked whether all the required dlls are available or not

1065139
mocking	stubs
dynamic mocking frameworks allow you to stubs out a variety of circumstances no data 1 row many rows exception-handling throw without having to create complex classes to stubs out the behavior you wish to test

1065140
implements	extends
if you didn t want to go that route - maybe there is something more important to member and othermember some other class they should extends or maybe there isn t a true is-a relationship with solid - you could have them implements the isolid interface and delegation all isolid methods to a solid instances member

1065143
interface-builder	iboutlet
i see the first occurrence most often .when i have bound a control to an iboutlet via interface-builder and then removed rename the iboutlet in the underlying class

1065165
toggle	slider
but sounds to me like you want to toggle the slider effect for that you can use the slidertoggle function

1065168
streamreader	binaryreader	streamreader	writer	binaryreader	writer
i would send a binaryreader writer but i am using a streamreader too maybe i should go around that

1065178
implements	extends
basically .when an interface extends from other interface it is forcing the class that implementss it to implements methods in both interfaces

1065189
postdata	request
all this data was stored in a database request types url serialization postdata timestamp current user etc.

1065196
streamreader	binaryreader	streamreader	streamwriter	streamwriter	binaryreader
yes streamreader streamwriter binaryreader and binarywriter all close dispose their underlying streaming .when you call dispose on them

1065201
realloc	malloc
if you use realloc you can always ask for more memory if you don t allocate enough with the initial malloc

1065201
linked-list	arrays
alternatively you could use a linked-list instead of an arrays

1065207
contains	any
any link to show all photos could contains the search and paginator information using the get parameters as you ve describe

1065212
reflection	runtime
i haven t used it but paranamer can give you runtime access to parameter named at the cost of requiring debugging info in code and using reflection to get parameter named

1065214
attributes	properties
if it isn t a properties with a retain attributes then make sure you retain it .when created .so it sticks around and release it in dealloc

1065223
xquery	xslt
if you need a subset of information from a large document you can easily use xslt or xquery to trim out the parts that you need

1065226
contains	elements
the first versioning could be a bit more efficient because it allocates enough room to contains the elements of s1

1065230
required	checked
if you required an up to the second representation of who is online you could maybe have a flash .app loaded in your page that connect to a jabber server then just checked if that particular user is logged in on the server

1065237
contains	any
encounters a limitation of the contains function or any other string-function in xpath for that matter

1065238
linux	minix
for fun i guess you could also see minix it isn t exactly linux but modern operating systemd by tenenbaum is a good read

1065256
changelistener	listener
for example if you have a collections of object it might support a set of listener for different things createlistener changelistener deletelistener

1065256
abstract	extends
a superset abstract listener could provide default do-nothing implementation for each methods .so that a client extends it would only have to overrides the ones they care about

1065265
web-applications	enterprise
java ee refers to the enterprise edition of java which is used to deploy web-applications

1065273
web-applications	enterprise
java ee is the enterprise edition designed for server programming such as soa and web-applications

1065289
superclass	inherited	base-class	inherited	base-class	superclass
you probably do not want to create a base-class with these members and have member and othermember inherited from it because member and othermember have dimension they are not superclass of dimension

1065289
superclass	inherited
.so you need to look at your own domain object and ask yourself is this class a superclass inherited or does it just need to use the other class to defined .some characteristic of itself composition

1065291
swing	awt
if .so you should probably be reminded that swing painting should all be handled on the awt eventqueue

1065302
constructor	object
i think implicit initializer an object is done without explicit calling a constructor

1065302
constructor	object
call a constructor and then throw the newly created exception-handling object

1065305
dependency-injection	inject
- an alternative approach would be to use dependency-injection to inject different implementation for testing

1065306
versioning	upgrade
as codertao mentioned using different versioninging of svn client on a working copy can cause silent wc format upgrade .so be sure to stick within a single versioning family to avoid that

1065308
identity-column	sql-server
an identity-column is by far the fastest and most concurrent solution to generator sequential numbers inside sql-server

1065313
defined	declare
object and variables declare as extern declare an object that is defined in another translation unit or in an enclosing scoping as having external linkage.

1065323
spring	seam
seam spring both have ways around this and there are a couple of things you can do

1065331
nvidia	ati
won t work on ati gfx cards usually works on nvidia gfx cards afaict always works on intel integrated gfx cards.

1065331
debugging	exit
- however if you use this without dosonly enabled command.com will resize back to its previous size as soon as the application in this case unless you wrote it to a file and execute that debugging exit

1065331
any	set
similarly you can set the resolution for any shortcuts to cmd.exe and batch-file right click the shortcut - properties - layout

1065368
shutdown	restart
i have shutdown and restart the sql-server and the database will not drop

1065372
triggers	insert
if one of them is an auto-incrementing numbers then you can generator the value either in a stored proc which is used for all insert or in an insert triggers

1065378
icollection	ienumerable
.so is derived from ilist icollection and in addition to ienumerable and

1065378
ienumerator	ienumerable
the ienumerable interface exposes the getenumerator methods which returns an ienumerator a movenext methods and a current properties

1065388
udp	tcp
there is a public domain benchmarking tool for tcp and udp performance measurement

1065394
filtering	sorting
the right query depends on which sorting filtering you apply to that table .when listing all object

1065399
python	perl
if i currently have only a small amount of bash skill should i invest time in learning to do it well or should i use something else like perl or python

1065402
attributes	properties
i d wholeheartedly embrace the notion that the width height and depth of an object are attributes and that they should be plugged into it through a properties

1065417
subclassing	superclass
then the patches could be applied to the superclass and the subclassing would never actually contains anything

1065431
margins	padding
there is a ccs option using a very big padding and an equally big negative margins but i donâ t remember if it works for all browsers and i can t find the article right now

1065431
margins	padding
edit the big padding negative margins css solution

1065431
firefox	safari
the article is talking about firefox 1.5 and safari 2 .so i don t know if it still works but here it is

1065442
shell	bash
even though i always miss my list comprehensions they are just not native to my shell and for scripting below 10 line my threshold is way lower than skeets but .so are my abilities bash or any native shell language is my quick safe route

1065450
active-directory	adam
i need a routine to randomly selected recording from adam active-directory application mode

1065462
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl
if the solution involves lists hash or any other non-trivial data-structures i would go with a dl like ruby python or perl

1065462
any	set
on the other hand if what i m building will be run on multiple platform without any gaurantee of a standards tool set then i would go with bash or even sh for that matter

1065479
specifications	w3c
you might have to checked the exact w3c specifications

1065488
python	php
i know some python but about half of my scripting are written in php because that is what i know better

1065504
environment	building
however you technically solve this i would recommend to do it the other way round do not do something special for the production building but structure your code and building environment in such a way that the magic happens during the development building

1065524
method-signature	signature
well this method-signature is entry signature and whenever you try to invoke a class with java program it ll search for this function to start execution

1065552
contains	any
there are plenty of useful meaningful conventions that you can use to decipher what they might contains but .when it comes down to it a webserver is free to return any types of thing it wants for a given url

1065568
reflection	runtime	value	field
if you want to checked the value of a variables at runtime you can use reflection to checked the initializer object field like this

1065568
value	field
you can easily go from this implementation to one which uses getter-setter methods invocations to checked the value of inaccessible field

1065579
textbox	onblur	textarea	onblur	textarea	textbox
for a textbox if you use the onblur event the this refers to the textarea which just lost-focus

1065580
euclidean-distance	centroid
calculate euclidean-distance from each points to all centroid

1065600
xsd	xml
i know it is possible to generator skeleton xsd from xml

1065600
xsd	xml
i know there might be collision and the like but assuming all the xml came from an uknown xsd it should be theoreticaly possible

1065606
derived-class	base-class
that s going to be even easier with a using-declaration in the derived-class which makes the member named public and refers to the member of the base-class

1065642
hash	md5
use a hash such as md5

1065658
lookup	any
will there be any further resultset to process if the lookup table in the lookup task is-empty

1065666
python	php
a lot of it depends on which language you are using to write the program if you are using a scriptinging-language like bash python of php you need to make sure the first line of the scripting tells what interpreter to use

1065674
youtube	vimeo
the best way in my humble opinion is to embed video files upload to youtube vimeo or other video upload website

1065735
bash	zsh
bash is good for short scripting especially zsh my favorite .when i don t care about portability python is good for longer more complex scripting.

1065774
arrays	loops
2 is the default initialization as above faster than the usual loops through the whole arrays and assign a value or does it do the same thing

1065782
perforce	git
git might have better options or perforce

1065792
worksheet	excel
i am required to produce a somewhat complicated excel workbook contains over 30 worksheet each using information from several database tables to dynamically draw several tables per sheet with formatting

1065798
mstest	nunit	mstest	mbunit	mbunit	nunit
for me mstest comparing to mbunit nunit and xunit.net is sufficient in terms of features

1065808
primitive	int
in the case of a primitive types like int that means they will be zeroed

1065829
coalesce	nvl
using nvl or coalesce is not an option as i d like to log the rows causing the errors .so that the data can be corrected for the next pass

1065840
user-controls	ascx
ascx are server side user-controls and to my knowledge can only be loaded by a server event

1065840
show	next
then .when the user click on a checkbox or whatever you can use javascript to show that div tag contains the next control

1065844
export	report
i m fairly familiar with python and it looks like from what i ve read i might be able to open the report maybe change some parameters run it and export it

1065851
document	editing
however while nsstepper produces 2 results .when editing a mac nib xib file in interface-builder .when the open ib document is for iphone i get no search results for nsstepper even for step

1065854
filtering	sorting
.when i try to view the output of feed.xml in firefox all of the filtering is applied correctly sorting out items that shouldn t be published in that channel but the page output as plain text rather than the usual feed-detection that takes place in firefox

1065857
actionscript	mxml
i m only interested in debugging actionscript and java no mxml javascript or ajax

1065882
webserver	upload
updates specifically i m referring to downloading upload files between developers and their webserver

1065905
forms-authentication	ntlm
not interested in ntlm or windows forms-authentication

1065916
revision	svn
how can i tell svn to simply quit crying about the conflict and force it to accept my working copy ie overwrite the head revision with my working copy

1065919
revision	svn
in svn for each commit may involve multiple-files it will increment revision numbers of whole repository by one

1065923
sftp	scp
http is commonly used for retrieving files scp or sftp handle the secure aspects basically running the usual protocols through a ssh-tunnel

1065925
selected	checkbox
i would like to selected a set of elements that are both of a certain input types say a checkbox and have a certain class using jquery

1065949
version-control	git
it says that microsoft is using git for version-control but i don t have any evidence that says it s legit

1065965
selected	checkbox
you have to use for checkbox checkbox and the .name attributes to selected by class

1065994
gnome	kde
matchbox is a lightweight and highly-customizable fullscreen windows manager and would be much better suited for this task than any of gnome s or kde s full-featured windows managers

1066014
ubuntu	linux
if you are new to linux then i defiantly recommend ubuntu

1066027
parentheses	keyword	parentheses	let
others might use it to defined specific custom languages that mostly follow python general outline but add special new keyword let you call functions without using parentheses and .so on and .so forth

1066033
checkbox	button
the problem i have is that .when the click me button is click i need to traversal thru the treeview and if a checkbox is checked perform some function

1066034
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
depending on what you want to do you may want to use viewwillappear or viewdidappear instead

1066087
version-control	git
i have some thoughts on using distribute version-control specifically git in the corporate workplace on my blog here

1066093
bug-tracking	bugzilla
if you re looking to use cvs on large project over a long period of time and are thinking about using bugzilla for your bug-tracking then i would suggest looking into cvszilla

1066109
selected	checkbox
basically i have some checkbox and i only want the users to be able to selected a certain numbers of them

1066116
attributes	properties
the attributes which marks a properties as an identity properties in the model tool is in the sync service panels and is only used by sync service not core data itself

1066121
constructor	private
your caching class should have a private constructor

1066121
constructor	private	instances	private
since the constructor is private you are sure that only caching class can create the instances during initialization or first updates

1066121
instances	private
.when all you object have the same instances then you can simply notify caching to updates the single private instances call caching.updates from somewhere

1066138
attributes	properties	subclassing	accessor
one of the best ways to generator correct accessor in your nsmanagedobject subclassing is to bring up the contextual menu on a attributes or properties in the data-modeling tool and choose one of the following cmd

1066144
bcel	jvm
if you just want to know stuff of about the class you can load it without resolving or use a byte code engineering libs like bcel to open the class without loading it into the jvm

1066152
json	xml
you could write a json store as an alternative to the xml store format

1066156
widget	popup
if you want a nice cross-platform way to create nice light-weight popup windowss actually they shared their parent windows then maybe use a javascript widget libs like extjs

1066162
type-conversion	int
remove right-most quote revised to avoid error from implicit type-conversion to int

1066174
implements	super
and if child implements and hide the parent nonvirtual it is super easy to not get the what many might consider expected behavior of calling child nonvirtual

1066179
versioning	upgrade
but it s entirely possible that phpunit was upgrade to emit a different format in newer versioninging or sir-vestnik could be running an older versioning

1066213
put	get
edit - i just want to get a list of all the product from the xml .doc and put them into a generics list

1066237
extensibility	principles
everything you make virtual is in principles an extensibility hook the function can be changed to do anything whatsoever

1066237
derived-class	base-class
anywhere an object of base-class b is expected you should be able to pass an object of derived-class d

1066240
javascript-engine	spidermonkey
however these are only available in the latest versioning of the spidermonkey javascript-engine

1066241
any	set
.so while i m no llvm expert by any means i would guess that if eg you wanted to represent .some 8bit character set you d use an arrays of i8 8bit int or a pointers to i8

1066254
extjs	gxt
if the added overhead of all the extjs libs are too much for you in gwt-ext then the gxt project from extjs may be more your speed

1066261
margins	padding
any right margins or padding you apply to the p will also apply to the img

1066270
constructor	object	copy-constructor	constructor
c++ string is a complex object with a constructor destructor and copy-constructor

1066274
inlining	inline
also consider not directly inlining the css but rather use some sort of object similar that will generator the css inline for you

1066294
value	field
2b you can fill all the value for every possible choice into hidden field that are id d in some way by the value in the first box this is not desirable but is possible depending on the security and size of your dataset

1066328
csv	xml
i use notepad++ for editing html xml csv and other text based code like files on windows

1066336
wsdualhttpbinding	duplex
i know that wsdualhttpbinding nettcpbinding and netpeertcpbinding binding all support duplex callback service operations

1066344
filtering	sorting	jtable	jtree
glazedlists a gui adaptor framework for viewing editing navigating filtering sorting binding lists of object with a jtable or jtree

1066359
hide	show
rather than hide and show since they can take a speed parameter for fancy animation

1066367
hide	show
if you instead made a string with all the ids seperated by comma you could selected and hide show them all in one action

1066368
compatibility	legacy
compatibility of legacy solutions and customizations

1066368
click	mouse
mouse click and other events on the

1066369
margins	padding

spring	guice
spring also solves the same problem but started from an xml perspective whereas guice is annotations -driven

1066390
put	get
here s some code i wrote this weekend to get an image from a twain device via windows image acquser-interfacesition 2.0 and put the data into something i can shove in a gtk based user-interface

1066398
authentication	login
if your users are using ie then you can turn on integrated-security for the website and your users will be authentication silently no login dialog no login page

1066399
expression	evaluation
since you mentioned this it seems to me like you are expecting the path properties to be evaluated before the xpath expression which would be why you are getting an error the xpath expression is evaluation on whatever your current context is and the path is being evaluated after that

1066409
overwrite	preserve
the purpose of the overwrite list more commonly called the clobber list is to inform gcc that as a result-of the assembly instructions the register s listed in the clobber list will be modified and .so the compiler should preserve any which are currently live

1066413
textbox	button
it should generator all needed html and javascript core for me just as nitrogen does and support all needed components like span p button textbox passwordfield...

1066455
getter	setter
think about it - your getter and setter are really doing something

1066455
getter	setter
you can t bypass them without changing the semantics completely and i wouldn t expect a setter to run just because i changed something in what the getter had returned

1066467
value	field
how do i read set a hidden html field such that i can access the value i need on subsequent page request

1066468
attributes	properties
the height attributes unlike height styles properties accept numeric value only

1066481
hide	show
one way to handle this scenario would be to hide the overlay windows in the application.ondeactivate event and to show it on the application.onactivate event

1066481
overlay	z-order
just remember to set the z-order of the overlay windows lower than your modal-dialog

1066486
testng	junit	easymock	testng	easymock	junit
junit testng and easymock for testing there are many others those are the ones we use

1066486
easymock	junit
junit allows you to easily create methodss that run as part of a test easymock allows you to create mock or fake object to pass in that will respond in very specific ways which you can use to test a methods that relies on a framework or running environment that isn t there during testing

1066516
csv	xml
for xml should be application xhtml+xml for csv - text plain etc.

1066532
defined	declare
although kss differs from nitrogen in that it defined a simple domain-specific language dsl for declaring how javascript-events should be bound to an html page on the client side and this dsl can also declare that events need to triggers a server-side component via ajax

1066532
pylons	django	web-frameworks	pylons
there are binding to use kss with many of python popular web-frameworks django pylons zope plone grok

1066542
mpfr	gmp
recent versioning of gcc around 4.3 added the ability to use gmp and mpfr to do some compile-time optimizations by evaluation more complex functions that are constants

1066561
silverlight	wpf	organization	naming
i believe that wpf kept this organization and naming conventions for compatibility with silverlight where visualstatemanager was first implements

1066562
textbox	button
then add a button and a textbox onto each of the forms and compare the designer generator code in the winforms .app to the xaml in the wpf .app

1066584
median	max	median	min
scan the dataset for the min max median mean

1066585
any	set
even before you identify any faces it clusters similar ones together .so that it s easy to go through a set of similar faces and give most of them the same named

1066637
attributes	properties
the attributes you can add to your user-controls are simply properties in your code-behind

1066639
arguments	default
there s no way to skip an arguments other than to specify a default like false or null

1066642
shopping-cart	cart
take a look at an open source shopping-cart such as dashcommerce to get a good idea of how a working cart systemd is set up

1066644
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
ie6 is one of the obvious ones but then there are all the release versioning of mozilla firefox opera safari etc etc

1066647
python	java
see nonblocking console input in python and java

direct3d	directx
i ve been experimenting with the dxut functions for direct3d applications in the march 2009 directx sdk

1066651
any	set
if i set the bhandlemessages parameter to true everything resize and resets without any intervention on my part

1066651
any	set
if i set bhandlemessages to false none of the resizing works but i don t get a crash nor any memory-leaks on exit

1066662
worksheet	excel
if the excel worksheet are structured as lists then ado might be the way to go - more info here

1066662
worksheet	excel
use ado in excel to read from the access database and use vba to compare the returned value to the excel worksheet

1066662
worksheet	excel
as describe in robert harvey s answer make the excel worksheet a linked table in the access database and query with sql using access itself

1066662
worksheet	excel
using ado and adox make the excel worksheet a linked table in the access database and query with sql using ado in excel

1066666
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays	arrays	loops
a foreach loops goes through each item in the arrays much like a for-loop

1066673
key-value	key
that foreach takes each key-value pair in that arrays and places the key in and the value in

1066677
arrays	map
i have the following issue related to iterator over an associativity arrays of strings defined using std map

1066681
contains	elements
i heard a rumor that in c arrayss that are contains inside struct may have padding added in between elements of the arrays

1066687
dictionary	arrays
everyone has explained the two constants arrays that are being set up for the tags but if you want to use an nsstring you can simply add it to the attributes dictionary as-is

1066693
32-bit	16-bit
assuming shorts are 16-bit and you re on 32-bit the size will probably be 8 bytes as each struct members tends to be aligned a words 32-bit in this case boundary

1066714
serialization	marshalling
because your exception-handling may need to be marshalling between different appdomains and if they aren t properly serialization you will lose precious debugging information

1066722
firefox	safari
on the following page the orange buy topo map link will open a page in ie7 and firefox and safari but not in ie8

1066726
difference	factors
clearly that factors of 1 2 isn t making a difference since mine is .so much faster

1066729
firefox	safari
xmlhttprequest - in firefox and safari but not in ie it can be used for long-pull page loading that enables to handle fragments as they appear on each readystatechange event

1066730
any	set
is there any way to leverage the existing controls .so we don t have to re-implement paging .sorting and all the other things that gridview are already set up to do or will i just have to create my own gridview-like control from scratch

1066730
selected	button	value	field
.when the save button is click the date selected by the calendar control needs to be saved to the database as the new value for the given field of the given document instances of the form

1066730
value	field
this would probably work for display the field value but if the user tries to edit and save one of the formdocument s i don t know how i would convince the gridview to do something like this

1066730
databound	gridview
those value are then applied to the given properties of the object in the gridview s databound ienumerable

1066735
javascript	dom
i am getting re-execution of import javascript files upon a hitting a form button which call a function to insert a dom elements into page in simulation to exe of an ajx callback

1066737
double	int	primitive	int
for anything that is a primitive types int double float you don t need the asterisk

1066740
oracle	mysql
this is with mysql but i m sure oracle supports transactional

1066742
radio-button	button
i put in an input button to run the scripting below after a partials postback and the scrollable functionality works after i click it .so i m guessing after the radio-button click partials postback the javascripting below that is needed by scrollable isn t being run

1066757
button	popup
the browser will usually forget the old value popup another user pass input dialog and if users then press the abort button they are logged out

1066757
logout	login
the abort the login to logout dialog may surprise users a bit

1066776
nsresponder	nstextview
as you work your way up the chaining from nstextview to its parent class nsresponder you would find that it eventually inherited from nsobject

1066785
highlight	selected
.when someone selected a row in the table the row gets highlight green

1066785
highlight	selected
if i wanted to highlight the row under the one selected what is the easiest way to achieve this

1068137
for-loop	loops
foreach is elegant in that it has no concern for the numbers of items in a list and treats each elements equally i think your only solution will be using a for-loop that either stops at itemcount-1 and then you present your last item outside of loops or a conditionalal within loops that handles that specific conditional if i itemcount .

1068152
freebsd	linux	linux	unix

1071288
getter	setter
in points of fact you should have both a no-args constructor and getter and setter methods

1071288

then in your save methods you would start by setting that properties to the empty string and then doing all the real work inside a try-catch that if an exception-handling occurs pushes the exception-handling messages into that properties .so it automatically show up in the tooltip

1071598
selected	checkbox
.when installing mingw have you selected the checkbox to install mingw s make too

i don t think that you have any choice but to use a nsmutablearray building it with a for-loop and if it s really important that the result not be mutable construct a nsarray and use arraywitharray

1071718
function-call	inline
several of my own answers on .so have fallen foul of this - for example the function-call overhead .when .something like operators is not inline can be very significant

1071720
linux	osx
i program on linux and osx systemd primarily and am interested in something cross-platform across osx linux and windows

1071726
arrays	loops
the reason that your arrays iterator is faster is that the the numbers of iterator is constants and compiler is able to unroll loops

if class a is using class b and class a is class b s delegation is it ok if the delegation is set to nil in class b s dealloc

1071768
delegation	dealloc
i have seen code usually resetting the delegation to nil inside class a s dealloc but wasn t sure the real difference doing it one way or the other

1071790
togglebutton	expander
updates got a hold of blend after generator a templates for the expander it pretty much just required going through and deleting the ellipse and path from each togglebutton styles

1071790
expander	grid
i m just traveling directly to the grid that contains the arrow and header content instead of trying to find the controls by named .so this won t work exactly as is if you are al.so re-templating the expander into a different structure

1071790
contains	set
once we ve located the contains grid we can set the arrow and circle to be collapse and make sure that the header content is move all the way to the left

at this stage we have departed from using jquery to .post complex types to controllers

1071974
32-bit	64bit
does a application in .net need to be built-in 64bit to take full advantage of a machine with a 64bit os on it or will it take advantage of it just as a 32-bit building

1072007
png	gif
alex s solution should work but another way to do it would be to remove the border-left css atrtribute from #content and instead use a 1 pixels wide gray gif or png image on the div contains the submenu items

environment	building
how can i satisfy the 3rd-party shared libs s reference to stat given my building environment

1072112
hide	show
as the title implies i m using jquery s show and hide functions to hide and show elements

1072112
hide	show
ideally what i would like to happen is .when the function is called to hide an elements the object s width goes from it s original width to 0 and it s alpha drops to 0 then the reverse would happen .when i tell it to show

for each ticket a developer will create a branch using savana and .when ready promote this user branch back to trunk

1072161
selected	button
i would also add some labels saying selected account types to create then have one single button press that send the value in the combobox to the model

1072161
selected	button	highlight	selected
this way if the user just click the button without selected an account types the model will valid the types and return the problem to the view and the view can highlight the box or red the text or whatever

1072168
textbox	button
you don t need to wait until someone click the save button once the textbox gets updates it will be validation

1072186

subclassing	inherited
we know that we can have our existing constants class subclassing this new project s constants class and it would inherited all of the parent s static-members

1072203
.war	jar
this will create a zipfile with the layout you have specified in your output directory configuration package the whole thing as a zipfile you can choose zip jar .war ... and deploy it in my repository with the rest

1072212
delegation	dealloc
yes you should set the classb s delegation properties to nil in classa s dealloc

1072212
delegation	dealloc
it s not a memory-management issue because delegation properties should be marked assign not retain to avoid retain cycles otherwise the dealloc will never be called

1072212
delegation	dealloc
.so yes nil out the delegation properties in classa s dealloc

1072217
implements	final
i ve seen this done by putting the static final string on an interface .so that you can implements it and not have to worry about what to do .when you need a different base-class

1072249
fflush	stdout
if your programs are communication using stdin and stdout then make sure that you are either calling fflush stdout after you write or find some way to disable standards io buffering

1072251
linux	unix
unix and linux piping run all cmd concurrently

1072251
fflush	stdout
if you re using c calling fflush stdout whenever you want output sent will be sufficient

1072271
put	get
put it in an nsarray category and that s about as good as it is going to get

1072293
network-interface	multicast
on the other hand network-interface can give you a bunch of specific technical info such as speed or whether it supports multicast

1072300
interceptor	inject
the critical feature of java.lang.instrument i m looking for is to simply inject interceptor around methods call without changing source attributes on methodss classes or rebuilding existing assemblies to inject the interception code

1072303
python	perl	python	java
c# python perl java vb.net whatever you use

1072327
rhino-mocks	nunit
i ve tried the following i m using nunit with rhino-mocks

1072344
webforms	asp.net
also the html elements on asp.net webforms are treated like text-files and parsing at runtime rather than being compiled as strongly-typed classes.

1072344
javascript	dom
another note i think google web toolkit bears some similarity to this idea although it s written in java and aimed more at ajax javascript dom rather than standards-based xhtml css and javascript

1072360
specifications	w3c
the w3c specifications seem to long for me to digest and the document to transform are not that large

1072371
arrays	loops
you could use preg_split to get the individual arrays indic then a loops to apply those indic one by one

1072385
udp	tcp
may be you can try tools like ttcp which can both test tcp and udp performance

1072399
python	java
examples of this are .net s keynotfoundexception java s arrayindexoutofboundsexception and python keyerror

1072401
uitableview	uiview
the goal is to include the uitableview inside of a parent uiwindow or uiview with other stuff anything really adorning the table

1072401
uitableview	uiview
drag the uitableview out of the uitableviewcontroller and into the main uiview

1072411

the downside is calling get after contains duplicates operations

1072414
aggregate-functions	sum
grouping by clause and working with aggregate-functions such as sum min max etc

1072416
stdin	pipe
if your two programs insist on reading and writing to files and do not use stdin stdout you may find you can use a named pipe instead of a file

that way you could get from a map without having to checked if it contains the key without having to checked if it returns a null and without having to catch any exception-handling

1072437
temporary	copy
copy all elements from #my-interesting-fields into a temporary that you dynamically create outside form1 then call serialization on that

1072439
subclassing	base-class
my goal is to have a base-class from which others are extended whose principal purpose is to make mandatory the implementation of certain methods by named is fine no signature necessary by those subclassing

1072439
subclassing	superclass
i don t really care if it s a purely virtual class like an interface in java or a concrete class with actual implementsational stubs for those methods in the superclass but what i want is to make it deterministically necessary that the subclassing implements certain methods of the superclass

1072468
malloc	free
malloc is not finding next free block coz of previous case of over running and hence not able to allocate for mentioned spaces and if u give 1024 malloc is finding one block where that much free spaces is available and is getting allocated

1072504
instances	self
the self encapsulates instances methods on the current object as well as instances-variables

1072522
compatibility	platform
i once had an opportunity to ask anders hejlsberg whether we couldn t get active attributes in .net but his response was that if microsoft provided such a capability they might as well stop all further development of the platform because it would be impossible to move .net forwarding without breaking compatibility with someone s code i may be misrepresenting his answer but the essential part is that it has been considered and rejected - apparently for good reasons

1072533
paintcomponent	draw
you could draw it on a jpanel by overrides the paintcomponent methods

1072552
primitive	int
an arrays is one contiguous object and int is a primitive types not an object types .so there are no object created for the 10 int s

1072558

1072565
32-bit	64bit
we both have 64bit machines and i guess before we were both using 32-bit jdks but recently i had .some problems and .so i removed all jdks and install the latest 64bit jdk and i m not sure .when but my friend is al.so now running a 64bit jdk

1072565
32-bit	64bit
our game was running fine in the 32-bit jdk but with the 64bit versioning the game won t start

1072566

1072629
python	java
hardest thing i was confronted to in using python coming from java was to properly wrap my head around the duck-typing thing.

1072633
directory	folder
listing a directory will only give you the named of the files folder in question .so you must manually stat each filename returned to get information about each file itself

1072634

1072713
firefox	safari
as they are supposed to have transparency backgrounds in safari and firefox

1072723
push	pull	git-repo	repo
that git-repo will represent your submodule but if you modify and push that submodule you will still have to pull from that git-repo to the actual hg repo

1072726
highlight	selected
you can set separate images for different states normals highlight disabled selected etc

1072731

g++	gcc
you can add new directory to the include-search path by passing them to gcc g++ using -i option

1072753
any	set
any occurrences of .app callapi ... will need to be replace with a query or set of queries that do the same thing

1072753
file-handling	readfile
any occurrences of will need to be replace with the correct file-handling functions in php such as move_uploaded_file readfile etc.

1072754
duplicates	elements
nice thing about guava is that among the several implementation of it there was one where the list behaves as a set no duplicates elements actually it s no duplicates key + value elements that really helped

1072771
aggregate	grouping
- get the min value per grouping with an aggregate query derived table x above

1072771
subtract	add
- subtract the min value from the identity value and add 1 if you need to start numbering at 1 and voila you have numbers that restart at 1 for each grouping

1072778
difference	count
in linq there is a count extension methods on which inside the clr will shortcut to .count if the underlying types is of ilist .so performance difference is negligible

1072780
treeview	gridview
.when i click treeview nodes i want to bind data to a gridview on the product page

1072786
sortedlist	sorted
i found sortedlist but it required key val i m looking for something like list string - only sorted

1072793
pixels	line
i want them to align vertically but the first list item is always being pushed a pixels or two two far to the right .so it no longer line up with the other members in the list

1072812
defined	declare
in c and c++ a pointers declare as void is defined to have no types

1072817
updating	updates
null value are not entered into the index which means that insert updating rows with null in there doesn t take the performance hit of having to updates another secondary index

1072853
python	java
i just want to know if there is a program that can convert an xsd file to a python class as jaxb does for java

1072854
youtube	vimeo
it s actually working but the problem is i am having different types of video source youtube vimeo etc and there is some delay in ajax response and display of video object

1072860
http-get	put
webget as you ve already stated applies to the http-get verb while webinvoke can be used to apply to all the other verbs put .post delete etc

1072861
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if you want to know if the current date falls between two given points in time 9am - 5pm on 7 1 09 use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents to building nsdate instances for the desired time and compare them with the current date

1072861
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
create an nsdatecomponents object with and nscalendar and your nsdate and compare the hour components

1072883
linux	unix
i want to learn to program in a unix linux environment

1072883
perl	c++
i ll be using the c++ and perl programming languages as well as learning bash of course

1072907
pointers	stack
usually a pointers to the calling instruction .so that the viewmodel in this case the cpu in native apps will know where to set the instruction pointers or pc - program counter .so stack will be unfolded correctly

1072917
linux	bsd
any of the bsd s and many of the linux s should work fine even mac os x

1072917
ubuntu	linux
if you choose linux then i suggest going with ubuntu as that has one of the best automatic hardware configuration i have seen

1072920
python	php
python or php based framework will do better

1072922
linux	unix
to be called unix you have to pass a certification that it conforms to the specifications .so linux is more precisely called a unix-like operating systemd

1072922
linux	unix
the main paradigms remain even if many particulars will change if you go from linux to unix and from unix to another unix flavor

1072922
freebsd	bsd
then .when you are more familiar with how things work .so you can manage to .solve issues by yourself with ease and to get a feeling about a different flavor of os try open.solaris nexenta or .some bsd flavor for instances freebsd

1072922
configuration	environment
the rea.son for this is that you ll be able to get an environment which works without much or any trouble using mainstream linux whereas with less used free unices you ll may hit upon unsupported hardware harder configuration and .so on

1072923
linux	osx
these days with people opting for linux osx windows platform independence is a big feature

1072933
value	field
for example in the leadbase table you will find a field called deletionstatecode a value of 0 implies the recording has not been deleted

1072939
perl	c++	ubuntu	debian
the major distros ubuntu debian fedora suse and many others should all have a good variety of c++ perl development tools available because c++ perl apps are a core part of pretty much every distribution

1072941
restart	reload
then to use make sure you restart screens or reload the .screensrc

1072952
constructor	object
i am creating a normals mock but i am pasing in an instances of the real component2 in as a constructor arguments into the mock object

1072953
perl	php
in this autocommand call a small external tool php perl or whatever scripting that stripes off the last newline of the just written file

1072957

.when the systemd is ready for deployment it is transfer to a live ip-address meaning it is visible to the world has a real database and other real resources ready to support it

1072981
icollection	ienumerable
however if you need items count don t forget that there is another layer between ienumerable and ilist - icollection

1072985
selected	textbox
i have a form with a datagridview showing a list of customers and some textbox below showing details of the customer selected in the grid

1072989
getter	setter
it generator the python class with all methods setter and getter export to xml import from xml

1073007

inside an instances methods definitions self is an instances

1073041
udp	tcp
is there any way i can connect the two through tcp udp protocols without everything going through a special server somewhere

1073063
kentico	umbraco
i suppose the complexity of learning somewhere between kentico and umbraco

1073079
jquery	.post
see for example .post request with jquery javascript libs

fxcop assemblies are 32-bit my project was 64bit

1073100
internet-explorer	firefox
do firefox and internet-explorer have the same proxy settings

1073100
google-chrome	firefox
i sometimes have the same happen to me .when i m inspector http traffic with fiddler and my computer crash although in that case its the other way around ie google-chrome etc give me the error messages and firefox works splendidly

1073119
hide	show
the question is does the hide show of the textbox dropdownlistfor have to be written in the view or the controllers class

1073137
external	embed
instead of making the user always do right click- run as you can embed a manifest using external manifest tool with privileges set to requireadministrator

1073147
hide	show
the question is does the hide show of the textbox dropdownlistfor have to be written in the view or the controllers class

1073147
hide	show
just show hide with jquery that

1073147
.when	ready
.post form to save action only once .when it s ready .when save button is click

1073150
hide	show
if you use javascript to show and hide the controls then because it s on the client side you would not have to postback the form and could do server side validation .when the save button is click

1073155
updating	updates
also i ve noticed that the updates statement it generator for the rows that need updating it says that is on all the field columns

1073157
malloc	free
is it a portable behavior of stdlib malloc and free or am i looking for trouble

1073157
malloc	free
the question is about the malloc 0 + free combinations not the value of pointers

1073161
linux	unix
in this regard it is more like a traditional unix than a modern linux distribution

1073161
linux	unix	ubuntu	linux	configuration	environment
these are both capable systemdd but differ somewhat in their userspace architecture the tooling for the desktop environment and default configuration for systemd security works a bit differently on ubuntu than it does on most other linux or unix flavours but this is of little relevance to development

1073161
linux	unix
from a the perspective of a developer all modern flavours of unix and linux are very similar and shared essentially the same developer toolchain

1073161
emacs	vim
most unix programming can be accomplished quite effectively with a programmer s editor such as vim or emacs both of which come in text mode and windows flavours

1073161
linux	unix
some postings on stackoverflow that discuss linux unix resources are

1073161
installation	building
if you have the time and want to do a real tour of the nuts and bolts linux from scratch is a tutorial that goes through building a linux installation by hand

1073161
python	perl
learning one of the dynamic-languages such as perl or python if you are not already familiar with these is also a useful thing to do

1073161
toolchain	gnu	cygwin	gnu
architecturally cygwin is a ports of glib and the crt the gnu toolchain s base libs as an adaptor on top of win32

1073161
linux	unix
this emulation layer makes it easy to ports unix linux apps onto cygwin

1073169
realloc	calloc	realloc	free	realloc	malloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
free frees the memory spaces pointed to by pointers which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

1073175
malloc	free	calloc	free	calloc	malloc
free address is ok if address was received from malloc or others like calloc etc.

1073177
arguments	default
line will not be concatenation .when using 3 as the second arguments to error_log and using 0 will write the output to the default location specified in php-ini

1073180
entity-framework	nhibernate
i m seeing a lot of orms like the entity-framework nhibernate etc

1073181
firefox	opera
explorer mozilla firefox opera and

1073216
highlight	cell
the highlight procedure is called from the worksheet_change event a lookup is done on the charts named the ranges and colours pulled from the table and then the cell formatting is carried out

1073238
rad-controls	telerik
if you have multiple live sites i recommend keeping them all in the same versioning of telerik rad-controls

1073239
set	bag
is this a case where i should use set over bag

1073239
set	bag
i ve read up a little on bag vs set and to me it seems like set perhaps would solve my unique row issue but still as this is just a jointable my biggest concern is to be able to delete connection and remove a contactinfo from a grouping

1073245
unix	bsd
its a unix bsd based os but with a really slick user-interface over the top

1073245
linux	unix
if you do look at a mac definitely take a look at the macports project which package a large amount of the open source unix linux software up making installation of programming tools incredibly easy

1073251
eventmachine	typhoeus
i think it works better with other libs like typhoeus typhoeus or if you re usning eventmachine em-http-request they both allow multi-request and you should be able to send more than 2 to the same domain at least it does with ubuntu

1073258
32-bit	64bit
i d stop worrying about 64bit vs 32-bit and try to diagnose the actual problem

1073262
dictionary	arrays
if you have some flexibility over the xml structure you could look at using the in-built cmd to load and save a dictionary or arrays from to a file such as

1073276
getter	setter
next apple for good reasons recommends against using getter setter in your init dealloc

1073276
destroy	self
next after super dealloc your object is destroy .so you cannot reference self and hence your ivars after that .so your dealloc should look like

1073276
getter	setter
further as above apple recommends you should not use setter or getter in your dealloc routine .so your deallocation would initially look like

1073290
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i have tested this in ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 3 firefox 3.5 and recent versioning of google-chrome opera and safari on windows

1073302
set	bag
reason is that in mnesia you can t set index types and always is duplicates bag

1073316
linux	unix
any modern versioning of unix or linux you can get running on your machine will be fine

1073316
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
one of the bsds freebsd openbsd netbsd

1073331
contains	set
lets say you have the string variables urlwithspaces which is set to a url which contains spaces

1073333
time-complexity	in-place
in-place time-complexity o n log n worst case o n best case

1073337
assign	add
collapse to find max add a 0 to the end for rotate later assign to s

1073353
export	csv	.when	ready
we have an application which is going to export data to various formats for example csv and excel and i would like to open up explorer windows with these files selected .when they are created and ready to be viewed

1073366
put	get
it works fine until i try to put back the value from the rtb into the webbrowser then i get a

1073392
getter	setter
in c# you can create getter setter in a simpler way than other languages

1073415
double-quotes	spaces
spaces and other characters are allowed but you have to delimit the identifier with square brackets or double-quotes

1073437
binaries	install
use openoffice.org oodoc it understands the xml format of openoffice.org document required no openoffice.org binaries to be running or even to have openoffice.org install

1073438
administration	account
it would be for example possible to use an administration account - during a uac elevation during .app setup - to add a access-control list entry granting mebers of the users grouping some kind of create write control to subfolders or files in the public desktop

1073438
account	api
.so unless your sample program is trying to demonstrate a methods to write files in a shared location from an unelevated account you would be far better off creating your file in the users own desktop - c users youruseraccount desktop - the path to which you retrieve is using the appropriate shgetspecialfolderlocation api of course

1073455
exception-handling	try-catch
if you need to catch an exception-handling from it all surround all the code with a try-catch

1073467
fflush	gets
3 once testing is complete the pre-production environment gets fflush back from live

1073467
ready	live
4 if the release works and you would usually perform some testing to checked all of your components it s ready to be run in live

1073475
do-while	goto
while using goto for error-handling situations is fairly common i d still prefer the while solution or do-while

1073497
32-bit	64bit
i am aware of hasp which makes 32-bit linux compatible dongles but i need 32-bit and 64bit support

1073511
any	set
then set debugging exception-handling to checked for all clr exception-handling .so that any exception-handling that occur in sharepoint will break at the error

1073533
value	field
now i want to perform validation in the form like whether all the field value have been filled

1073534
selected	button
after that pressing the button will change display month to selected date s one

1073539
32-bit	16-bit
data size changes - this was a nasty one .when moving from 16-bit to 32-bit

1073540
communication	messages
if you have a messages pump anyway because you need to communication with other process or threads via windows-messagess or you need to do ole stuff then it may be easiest to use timer messagess

1073567
fiddler	charles
use something like fiddler or charles not firebug s .net panels or anything else that s actually inside the browser to examine what s actually coming over the wire

1073570
python	perl
i would say this function has some functional-programming background and its purpose is to do something which each item of a list and return a new list like map in python or perl

1073583
z-index	overlay
another approach to working round the z-index limitation is to use a pop-up to overlay your wpf components over the html

1073604
websphere	ibm
this is a bit similar to some ibm rational model tools for websphere

1073626
arrays	map
note you can use that pattern on your target data and the arrays of matches you get back should correspond with the elements namedd in map arrays - named match 1 is in map 1 etc

1073634
sqrt	pow
alternatively to using the pow function you could simply defined a square function and use the sqrt function in math.h which would probably improve performance a bit

1073638
cllocation	altitude
cllocation contains an altitude

1073670
web-config	app-config
one option if your connection-string is stored within a web-config or app-config file for web and windows apps respectively you can encrypt the value

1073671
pascal	delphi
the excellent delphi jedi project has converted most of the windows api header-files into delphi pascal

1073682
put	get
put simply you can t get the value of the sun.os.patch.level properties without throw an accesscontrolexception

1073688
arguments	default
al.so did you realize that the last 3 arguments you used are the default .so you could cut that part out to shorten your code

1073701
jsonp	ajax
you have to also use the datatype option in your ajax call set to jsonp as well as specify the correct callback arguments

1073727
any	set
i don t set any animation on the tiledlayer

1073738
getter	setter
it is fine but proper as3 practice is to use the for only internal private protected variables and then write getter and setter without the

1073740
innodb	myisam
make sure you have an index on code if your table is innodb and id is a primary key or on code id if your table is myisam or id is not a primary key

1073757
lgpl	gpl
if you use the lgpl contributions from other people can still be done under the gpl which would prevent you from reusing their code in close-source software

1073760
contains	any	getter	setter
besides that a properties is nothing else than a getter and a setter methods from a design perspective a properties should never contains any computations other than initializing or validation eg

1073771
groovy	scala
hence a language like scala fan groovy would be a good starting point.once you get a hang of the basic semantics of using a functional language as well as start loving it you can move onto a language like ruby

1073773
contains	any
i would recommended releasing under lgpl or bsd styles license which does not contains any responsibilities from your side

1073791
document	editing
it looks and works fine in the browser however the page the map appears in is sometimes converted to a words document for editing after conversion the map either disappears if using background divs or display all it s component parts consecutively if using img tags

1073800
hide	show
need to find the best way to selectively show and hide sections divs etc on click or changing a value of a control but not having to postback javascript

1073810
hide	show
you can use a jquery event to detection a click and then hide or show divs

1073812
revision	updates
2 i expect this to be the case help formats are often updates expanded with help viewer revision that go with vs release

1073825
web-services	api
i m trying to glue together two web-services by passing a value from one to the other unfortunately there s no api or clear way of hacking up the search query .so i need to set the value of a input inside an iframe

1073827
contains	set
if your model allows it you can even describe the object that are present one the different tile and set them as impassable the waiting room a 6 tile x 4 tile room if fully passable but contains a set of chairs and a small water fountain that rendering some subtile impassables

1073863
webforms	asp.net
for anyone who switches back and forth between developing asp.net webforms and winforms this tip may come in handy

1073884
hide	show
how to i hide and show html elements using jquery without any special effects

1073886
hide	show
using the hide and show methods

1073886
hide	show
the toggle methods just call show if hidden or hide if its not

1073902
.when	ready
you could replace the shell as above then have your application launchd explorer.exe .when you were ready to have the start menu and taskbar show up.

1073903
hide	show
see the jquery online documentation for show hide and toggle

1073910
constructor	object
functions are object too but they may just as well be constructor of object

1073910
constructor	object
while constructor functions are useful there are time .when we only need only one instances of that object

1073910
value	field
but that would make all instances of that class having the same value for that field

1073921
put	get
i ve always had to put a z-index on .sf-menu li li to get the sub-menus to show up in ie6 7

1073932
value	field
any change of instances or class field value is a side effect as is drawing something on the screens writing to a file or a network connection

1073950
haskell	scala
doug mcclean above -- this sounds like what scala call option and haskell call maybe

1073960

1073989
asp.net-mvc	webforms
after having worked in asp.net-mvc for a few months i m back in a previously written webforms 3.5 application and i m trying to fix up what i can with what i ve learned

1073990
any	set
using my main application s hwnd how can i set any modal child windows as the active-windows

1074009
jquery	dojo
a couple of months ago i was doing javascript programming on the facebook platform on which the major frameworks such as dojo extjs jquery prototype etc

1074010
png	gif
for the background-image if you are not using inline-styles in your actual code and depending on your background-image and acceptable loss of quality you can save the png as a gif and use

1074014
pointers	stack
it shouldn t matter if i have a stack reference or pointers value to std exception-handling

1074017
arrays	loops
if you already have the arrays of int there is not quick way to convert you re better off with loops

1074018
checkbox	button
for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined

1074024
arguments	default
.so if you don t supply a value for the dwflags arguments you ll get those default flags

1074046
factors	digits
if i understand you correctly you want to create 63 milion codes of 10 digits that have a low guess factors

1074061
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the big problem appears to be the httpcontext - asp.net-mvc pages rely on a httpcontextbase rather than httpcontext like webforms do and while both implements iserviceprovider they re not related

1074061
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the designers of asp.net-mvc made a deliberate decision not to change the legacy webforms to use the new context base however they did provide a wrapper

1074068
inno-setup	nsis
both nsis and inno-setup will cope with all the tasks specified

1074068
inno-setup	nsis
inno-setup uses a pascal-like language for its scriptinging nsis uses its own scripting language

1074084
subclassing	superclass
most ides can be configure to show a warning if you refer to a superclass constants via a subclassing and i d guess static analysis tools like findbugs can do it too

1074088
deployment	install
if you want to use standards deployment methods with your install you probably should stay away from nsis

1074091
combinations	permutation
a combinations without repetitions is called permutation

1074091
contains	elements
if the input list is not guaranteed to contains unique elements as suggested in another answer it can be a bit more difficult

1074091
duplicates	elements
if you meant not having duplicates elements in the answer as a result-of duplicates elements in the input just add a removeduplicates as show below

1074093
contains	any
.so is there any way to say to intellij this dir contains my external dependencies .so automatically parsing these for autocomplete etc and add them to the classpath .when i launchd my .app from the ide

1074098
selected	button
all i would add to the other answers is if you want to ensure the user makes a choice instead of accepting a default chosen by you use a pair of radio button neither one selecteded and required them to selected one before proceeding

1074110
64bit	x86
and on 64bit windows program files x86 microsoft sdks

1074142
push	pull
either way you can always push pull changes from one repository to another .so the changes made in the clone aren t lost in your main repository

1074145
margins	padding
i have a div with margins and padding in it

1074145
hide	show
i am using javascript to show hide process

1074162
margins	padding
you can use nested divs place the padding and marginss you do not want to hide in the parent div and the padding and margins you do want to hide in the child div and only hide the child div with your javascript

1074168
any	set
if you re talking about a column in a database-table it is advisable to set the maximum length of a varchar2 to the minimum length allowable by the requirements - like any other constraint it helps to use these inbuilt features of the database to ensure only valid data gets saved if a surname with 1000 characters is input i m pretty sure that will be wrong and perhaps highlight a bug in a program somewhere

1074207
pivot-table	pivot-chart
selected your data then click on data - pivot-table and pivot-chart report

1074222
any	set
derive the class that implements your com-exposed interface from isupporterrorinfoimpl call seterrorinfo to set the detailed explanation of the error if any occurs

margins	padding
if you remove the content from a div it may be hidden completely with margins and padding in some brwosers but stay visible with both margins and padding in the others

1074230
union-all	union
union-all may be faster than union but possibly result in duplicates recording

1074248

1074689
keyboard	mouse
there s a company adesso that makes some nice product that integrated mouse and keyboard functionality into one

1074699
msbuild	nant
try to just invoke msbuild directly with that parameter make sure it s not an issue with your nant file

1074713
any	set
one problem that arises from this situation is that i have to give selected a timeout and expect that it ll be high enough to not cause any issues with polling a rather large set of descriptors while low enough not to introduce too much latency into my timing event-loop - although i do understand that if there is actual i o set membership detected in the polling process selected will return early which partly mitigates the problem

1074732
declarative	imperative
msbuild properties evaluation is pretty complex since it mixes declarative and imperative styles

1074740
export	report
then simply add the field to the report detail section and format it .so that it export properly to excel

now question is is there .some kind of attributes i might be able to tag the parentroom properties .so that it knows that is refers to the parentroominner properties and therefore can know how to handle it .when breaking down the expression

1074815
32-bit	64bit
the ia-32 s fpu is 80bit internally - 32-bit and 64bit floats are expanded to 80bit on load and reduced on store

1074815
32-bit	64bit
there s also simd which can do four 32-bit floats or two 64bit floats in parallels

1074818
double	int
although the hash of the double are int the double could mess up the hash

1074835

i ve tried adding a modelstate properties to attributes but this data does not appear to be available to pass into the attributes

1074845

alternatives would as you mentioned be direct3d or you could consider regular gdi with systemd call

1074845
direct3d	gdi
gdi can be relatively easy once you figure out the basic direct3d is a bit more complex

1074853
base-class	inherited
since perl 5.10 has introduced the does concept which is about as lightweight a x compatible object inherited from a base-class object compatible which implements a base does by looking through isa for and replying to the affirmative for anything in there

how do i find a repository if any that contains this artifact

1074987
artifactory	nexus
another alternative is to use a maven repository manager like nexus or artifactory to manage maven s integration with external repositories though that is almost certainly too much information if you re just starting out

1074991
value	field
use default value on the database i would strongly urge to use the built-in default constraint that s available on any field

1075002

1075043
selected	button
under window- preferences- xml- xml catalog selected user specified entries and then the add button

1075049
worksheet	excel
even with your printrange sub declare as public you still need to refer to it more specifically .so that excel can find it because you have put it in the code section of a worksheet instead of a module

1075049
worksheet	excel
a caution if you have renamed your worksheet on the page tab to shtpage but in the vba project explorer excel still refers to the worksheet as sheet1 shtpage you will need to use the sheet1 named that excel recognizes not the shtpage named that appears on the page tab

1075055
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i personally use argumentexception or argumentnullexception in conjunction with testing parameters passed to routines like this

1075055
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i would recommend using argumentexception or argumentnullexception for parameters passed to routines rather then local-variables

1075184
malloc	free
others have answered the question as written but i d like to suggest sticking with malloc free for such allocation

1075184
malloc	free
if you know that you just need an arbitrary block of memory using malloc and free is perfectly reasonable

.so to authentication get user from database with supplied username then generator the same hash using the passwd provided via their login attempt and compare to that in the database

1075187
any	set
is there any way to remove the submithandler or invalidhandler once they are set

1075195
value	field
you can use the new sqlvariant field for the value rather than a varchar - it can hold any of the regular data typess - you will need to add support for casting them to the correct data types .when using the value though

1075202
order	add
you will need to add an int field that stores the sort order of the email addresses

1075210
32-bit	64bit
there will be two sets of odbc data sources dsn now 32-bit and 64bit

1075210
32-bit	64bit
.some databases don t currently have updates drivers for 64bit .so you will be forced to use the 32-bit drivers or you can just wait

1075211
arrays	map
i use std vector .when i need a collections of stuff and std map .when i need an associativity arrays

1075216
ruby-on-rails	grails
there are several things that haven t really translation from the ruby-on-rails grails world

1075219
32-bit	64bit
the vendor did not offer a 64bit versioning .so we had to target 32-bit development

1075232
persistent	transient
.when nhibernate checked whether the child is transient the triggers responds that it is transient and a save happens which marks the child as persistent

1075253

bmp	png
also note that without compression also image-size is just 30kb for rgb image and if you reduce size to 60x60 pixels image-size would be only 10kb without any compression i.e you can use bmp images and if you want lesses sizer but lossless-compression you can choose png

1075294
sql-server	ms-access
following podcast #59 i ve been considering moving some images from an ms-access db into ms sql-server it s the only piece i haven t migrate over yet

1075294

1075363
32-bit	x86	32-bit	64bit	64bit	x86
is there a way to execute a .net application compiled under anycpu as a 32-bit application .when running in a 64bit windows environment without recompiling as x86

1075367
attributes	properties
if you look at the properties accessor in the generator code in settings.cs you ll see that they re marked with an attributes contains the default-value of the setting that s in your app-config file. if you change a setting by editing the app-config file directly settings.cs won t be updates but the new value will still be used by your program .when you run it because app-config gets copy-paste to foo.exe.config at compile-time

1075397
publishing	release
in the flash ide that means publishing with the permit debugging option unchecked whereas in flex builder it means export release build.

1075409
order	add
instead i was thinking is there a way to add order to this function

1075423
hide	show
in the past the way i ve handled this is to have the user not leave the login page and have an asp.net panels show itself with the oh hey you need to change your passwd bit and hide the rest of the page

1075423
change-password	login	change-password	authentication	authentication	login
if i have it .post to another actionview then i run the risk of either having to login the user or have the change-password page be not protected by authentication since unlike the change-password bit you get provided with i don t want them to be authentication .when they see the page

1075424
32-bit	64bit
the arrays of pointers will take up which is generally 320000 bytes on a 32-bit systemd or 640000 bytes on a 64bit systemd

1075426
websphere	ibm
ibm seems to frequently reorganize its website .so the above link might not work if you checked back here after a long while but the supportpac can be found easily by doing a search for saveqmgr on the websphere mq page

1075439
order	add
you could of course add order by simply numbering the urls

1075444
malloc	free
you should also take care of declaring such large arrays if you need big arrays you should use malloc free otherwise you will exhaust your stack

1075470
wordpress	blogs
i have created 5-10 wordpress blogs and customized functionality

1075476
authentication	login
forms-authentication will checked if user is authentication if it founds user not logged and your asp.net page demands authentication then forms-authentication will redirect the user to the login page specified in web-config s forms-authentication section

1075576
oracle	mysql
mysql doesn t have the database link feature that oracle has

1075580

reflection	runtime
reflection has to go at runtime and determine what properties etc

1075706
udp	tcp
my program runs fine locally but overseas sites are having issues and i am wondering if sql might be using a tcp or udp ports that is still blocked

1075739
icmp	tcp	packets	ping
as far as i understand your question you are asking whether icmp ping packets which returns guarantees you can open a connection on a particular tcp ports

1075739

it was not how i wanted to do it but because i needed to fix this and move on i put a hidden textbox on the form and as soon as i see the character that signals the possible start of the string of data i want to capture i set focus to that textbox and respond to the textchanged event

1075784
removeclass	addclass
following that with yet another operators and passing that operators the string removeclass or addclass gets you the removeclass or addclass jquery methods

1075790

if it s not sorted but the order needs to be preserve then you could have a separate which would contains the index for each elements

1075801
webforms	asp.net
there is no readonly properties for a true dropdownlistfor for asp.net webforms

1075817
duplicates	sorted
if you care about duplicates you will need some sort of sorted multiset

1075819
updating	updates
insert and updates are a little trickier because updating multiple facts required updating multiple rows not multiple-columns

1075824
realloc	malloc
realloc should be used for memory allocated with malloc - like functions

1075832
advanced-installer	installshield
installshield wix wise advanced-installer etc

1075870
removeclass	addclass
addclass removeclass step

i am using a datagrid in expression-blend but i just need to show only the registries and hide the columnheader

1075911
panels	grid
grid panels in wpf

1075911
panels	grid
iâ m struggling whether to use grid or canvas panels for all my forms

1075911
panels	grid	base-class	inherited
i will have base-class that inherited windows class for all windowss .so designer in visual-studio will be useless since it has issues for this .sort of inheriting and with grid panels i donâ t really even need designer and i can set windows sizetocontent .so everything will fit just fine

1075922
any	set
assuming the original string is split up by whitespace as your example showed you can just split the string on any whitespace and set a flag .when you are between a start and end token to put pipe between tokens instead of newline

1075928
linux	unix
flexlm is pretty much the de-facto software licence manager for commercial software particularly on linux unix

service .so if it isn t an object entity nor belong to repository factory then its a service

1076000
authentication	login
i would instead tie the display of the page to the customer s authentication credentials providing you required your users to login

1076000
authentication	login
if the customer tries to access a .profile page other than their own they redirected to the login page or given an access authentication error messages

1076002
getter	setter
use the properties - any logic that may be encapsulated within the setter and getter ought to apply even within the class itself

1076002
getter	setter
if there is no logic within the getter and setter it is still not safe to use the field themselves because if at any points you wish to add logic around the access to those field you will have to refactor much more

1076020
data-members	instances
there may be instances in which we want to directly access the underlying data-members but then that is a conscious decision with a specific reason and it tends to be the exception-handling

1076031
dump	temp
i have a list of files .sourcefile object which just contains the filename only then i want to pull those specific files out of a zip and dump them into a temp directory .so i can distribute them later

1076044
arrays	loops
you re going out of the bounds of your arrays because your loops conditional is too large

1076044
arrays	loops
a more traditional approach would be to bound loops by the size of the arrays

1076056
template-engine	velocity
perhaps you should be using a template-engine freemarker velocity stringtemplate etc... instead of jsps

1076070
export	report
right now .when the users click the export button the dialog default to saving the report as a crystal-reports formatted file

1076070
export	report
it s possible to change the selector to pdf but the specific request that i ve been given -- and i ve searched for too many hours trying to find -- is to make the export report dialog default to pdf format option

1076072
mapping	unique
the easiest and safest way to do this would be to create lookup table with a mapping from the customer id to a unique random string

1076076
contains	set
in php i can use the strpbrk function to determine if a certain string contains a certain set of characters

1076108
slidedown	slideup
how about the slidedown and slideup methods

1076126
base-class	inherited
errors are a under a different inherited hierarchy than exception-handling though both shared the base-class throwable

1076133
directory	folder
you can set webcontent as the content directory main java and main resources as java source folder and you can add the jars from .libs to the buildpath or simply put them in the webcontent web-inf .lib directory

1076133
buildpath	libs
i would put the normals and compile libs to the buildpath of the project and add the test libs explicit to the classpath of a test run configuration

1076170
constructor	object
you will always get a new object that way unless as others pointed out an exception-handling is throw in the constructor

1076178
constructor	object
if the constructor for thing throw an exception-handling the object isn t created

1076187
.net	wcf
they may not have any knowledge of wcf or even use .net

1076190
32-bit	64bit
i m porting my application from 32-bit to 64bit

1076190
32-bit	64bit
i should also add that my concern isn t that the results aren t identical it s that porting to a 64bit platform has uncovered a 32-bit dependency of which i was not aware

1076191
lazy-evaluation	maybe
since the stack-trace on an exception-handling is lazy-evaluation loaded i thought maybe there is a instruction reordering issue of some sort and decided to call e.getstacktrace before the log statement

1076205
version-control	cvs
i had experience with cvs and other version-control systemd i was familiar with the concepts but i found the clearcase documentation incomprehensible and had to ask for help several time

1076218
32-bit	64bit
there is no inherent need for floats and double to behave differently between 32-bit and 64bit code but frequently they do

1076218
32-bit	x86	compatibility	platform
on intel x86 platform 32-bit code often uses the x87 co-processor instruction set and floating-point register stack for maximum compatibility whereas on amb64 x86_64 platform the sse instructions and xmm registers and are often used instead

1076220
compatibility	platform
your compiler is probably using sse opcodes to do most of its floating-point arithmetic on the 64bit platform assuming x86-64 whereas for compatibility reasons it probably used the fpu before for a lot of its operations

1076220
32-bit	64bit
sse opcodes offer a lot more registers and consistency value always remain 32-bit or 64bit in size while the fpu uses 80 bit intermediate value .when possible

1076220
32-bit	64bit
you may try to use -mfpmath 387 for your 64bit versioning since you are compiling with gcc and see if your results match your 32-bit results to help narrow this down

1076221
spring	guice
is it just a case of creating the spring context and then using the spring-integration to suck in the spring beans into a guice context

1076252

1076362
click	mouse
checked and unchecked the checkedbox .when it is the column header is click only if the mouse click is within the bounds of the checkedbox

1076362
updating	updates
implements the check-all uncheck-all outside of the derived-class by listening to the checkedchanged event updating the underlying data object and then calling resetbindings to updates the datagridview

1076404
aspect-ratio	scale
if you don t let the user choose a region of the right aspect-ratio then the image will be squished .when you scale it down

1076414
32-bit	64bit
is there some sort of c# directive to use .when using a development machine 32-bit or 64bit that says something to the effect of

1076418
selected	listbox
my favorite solution is to create an attached properties on your listbox that then bind to an observablecollection which contains your selected items

1076434
contains	elements
.so if you are performing this in an event receiver you need to concatenation a string contains the elements needed

1076436
spring	seam
it stands to reason that if you seam uses spring then the spring jars should already be there

1076443
google-chrome	firefox
the website currently is not running well in ie8 firefox google-chrome

1076444
sqldatasource	gridview
working on setting up a sqldatasource connecting mysql database to a asp.net gridview

from there you should be able to set the active solution platform and create configuration that specifically target x64 x86 or any cpu

1076458
32-bit	64bit
i am not sure if this is what you are looking for but i checked the intptr.size to detection 32-bit versus 64bit runtime

1076460
data-access	nhibernate
how many data-access solutions have microsoft created and killed off in the time that hibernate nhibernate have been around

1076461
32-bit	64bit
what i use in my c# code is intptr.size it equals 4 on 32-bit and 8 on 64bit

1076464
updating	updates
kind of clunky but it does allow your css developers to updates the themerolled themes and you don t have to worry about updating any of your code anymore

1076469
object-reference	instances
this is because under the covers events are delegation and delegation to instances methodss are a combinations of the object-reference and the actual methods

1076477
32-bit	64bit
it is not fair to characterize the changes as anything but different. perhaps there is an increased emotional attachment to the older results...but there is no mathematical reason to prefer the 32-bit results over the 64bit results

1076477
32-bit	64bit
as a quick test move the binary from the 32-bit systemd to the 64bit systemd and run it

1076477
32-bit	64bit
then rebuild the .app on the 64bit systemd as a 32-bit binary and run that

1076479
constructor	object
several people are saying that an object won t be created if the constructor throw an exception-handling

1076480
.net	wcf
i am working with wcf .net 3.5 sp1 and have read that one does not have to decorator their entities collections with such things as data-members dataconract and or serialization

1076484
textbox	button
i want to have one control that combines a textblock a textbox and a button that launchd a common fileopen dialog

1076515
contains	any
i believe it s also possible for the table named to be back-tick quoted in case it contains any funny characters i may be wrong about that though

1076542
contains	any
in php strpbrk searches to see if the django-haystack contains any of the chars in the char_list

1076552

1076632
getter	setter
do you have getter setter for the properties unvanid

1076635
updating	updates
.so we need to notify the user-interface-thread that we want to updates .so that updates can be handled in a thread safe manner this means that the background-thread updating object can not simply go about its business it has to ask permission to updates the object or ask the user-interface to make the changes to the object on its behalf

1076644
any	set
we could mandate that callers set a particular global variables maybe also thread-local prior to calling any function in utilities.dll

1076652
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
am i correct in assuming that if you have an object that is contains inside a java set or as a key in a map for that matter any field that are used to determine identity or relation via hashcode equals comparator etc. cannot be changed without causing unspecified-behavior for operations on the collections

1076656
administration	account

1076704
selection	cell
the long touches resulted in cell selection and image animation and the short ones resulted in cell selection without animation

1076730
constructor	object
i just realized something crazy which i assumed to be completely impossible .when deserializing an object the datacontractserializer doesn t call the constructor

1076730
constructor	object
i have absolutely no idea how it is possible since it is the only constructor for this object

1076751
reflection	runtime
casts can be done as int comparisons within the runtime but reflection involves full methods call

1076795
debugging	trace
if your kung fu is strong you can even use it to debugging trace any application across tiers and layer

1076798
subclassing	metaclass
if you want to make absolutely sure that subclassinging of a overrides size you could use a metaclass for a that will raise an error .when a subclassing does not overrides it note that a is a new-style class here

1076818
postgresql	mysql
the requirements for the project i m working seem to points to using both a relational-database postgresql mysql in combinations with a key-value store hbase cassandra

1076898
contains	set
permissible for a set to contains

1076913
streamreader	streamwriter
i have just used the streamwriter streamreader classes and it is quite fast actually

1076920
keyboard	mouse
the job of gtk_main is pump events -- it detection low-level events such as keyboard mouse input and os timers converts them to higher-level events and passes those onto the application code

1076944
short	base
if you want short urls and predictability is not a concern you can convert the auto-incrementing id to a higher base

1076950
entity-framework	ado.net
but personally i prefer the entity-framework ado.net entities are supported by default and can be updates with a simple right-mouse click

1076971

i m using the latest versioning of the quicktime sdk and want to have the audio from the .movie they are referenced as .movie but can be mp3 m4a .mov and other filetypes played through specific audio devices if the user has more than one audio device

1077032
value	field
.when you updates an event object you have to make sure that the new value are valid not only for the field but the context you re putting them in

1077047
post-increment	pre-increment
the reason behind the pre-increment being faster is that post-increment has to make a copy of the old value to return

1077047
post-increment	pre-increment
as gotw #2 put it pre-increment is more efficient than post-increment because for post-increment the object must increment itself and then return a temporary contains its old value

1077047
post-increment	pre-increment
gotw #55 provides the canonical form of post-increment which show that it has to do pre-increment plus some more work

1077056
profiling	debugging
it is freeware and very good for quick debugging and profiling

1077059
temporary	copy
there is a chance that it++ will create a temporary copy

1077059
temporary	copy
the temporary copy in particular will be optimized away by most compilers since there are no side-effects in the 3rd expression of your for-loop

1077078
updatepanel	ascx
my ascx control inside a containers updatepanel does a full page-refresh .when one of the controls inside it is click

1077085
factors	matrix
since you are using a matrix overrides the get and set matrix functions set the scaling factors with your new functions and set them to not scale before calling super

1077097

1077129
management-studio-express	ssms
the ssms tools pack add-in add-on for microsoft sql-server management studio and microsoft sql-server management-studio-express will do exactly what you need

1077140
opacity	shadow
it uses the backbuffer s alpha channel for opacity effectively bringing out all the shadow information inscribed earlier

1077145
droppable	draggable
here is a example that does some other thing but makes use of droppable and draggable object maybe it can help you understand how it works

1077166
javascript	dom
if you need to reference the elements later simply pass the reference to another function--all object in javascript are passed by reference .so working on that floating dom elements from within another function modifies the original not a copy

1077171
display	height
for the life of me i can t figure out how to make the footer always display correctly using css regardless of sidebar height

1077207
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
btree sortedlist insert special nodes in the sorteddictionary could all be useful

1077219
margins	padding
you can use padding to get a tight border without setting the h1 as inline which can t be centered using automatic margins

1077227
order	add
what would be the best way to add product to an order

1077227
order	add
the only way i can think is to add another field to order called product and fill it with a csv with a sku for each product in it

1077235
any	set
taking dom level 3 as our source and assuming that by dom id you mean an attributes with the id flag set then the value is a domstring the characters of which can be any utf-16 encodable character

1077242
perl	awk
perl probably would have been a better choice than awk but here goes first we sort the two city named and put the id at the end of the string which i did in the first section

1077248
difference	count
.so what you can do is you can count the numbers of recording before the import and after the import and then selected the difference like .so

1077292
positioning	sidebar
if your sidebar is absolutely positioning then you could be having a bit more fun here s a good resource for other layout

1077312
document	editing
you re best bet for office document would probably be to start with ooxml summary field editing and seeing if you want to continue with other formats from there

1077321
any	set
another way is to stash any view controllers you are drilling down to as class local-variables - then in viewwillappear you know you were hit because of a drill-up if any of the class local-variables are still set

1077325
getter	setter
resig s .post references his env.js implementation being the first time he uses the getter and setter methodology you are looking for

1077325
getter	setter
to handle browser compatibility as well as focusing on an aspects that javascript does very well use closures for your getter and setter methods to protect object properties

1077330
haskell	python
python cookbook has generator-wrappers written that perform the same functionality as take takewhile and drop in haskell

however i ve run into a snag .when trying to query mbeans for specific caching within a cluster which is where i can find stats about total numbers of gets puts average time for each etc

1077377
keyboard	mouse
using the keyboard to browse through large source code is much easier than manually scrolling through text highlight text and fumbling through an ide with a mouse

1077380
swing	awt
i haven t tried it before but swing is built on top of awt and the robot class had a way of sampling specific pixels in the awt

1077400
widget	popup
the tooltip created are not linked to the dialog popup directly - they re not created as child widget of the popup

1077400
dictionary	arrays
depending on your code structure to avoid problems later on you may want to make the errormessagetooltips dictionary specific to the popup and not a global arrays

1077411
synchronous	.when
my problem is that .when i bind to text and id on this control i want their data to be populate synchronous .so that .when a propertieschanged event fires on either properties both of them have updates data

1077428
keyboard	mouse	click	mouse
currently i could use mouse click to choose the selection i d like to add keyboard control to allow autocomplete control

1077431
low-level	hardware
this is true however the iphone s apis are still somewhat limited in the way of low-level hardware access backgrounding only notifications in 3.0 etc

1077436
boost-python	ctypes
in my experience it is much better than boost-python swig or ctypes

1077450
digits	short
i m no crypto expert but as long as you checked for brute-forcing attempts you should be able to use a short key like gmail s 6 digits

1077465
derived-class	base-class
this will ensure the destructor for both the base-class and the derived-class is called .when the derived-class is destroy

1077477

1077481
parsing	comma
updates i tried passing in a comma within the value and it basically just makes it impossible to actually parsing the key-value pair using string-parsing

1077488
python	c++
it s the tool riverbank .software developed to make pyqt the python interface to the wonderful qt c++ cross-platform framework -- .so it s a natural choice if your c++ code uses any qt functionality just like boost-python is the natural choice if your c++ code uses boost

1077488
perl	tcl	perl	c++	python	tcl	python	c++	python	perl	python	java
- and has the theoretical advantage that it can also wrap c or c++ code for use from java perl tcl etc -- but if you only care about python it s hard to see anything to make it stand out

1077488
python	c++
if you re just wrapping an existing dll .so besides cython which other answers have pointsed out and i endorse but -- it s changing very fast these days .so take care if you need .something more stable consider the standards function module ctypes -- i wouldn t use it for very extensive work oops errors that a c or c++ compiler would points out to you can cause runtime crash with ctypes but for small jobs it s great and very handy since it comes with standards python distributions

1077489
put	get
rest organizes a web application into resources like a twitter user or a flickr image and then uses the http verbs of .post put get and delete to create updates read and delete those resources

1077489

online example rendering neatly in firefox google-chrome safari and ie

1077503
callback	methods
yes you can have callback to methods like this

1077513
subclassing	metaclass
of course this way you ll get the error only .when an instances of a subclassing of a which doesn t overrides size actually tries to use self.size the metaclass approach has the advantage of giving the error earlier .when an errant subclassing of a is created

1077515
contains	elements
an inline level elements is contains within a block level elements and can span multiple line and does not have to defined a rectangular region

you must also tell the intermediate step about .when and show to go to previous step and next step

1077712
python	ruby	python	lua
.so everybody s urging you not to reinvent the wheel and that s a great idea i have a .soft spot for python which would allow your scripting users to al.so install and use plenty of other useful math libs c but lua s no doubt even easier to integrated and other scripting languages such as ruby would al.so no doubt be just fine

perl	php	perl	c++	python	php	python	c++	python	perl	python	java
but they re not going to program in c++ hardly at all in java maybe in python but miles away from productionized -- indeed they re far more likely to whip up a smart proof of concept in php javascript perl bash excel+vba and sundry other quick and dirty technologies we don t even want to dream about productionizing and supporting forevermore

1077859
hide	show
i see this all over the web but was wondering if anyone has the javascript code for the easiest way to show input value on blur but hide in on focus

1078336
32-bit	16-bit
shellexecute in its native is 16-bit call .so it is not intended to give feedback callback althought you can saerch thread process memory adress if you locate usable memory spaces and its flags if there would be no such a thing as bloody flags winapi 32-bit would be much simpatic than it is now

1078341

variables	boolean
suppose you have boolean local variables

1078743
cherokee	lighttpd
if instead you are having to use fastcgi scgi or ajp adaptor for a server such as lighttpd nginx or cherokee then you need to use flup package to provide a bridge between those language-agnostic interfaces and wsgi

1078774

contains	set
try starting out by defining a fraudulent transactional set as contains two or more sequential raffle codes from the same user within a set of 100 transactionalal

1078781
virtual-machine	virtualization
i think the original poster is asking how to detection that the computer hardware supports virtualization not that it is running inside a virtual-machine

1078781
processor	cpu
also it might be worth seeing if you can checked the cpu flags as there will either be the intel vmx flag or the amd svm flag if the processor supports virtualization extensions

1078785
directory	folder
if your page for example default.htm lies inside the virtual directory website1 then you can create a folder for images say images and can points to an image inside the images directory by using images image1.jpg

1078787
directory	folder
put the files in a directory that is in the same folder the html file is in

1078803
python	php
i don t know php but can give you pseudocode or eg python if you would like.

1078838
subclassing	superclass
.so does that mean the superclass should have those attributes and methods even if all the subclassing don t need them or do i defined them on the subclassing especially for attributes like variant where each subclassing has it s own list of valid value

1078838
subclassing	superclass
or given that i then end up putting all the attributes and methods on the superclass as most are shared between at least a couple of the drink types i wonder what was the points in subclassing at all

1078839
attributes	properties
note the change of properties named and their order in the attributes block

1078869

1078925
reserved-words	keyword
in practice most keyword are reserved-words and vice versa

1078925
reserved-words	keyword
but because they re two different things it may happen that a keyword is not a reserved-words a keyword only has meaning in a special context and can therefore be used as an identifier or a reserved-words is not a keyword because it is reserved for future use

1078925
reserved-words	keyword
in java goto is a reserved-words but not a keyword as a consequence you cannot use it at all

1078925
reserved-words	keyword
fortran has no reserved-words all keyword if then etc. can be used as identifier

1078935
any	set
i would suggest to not have any event handler for the click events of these button but instead set the appropriate value of their dialogresult properties and then set the modal form s acceptbutton and cancelbutton properties

1078946
reserved-words	keyword	keyword	term
are keyword and doesn t actually use the term reserved-words except once in a footnote where something else was probably meant -

1078961
reserved-words	keyword
not in all languages are all keyword reserved-words

in that case the bigdecimal should have no digits after the decimal-point and the numbers should be a mathematical int if i understand your question correctly

1078997
profiling	debugging
just like with debugging profiling is a task best done by the perl interpreter itself

1079006
getter	setter
then you could access the getter setter of your singleton from anywhere in your program

32-bit	64bit
.when trying to install my 32-bit service on a windows 64bit machine my install places the files in syswow64 directory and .when i attempt to start the service an event is written to the event-log the log show

1079251
order	add
if the order is important you can instead multiplying by a primes and add

1079264
mockito	jmock
jmock doesn t do anything special for final classes other than rely on the jdave libs to unfinalize everything in the jvm .so you could experiment with using jdave s unfinalizer and see if mockito will then mock it

1079268
turkish	locale
it works .when you debugging because the code is running as you not localsystem and i assume your locale is turkish

1079275

1079293
build-process	nant
i would like nant to send an email to some people confirming the conclusion of the build-process

1079306
linked-list	heap
stack is often also far more limited than the heap in terms of size and i d love to see a linked-list or any non-array collections of object created using the variable-length-array declaration methods -

1079313
initializer	setter
in that case it should almost certainly be a readonly properties which is initializer at creation time and not have any public setter

1079329
mouseover	mouseout
i originally started using the .live methods with mouseover and mouseout however this has massive cpu implications .when moving the mouse over the parts of the page without the grid as the event is delegated to the document mouseover

1079335
positioning	slider
without loss of generality because any solution yield a second solution with reversed order you can choose a sign for the first equation and a particular value for one of the unknowns since the whole thing can slider left and right in positioning

1079342
put	get
however .when i put exactly the same expression in the hgignore file i get this

1079354
spring	guice
it s done - use spring or guice

1079371

one important difference to a rdbms is that a graphing database won t need to lookup the relationships in a big long table like in your fixed schema .solution .so there should be a significant performance gain there

1079373
webserver	nginx
you could use a different webserver such as lighttpd or nginx

1079374
32-bit	64bit
if the machine is 64bit then the address registers or some combinations of them must be 64bit even if the general-purpose registers are 32-bit

1079377

the best looking plan would be to for each pixels draw a semi-transparent line from the new positioning to the old positioning

1079388
oracle	mysql	sql-server	oracle	sql-server	mysql
temporary tables - oracle vs sql-server mysql

1079388
oracle	mysql
transitioning from oracle to ms mysql no problem

1079395
arrays	loops
apparently the implementation of arrays_intersect testing php 5.3 does not use any optimization caching whatsoever but loops through the arrays and compares the value one by one for each elements in arrays a

1079419
value	field
if you only have access to the field as an object with no knowledge of the internals you can simply call gethashcode on each one and combine that value like .so

1079419
unsafe	out
if you wish to avoid unsafe code then you can use bit masking techniques to pull out individual bits from int and chars if dealing with strings with not too much extra hassle

1079441
javascript	dom
it s possible to call the modalpop-upextender from javascript as the modal pop-up control is just another dom elements

for instances the scala plugins compiler does not seem to like jdo enhanced java classes too much...there is a work around and i am sure this bug will be fixed soon

1079515
scala	java
the only thing i find a bit tedious about the mix is dealing with java apis that return java collections class in scala

1079530
checkbox	textbox	selected	checkbox	selected	textbox
i m talking about pretty much arbitrary things like the last splitter distance on a form the last value in a search textbox prevously selected checkbox indexes et cetera

1079530
key-value	key
it would of course not work with searching and order and things like that but that wouldn t be needed anyways since you would only access those key-value pairs directly from their index userid + source + key

been using java since the 90 s and python since 01 or .so

1079647
python	java
if you understand polymorphism you don t need duck-typing and you don t miss it .when switching between python and java

1079669
panels	grid
you ought to be able to solve this with proper use of the grid and some panels dockpanel and stackpanel can be quite useful

1079671
maven-plugin	javadoc	getter	setter
is there a maven-plugin that will automatically generator setter and getter with the corresponding javadoc

1079678
frame-rate	fps
say for example that your output frame-rate is 50 fps

1079710
credentials	security
system.componentmodel.win32exception no credentials are available in the security package

1079716
gettext	icu
i would highly recommend using icu instead of gettext and the locale stuff offered by the standard-library if you are developing a commercial application

1079731
parametric-polymorphism	polymorphism
the second kind is traditionally called parametric-polymorphism or generics polymorphism

1079745
solaris	linux
i don t know if the ibm jvm also supports this special flag but you could try adding this too which in sun jvm seems to be specific for some problems with signals handler under linux solaris

1079745
solaris	linux
jdk 6 hotspot viewmodel - signal-handling on solaris os and linux

1079745
signals	sigint
signals masks for sigint sigterm

1079752
instances	private
to clarify i mean should there only be a single boolean state within an inherited heirarchy that defined whether an object instances has been dispose or should there be a private boolean at each step of the inherited ladder

1079753
highlight	cell
i m writing a scripting to highlight table cell across multiple tables in a calendar

1079753
contains	elements
however highlight only works within the table contains the elements being hovered over

1079753
highlight	cell
what i want to happen is for the adjacent cell to be highlight as well

1079753
highlight	cell
this could be expanded .so the next 7 cell are highlight as well for example

1079753
highlight	cell
if i hover over the cell contains 31 the other cell to highlight are going to be in another table contains the next month

1079764
abstract	extends
plus you can add this methods to an abstract model that all your application model would extends and then only overwrite them .when you need to do something special

1079767
getter	setter	protected	public
i would recommend having a dispose properties on the base-class with a public getter and a protected setter

1079802
profiling	trace
have you used a profiling to trace the performance problems to your use of an inversion-of-control framework

1079804
unit-testing	expectations
unless it s explicit mentioned in a contract there shouldn t be an expectations that unit-testing will be used for a product

1079808
dlopen	dlsym
to avoid this i have replace the api call with function-pointers obtained using dlsym and dlopen

1079808
dlopen	dlsym
am i missing something while using dlsym and dlopen

1079822
constructor	object
.when an object is resolved from an inversion-of-control containers typically the containers will use reflection to scan that class s constructor and public properties and then loops through some internal collections to find the best match for each service that object required

1079830
required	checked
you would checked at runtime for the existence of methods or properties that are required to fulfill your needs regardless of inherited hierarchies

1079830
python	ruby	python	java
it loses much of the simplicity of duck-typing in python or ruby or javascript but its actually pretty good practice in java if you re looking for a high level of reusability

1079878
order	add
if i am writing an implementation of linkedhashset and one test tests that after insert a duplicates the original is in the same iterator order as before the insert i might want to add a separate test that the duplicates is not in the set at all

1079915
any	set
any class can now arbitrarily set the dispose properties to true without disposing anything

1079919
getter	setter
.when an event is dispatchen the main class either does something or retrives a variables or sets a variables in the loaded swf with the getter or setter function

1079926
constructor	object
now you can convert the classes one at a time to take the configuration object in through their constructor to complete stage 2

1079926
dependency-injection	singleton	dependency-injection	inject
on the other hand you can ignore the refactoring of the usages and simply inject a mocked configuration class into the singleton wrapper for testing - essentially a poor man s dependency-injection

1079929
calloc	malloc
you could also use calloc instead of malloc since calloc gives you zeroed memory

1079933
base-class	inherited
where i inherited from the base-class that uses these attributes

1079935
buffering	streaming
using netstreaming to streaming content from http i ve noticed that esp with certain exported h.264 s if the player encounters an empty buffering it will stop and buffering to the requested length as expected

1079935
buffering	streaming
i ve attempted to work around this by listening for an empty buffering netstatus event pausing the streaming and at the same time setting up a loops to checked the current buffering length vs the requested buffering length

1079935
buffering	streaming
if you add the .net streaming current time index plus the buffering time the total is not the entire duration of the movie .when at the end

1079935
.when	ready
this brings me back to the original problem and if there is another way to fix this clearly flash knows .when the buffering is ready .so how can i get flash pause .when it bufferinging and resume once the buffering is ready

1079940
onresume	onpause
in any case you ll definitely want to move the acquire and release methods into onresume and onpause respectively

1079940
onresume	onpause
your best bet is to construct the wakelock in oncreate as you have acquire the lock in onresume and release it in onpause including the call to isheld

1079944
objectdisposedexception	nullreferenceexception
other methods that attempt to use _comobject after dispose will get a nullreferenceexception or ideally those methods would checked the _comobject field and throw objectdisposedexception

1079946
value	field
that said the serialization string you provided only appears to be storing ids - field named rather than any value .so i m not sure what s going on there

1079957
expression	evaluation
this will blow up since it doesn t know what to do with the facade properties .when evaluation the expression

1079957
attributes	properties
.so it would be nice if there were an attributes or .some way to stop the entity assembly from seeing ie blocked by intellisense the outward facing properties

1079959
linux	unix
one thing i can say with complete certainty is that you don t want to be using windows because ruby-on-rails work best on a linux unix stack

1079978
vsts	tfs
in tfs 2005 and .when you open from the client side from vsts the source-control-explorer and you create a workspace

1079983
python	php	python	java
python is the language i know the most and strangely i still don t know why i m typing self and not this like in java or php

1079983
python	java
i know that python is older than java but i can t figure out where does this come from

1080019
g++	gcc
any .l files will get passed through flex and gcc any .y files will get passed through bison and g++ and any .cpp files through just g++

1080039
plugins	add-on
any plugins add-on

1080047
puts	gets
three specific issues i can think of are efficiency of your gets and puts write contention and exploding indexes

1080065
put	get
i d say that the workflow of sign up get email click on link in email is now fairly ubiquitous and wouldn t put off the majority of users

1080070
perl	ruby	python	ruby	python	perl	python	java
you can also use the perl python ruby binding or svnkit java to accomplish this task but i cannot provide sourcecode for this

1080090
logfile	tail
if the application crash illegal memory reference etc. windows nastily chops off the logfile before the tail end of the commentary .so we can t see what was occuring at the points of the crash

1080103
versioning	upgrade
the force is to upgrade older versioning

1080110
boolean	int
how does the industry refer to storing mulitple boolean value state in one int

1080136
bitarray	bitset
bitset or bitarray

1080149
lookup	any
one would like to be able to perform lookup and other work in the news reader process the incoming feed on the basis of any extra information found and then present the massaged job information to the user

1080153
.when	ready
.so you will need to adjust your submit handler and unset form_state storage .when are ready to save value to the database etc

1080166
firefox	opera
for me your code works without problems in ie6 firefox 3.0.11 and opera 9.64

1080192
python	ruby
modula-3 1988 python late 1980s and ruby mid 1990s also follow this tradition

1080243
radio	click
the problem with using the click event instead of change is you get the event if the same radio box is selected hasn t actually changed

1080243
radio	click
if you call blur in the click event it ll cause the change event to fire only if the radio boxes actually have a changed

1080256
ternary-operator	operands
is a ternary-operator which means that it has three operands

1080274
uisearchbar	uitableview
i ve got a uitableview with a uisearchbar as the tableviews.tableheaderview

1080331
exception-handling	try-catch
you should put a try-catch block around the code having the problem catch the exception-handling in for instances ex then .post the result-of ex.tostring

1080337
licensing	lgpl	licensing	gpl	lgpl	gpl
as for licensing it offers a choice of gpl lgpl and mpl

1080374
value	field
i have a report in report service and there is a grouping that is based around a field value

1080386
windows-server	windows
even this can triggers a file replacement error if you try to overwrite a systemd protected file on newer versioning of windows featuring windows resource protection wikipedia windows-server 2008 and vista onwards

1080388
grouping	sorting
edit your grouping and go to the sorting tab

1080409
python	java
know python java well

1080409

tried my hands at lisp ruby haskell

1080424
submitchanges	datacontext
.when the form is submitted you can call submitchanges on the datacontext

1080448
derived-class	base-class
what is a common practice for the storage of a list of base-class pointers each of which can describe a polymorphism derived-class

1080458
constructor	object
moveover .some of the newer object depend on others .so i m getting .some kind of spaggetti initialization where object are created then passed to other constructor

1080461
linux	unix
and like other post earlier peak memory usage of a linux unix process time -v doesn t seem to report memory for my machine.

1080483
selected	checkbox
selected checkbox and then delete the datagrid column

1080488
listboxitem	dockpanel
bind the width of the dockpanel to the actualwidth of the listboxitem

1080502
constructor	object
how could i tell seam to use an arguments in the constructor .when initializer an object to be inject

1080506
32-bit	64bit
64bit versioning of windows contains a sub-system for 32-bit executable

1080506
32-bit	64bit
if 7 is 64bit and your .app is 32-bit it is possible you and your .app are not looking at the same registry hives - .when you run regedit you re watching the main 64bit registry

1080510
versioning	upgrade
you should be on the very latest versioning of ruby-on-rails and upgrade frequently

1080522
constructor	object
on the constructor of that class create all other object

1080522
constructor	object
whatever object that needs any other object should receive said object as a parameter on its constructor

1080522
constructor	object
no one no absolutely any other object should create anything on their constructor

1080526
windows-mobile	symbian
i wish to have something working for android windows-mobile symbian and blackberry

1080532
firefox	safari
both safari mac and firefox mac move cursor at the very beginning .when iâ m pressing the arrow up key

1080535
msbuild	nant
if you prefer nant msbuild or powershell you can use those too.

1080573
windows-mobile	symbian
symbian and windows-mobile are likely even worse

1080595
dictionary	arrays
be them simple strings arrays dictionary or dozens of other methods - the basic concept here is using simple descriptive words in the code for the programmers reference - the user is and should be completely unaware of this coding conventions

1080599
constructor	object
pass the mediator into the constructor of each object

1080628
g++	gcc
cc gcc -m32 cxx g++ -m32 linux32 rpmbuild -bb -target i586 package.spec

1080639
value	field
due to above properties the custom field s value for this current listitem will be stored as spfielduservalue e.g 27#

1080639
value	field
i have hardcode this anchor tag within the default case-statement of a switching under displaypatteren but it show me the field value on allitems.aspx as

1080640
glut	sdl
i could try using glut or sdl but i m not sure i want to include those as dependencies.

1080644
subtraction	addition
i d like to have a class a with a for example sortedlist collections srtdlst properties and inside this class a allow the addition or subtraction of srtdlst items

1080644
subtract	add
but in a instances of the class a only allow to get or set the content of the items not to add new items or subtract the existing ones

1080668
arrays	loops
either allocate 121 hexpieces in the originaly arrays or use in loops to avoid the error

1080672
value	field
use that derived-class as the types of the field that stores the properties value

1080672
key-value	key
from your comment i think you mean that you want to allow assignment to the value of an existing key-value pair but disallow assignment to a previously unknown key

1080685
printf	atoi
but what i recommend you do is atoi their input and then printf cmd levelplayer.exe 03d lvlinput_as_integer

1080696
multiplication	mod
instead of using to do your powers i would do a for-loop using multiplication and then taking the mod of the numbers as you go along by using a conditional to checked if the numbers calculated is greater than the mod

1080721
jquery	.post
and the jquery .post call

1080722
search-engine	seo
its mostly a human reliability issue although since most search-engine ranking algorithms are not publically disclosed it is believed to have seo value as well

1080724
instances	self
class methods are always bound to and operate on the class not the instances which is why their first arguments is usually called cls not self

1080742
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
only firefox 3.5 safari all versioning and google-chrome 2+ support it

1080742
internet-explorer	safari	internet-explorer	firefox	internet-explorer	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the article says it works in ie only however it works in google-chrome 3 what i m using firefox 3.5 internet-explorer and safari

1080753
getter	setter
i can make the setter or getter private internal

1080769
n-gram	words
instead of writing another n-gram search or improving the one in whoosh we now keep a words index retrieve all entries that have at least one correctly spelled words in common with the query and use difflib to rank those

1080775
getter	setter
you can t create truly readonly properties because you have to defined both setter and getter

1080776
ref	out
just edges cases like where you need to pass a properties to a methods where the parameter is passed by reference ref or out which isn t possible with a properties because internally they re just get_properties set_properties methodss implements by the compiler not special field of some kind and you would need an explicit private backing field for this

1080779
any	set
if you don t need to perform any specific logic in the get and or set accessor there s no disadvantage.

1080792
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
i want to rotate a single words of text by 90 degrees with cross-browser ie6 firefox 2 any versioning of google-chrome safari or opera support

1080803
javascript	dom
i often find myself wanting to debugging css layout issues that involve dom changes caused by javascript in reaction to a hover event or different css rules applying due to the hover selector

1080803
javascript	dom
however .when hovering is involved it becomes impossible because as soon as you move your mousedown to the firebug panels the elements you re interested in are no longer hovered the css rules that apply are different and in the case of javascript hovers the dom is changed

1080812
firefox	safari
for firefox 3.5 or safari webkit 3.1 checkout -moz-transform and -webkit-transform

1080823
xcopy	cmd
this suggests wrapping xcopy with cmd c

1080826
mta	sta
you did create two instances of the object from two mta threads but the object itself will run on a single com ole created sta

1080826
mta	sta
instances of sta object from mta threads com will create a separate unmanaged thread and initializer it as sta this is called the

1080826
mta	sta
default sta all call to sta object from mta threads will be marshalling and incur thread switches in some cases idispatch call

1080836
.when	ready
the scheduling will then be activated even before a hardware interrupt which is also what happens .when a process tries to do a blocking read from a streaming that has no data ready to be read and the os makes a note of what the process is waiting for

1080868
version-control	git
if you would like to see how git compares to other version-control systemd there is no better suited site than this one why git is better than x coincidentally that site s source is on github

1080868
version-control	git
i think most developers are beginning to move to a distribute version-control systemd like git or mercurial and it seems like more are joining the git camp which will most likely mean that you will find more guides tools etc

1080885
any	set
and no i didn t need to set any flags to get and to match line boundaries since i m implements this in ruby.

1080904
lookup	any
i would like to lookup an enum from its string value or possibly any other value

1080909
haskell	ada	haskell	fortran	haskell	c++	fortran	ada
i m talking about things like mixing c++ with fortran or ada with haskell etc

1080919
sharpziplib	dotnetzip
in the past i ve used dotnetzip ms-pl sharpziplib gpl and the 7zip sdk for c# public domain

1080934
getter	setter
properties are really just two methods a getter and a setter of types and .so you have to write different things do deal with the setter and the getter

1080959
filtering	sorting
it s offline in the sense that it is self-contained that html is carefully generator and the javascript inside it is carefully crafted to allow the user to browse thousands of images sorting or filtering by a numbers of criterion

1080966
ruby	php	python	ruby	python	php
the web application then is written in a language that might be c# ruby r.o.r. python php or anything else that is good for the job

1080966
python	c++
that s why for example i use c++ for my home-made game because i know it best i could use a lot of other languages as the targets are win mac linux not consoles but i use python for everything related to build-process file manipulation etc

1080966
python	c++
i don t know python in depth but it s fare easier to do quick file manipulation with it than with c++

1080980
c++	lua
for instances in games which are pretty hardcore applications you usually have a very tight c++ engine that does all the heavy lifting and a scripting-language such as lua that s accessible and suited for making that collections of special cases that we call game happen

1080981
put	get
.so i m willing to put the effort in now to get it set up right for the long term

1080984
instances	self
each class in the module must have typically in __init__ a call _register self to register new instances

1080995
virtual-functions	base-class	virtual-functions	derived-class	derived-class	base-class
important points - if you derive a class from a base but the derived-class does not overrides any virtual-functions or add any new virtual-functions then the compiler could conceivably reuse the base-class s vtable for the derived-class

1081001
.when	ready
you can modify the plugins probably binding the call to other event but this is not a very good idea or just create the div from php to be there .when ready is called

1081007
directory	folder
i say to some extent because for some odd reason the microsoft demo .app display blank file and folder named though it can upload downloading files and traversal directory just fine

1081015
codeigniter	cakephp
you should also look into frameworks like cakephp and codeigniter that do some things like this for you automatically

1081019
model-view-controller	front-controller
first of all a front-controller is typically only 1 part of a larger framework known as a asp.net-mvc model-view-controller

1081019
codeigniter	cakephp
lastly if this is your first big use of php and want to implements something like asp.net-mvc you might checkout something like cakephp or codeigniter

1081024
put	get
i output an anchor tag that was the id of the .post and passed it through .post or get or within the .post based on what the user was click .so that .when they navigated to the page again my code would put in the anchor

1081038
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana
definately checkout some other frameworks like cakephp kohana codeigniter if you need more details and code examples

1081045
compare-and-swap	atomicity
spoiler uses atomicity compare-and-swap cas operations if not available in ruby you could emulate them with locks

1081047
implements	abstract
a list is an abstract data structure adt that can be implements various ways

1081048
linked-list	arrays
this makes the insert into a linked-list very expensive .so much .so that it becomes pointless to have a linked-list you can just use an arrays

1081049
version-control	git
i suspect that there are more project out there using subversion than git and mercurial but the trend seems to be going towards distribute version-control systemd

1081089
codeigniter	joomla
example include joomla concrete5 codeigniter and php cake

1081099
gnome	kde
also it sure would be different under kde gnome fluxbox whatever

1081118
any	set
do not set this in your .bashrc or any other profile- or system-wide setting as it has the potential to cause some nasty problems

1081125
base-class	inherited
for instances all the different types of model could inherited a common base-class or implements a common interface the latter might be the better of the two solutions - but it s difficult to say if you should prefer inheriteded or composition in this case

1081130
.when	ready
.when i m ready

1081139
return-type	arguments
that s not real c++ â i haven t worked with streaming and overloading in a while .so i don t remember the return-type or the exact order of arguments

1081150
constructor	object
also no auto_id in the constructor .when creating the object it should be left as

1081164
profiling	trace
during development i use particletree s php profiling to log errors and other relevant data to a console with the trace messages and line

1081207
shell	bash
finally some cmd won t work on either platform because they are built-in with the shell either windows cmd or bash sh etc such as dir or echo and some of those

1081211
contains	any
in is a lot more efficient and if your item_list doesn t contains any text part.

1081218
carbon	cocoa
is there something built into cocoa carbon that s easier than the options above

1081237
abstract-class	subclassing	abstract-class	base-class	subclassing	base-class
i would add a pure abstract clone methods to class person which definitely looks like it should be an abstract-class existing mainly for the sake of being subclassinging -- if you need a concrete none of the above kind of person it s best done via a separate concrete subclassing otherkindofperson rather than as the base-class itself

1081237
subclassing	base-class
the changes are needed to avoid the slicing effect of using the base-class s copy ctor on a subclassing that has extra attributes as well as preserve any virtual-method s resolution

1081247
restart	reload
only in the development server we activate tomcat reload which takes care of restart the application .when something changes

1081247
restart	reload
you should assign some extra permanent memory to these tomcats and have a way to restart the server as the reload may crash tomcat from time to time

1081284
decimal	hex
generally you will get better search results if you printing out the error numbers in hex instead of signed decimal form

1081300
nyromodal	jqmodal	modal-dialog	jqmodal	modal-dialog	nyromodal
i ve been trying to create my own firefox toolbar with cmd that will open and close a modal-dialog using either jqmodal or nyromodal

1081301
decimal	hex
you can find like unix grep in the include directory of the platform sdk for either the hex value of the entire error-code or the decimal value of just the code section--that is the lower 16-bit

1081303
windows-xp	windows	windows-vista	windows	windows-vista	windows-xp
pretty much any windows-vista or windows 7 user will have it and i am not sure but it might have been include with windows-xp service pack 2 or 3

1081305
versioning	upgrade
they suggest that i upgrade crystal-reports to versioning r2

1081314
mta	sta
.when your service starts have it startup a thread of the appropriate types i can t say since i ve deliberately forgotten all that sta mta stuff

1081317
vb.net	vb6
similar to vb.net having a bad rap due to vb6 history

1081320
margins	padding
i think is equals to one line-height and padding margins between tags should be adjusted to be equals to one or whole multiples of the line height to preserve the themes

1081350
lookup	any
is this .so you have fast lookup to see if any given numbers is a primes

1081357
any	set
currently it is set up to filtering out the properties changes but it can remove any change that matches a series of regular expression

1081380
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to layout an html table it s tabular data and it is rendering differently in firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 2.0.172 edit and ie7 - which rendering the table like google-chrome does

1081385
plugins	add-on
i use netbeans with the foxbeans plugins for add-on development there you just press the run button and firefox starts up with the add-on install into a test .profile

1081402
interface-builder	iboutlet
create a grouping of uitextfield in interface-builder that correspond with the properties on the model class and link them up to corresponding iboutlet on a custom form controllers

1081403
postgresql	mysql
i sort a lot of data and if sqlite cannot sort naturally i suppose the solution is to head back to postgresql or mysql

1081420
recording	playing
my mechanism for this has been to startup two different audio queue one for recording and one for playing

1081435
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
see the sieve-of-eratosthenes see eliben s implementation above or even the sieve of atkin if you re feeling particularly brave and or crazy

1081445
protected	public
normally i add a java .doc to each public methods and to some private protected methodss

1081445
base-class	inherited
should i inherited copy the documentation from the base-class

protected	public
every methods - private protected public - should be documented describing what it does

1081448
base-class	inherited
forget about inheriting documentation from a base-class - you can include a link to it if you like but as long as the information is there that it overrides an inherited methods then the other person is free to look it up for themselves

since no even indexes are primes you could subclassing or wrap bitset to give the trivial answer for all even indexes and half double value as appropriate before passing to from bitset and thus store the whole field in 55mib

1081519
python	ruby	python	lua	python	java
languages like f# java ruby python lua etc

1081528
python	ruby
on reason languages like ruby python and others are on another level of coding

1081530
put	get
while each very useful and usable don t let you get anywhere as close to the machine as c++ and c allow simply put all of those languages impose on you a higher level of abstraction.

1081542
instances	private
your prop variablesiables is al.so defined as a public or visible member by using this.prop doing .so forces you to store the reference of this from the outer function that is actually a reference to the object instances as a private member of the function using variables to get access the instances of the created object and read the public prop member

this assumes that your media_root media directory contains the admin media folder which is what i understood from your question

1081743
http	ssl
transmitting in ssl http provides encryption over the wire

1081766
constructor	object
django s httpresponse object accepts an iterator in its constructor

1081768

that s all you need for many-to-many in oop terms since you mentioned that you don t need to traversal from a machine to its parent stage

1081777
daemons	systemd
in nix like systemd a daemons will normally create a pid file at somewhere to indicate its existence

it uses rhino-mocks again but nunit instead of mstest

1081808
udp	tcp	network-protocols	tcp
an understanding of the network-protocols difference between tcp udp and capacity is important to the architecture and the performance of the systemd performance in this scenario being hugely significant

1081812
internet-explorer	firefox
i only get this error on internet-explorer i tested on 7 and not in firefox

1081823

ifstream	fstream
my project links against a static libs which #includes string iostream fstream and cassert then a call is made to functionality defined in the static libs which in turn call std ifstream open this time directly

1081847
revision	svn	revision	updates
my problem is that whenever i updates a folder via tortoisesvn i get the files that were edited and now different from revision 1 to revision 2 svn adds a to places that were affected

1081855
command-line	cmd
the book talks about the command-line cmd but the workflow for tortoisesvn is similar

1081879
temporary	copy
in this function-call you are passing a temporary copy of the playingcard and taking its address

1081897
temporary	copy
.so what the compiler does is construct a temporary copy of your class instances on stack

1081903
virtualenv	buildout
instead i use virtualenv or buildout to let every application have their own python path where it s dependencies live

1081911
groovy	java
1 the only difference between using jersey from java or from groovy is that java uses and groovy uses around multiple parameters for an annotations

1081932
data-access	ado.net
ado.net is the base data-access technology in .net - it gives you access to a wide variety of data stores relational and non-relational

1081937
entity-framework	ado.net	stored-procedures	ado.net
i d recommend creating stored-procedures for those cases which you can call with plain ado.net or you can you can add them to your model in entity-framework and call them through there

1081956
hprof	jvm
the built-in implementation using this in the jvm is hprof

1081974

1082049
spring-mvc	gwt
it s plenty of support out there if i need but i think i will struggle to maintain spring-mvc and gwt in the same project i read that it s not .so easy but there are a couple of patterns to follow

1082068
operators	keyword
most modern languages have relatively few keyword and operators

1082068
operators	keyword
the problem is that fewer keyword and operators don t usually mean easier to read and understand code - just look at brainfuck - 4 operators no keyword and pretty useless

1082068
operators	keyword
they all have their own extra keyword and operators but if you re going to learn one basic syntax their s is where to start - if you can code in one you can read the others

1082080
python	ruby
the best balance between being concise powerful and readable are ruby and python

1082083
member-functions	inline
is the following free function implicit inline in c++ similar to how member-functions are implicit inline if defined in the class definition

1082085
ruby-on-rails	django
the companies that know what they re doing and take it seriously will evolve this into some kind of in-house framework or i have often found they ll move onto something without the historical crapness of php like django or ruby-on-rails

1082088
getter	setter
they have their uses but for me small functions like getter setter are not one of them

1082096
required	checked
checked your code for include required of this class

1082097
sql-server	mysql
i ve been struggling to get a java program to connect to ms sql-server and i m starting to wonder if mysql would be a better choice for my learning project

1082100
versioning	upgrade
however it means that each of the applications using that libs must use the same versioning and unless backwards-compatibility is ensured must upgrade at the same time

1082107
inlining	inline
of course the compiler may still inline the function if it thinks that will be efficient but it s not the same as an explicit inlining

1082118
postgresql	mysql
you could try either postgresql or mysql

1082128
cassini	iis
for my webapp the integrated visual-studio server cassini ist much slower than iis

1082135
unique	words
pick a words that isn t too common - it doesn t need to be unique but it needs to be a words that people aren t using on every single webpage in the world

1082142
cassini	iis
.when you re using iis are you running on the same computer that had the slow cassini

1082145
oracle	mysql
i recommend mysql or oracle

1082158
postback	ajax
then you might need to write some javascript at client side to fetch the html and send it to the server over an ajax normals postback and then store it from there

1082160
selected	textbox	click	mouse
.so if i list the choices for the month out on the form as labels boxes with little mouse move events to resemble a web link and they click on it to selected then the only way i know how this may become functional is if i add a textbox to the form and make it not visible that way i can named it and add it to the filepath string and it works

1082182
directory	folder
usually the source code goes into an src directory and the documentation goes into a docs folder

1082183
postgresql	oracle	postgresql	mysql	oracle	mysql
i would recommend using javadb for the first one and then one of the other db - oracle mysql postgresql etc

i am looking for soome good examples with c# for tcp or udp

1082219
udp	tcp
as far as i know there is udp and tcp .

1082219
udp	tcp
if in fact a connection is needed again going back to tcp udp

1082221

the first was to add code to my nhibernate repository class to translation the simple poco types used by the asp.net-mvc controllers simplething to the types of entity that nhibernate wanted realthing

1082273
udp	tcp
it sounds to me like you re not clear on the distinction between tcp and udp

1082273
udp	tcp
perhaps it s feasible to use both tcp and udp for different requirements within your .app tcp for registering order udp for transmitting price updates events

1082273
udp	tcp
i d consider your requirements and familiarise yourself with the limitations and features of tcp and udp

1082290
exception-handling	error-handling
the points of exception-handling is to separate the ideal flow from the error-handling flow

1082293
libcrypto	openssl
just for clarification you can do encryption and decryption using libcrypto which is a part of openssl

1082309
rar	zip	gzip	rar	gzip	zip
algorithmss for text - zip bzip gzip rar 7zip are good enough to compress

1082314
contains	any
it could look for a try block that doesn t contains any if-statement

1082323
contains	any
edit i m using javascript and the query can contains any amount of words

1082362
forms-authentication	session-timeout
you should also make sure that your session-timeout and the forms-authentication cookies timeout are the same

1082362
authentication	login
any action that required authentication which minimally required authentication should get back an httpunauthorizedresult which by default redirects to the forms login page

1082364
postgresql	mysql
for most project you will be fine using either mysql or postgresql

1082364
postgresql	mysql
at a later date you may decide you need to use an object-relational-mapping tool like hibernate but i would not worry about that now either just get familiar with jdbc and either mysql or postgresql

1082376
pecl	pear
the http pecl extension can do it also pear http_client snoopy and many many other libs classes

1082379
background-image	transparency
alternatively you can use a png background-image and use javascript to apply transparency

1082385
any	set
is there any penalty such that you should only set them as nullable .when you really need it

1082388
zend-framework	symfony
i d suggest looking into some php frameworks such as cake which is good for beginners or symfony or zend-framework if you re more skilled

1082394
udp	tcp
you shouldn t even consider udp if you re considering tcp too

1082394
udp	tcp
if you re considering tcp means you are thinking in terms of a streaming exactly once inorder messages and using udp will put the burden of fragmentation retry and acknowledgment duplicates detection and order in your .app

1082394
udp	tcp
will be much harder to change your codebase from tcp to udp and vice versa if you made the wrong choice using raw .net socket components

1082400
innodb	myisam
in general for me the most important points is that innodb offers per row locking while myisam does look per table

1082424
fadeout	fadein
also you may wish to consider using the fadein fadeout functions as these are designed to properly apply opacities over a range

1082443
mstest	nunit
i ve only used the basic features of mstest .so far and they have satisfied my needs and i don t really know anything about nunit

1082443
mstest	nunit
could someone list out some of the disadvantages and advantages of using mstest and nunit compared to each other

1082448

if your concern is about editing the text before it is added to the document then you should be using a documentfilter

1082452
mstest	nunit
here is a nice blog which lists out some difference between mstest and nunit

1082462
double	int
the int double conversion is not even related as it is not a class cast but a conversion telling the compiler to store whatever is in x in y which happens to be a double

1082469
double	int
the int double is unrelated

1082469
double	int
that is a conversion not a cast - there is no relationship between int and double

1082472
jruby	mri
the following code will run forever in mri and jruby

1082472
jruby	mri
it s very important for people reading this thread to realize the whole issue is exclusive to jruby â in mri the built-in hash is sufficient

1082476
subclassing	superclass
for the first question you cannot cast a superclass to a subclassing because a subclassing adds members that the superclass doesn t have

1082479
selected	cell
the makefullrowselection methods only selected all cell in a row not the row itself

1082479
selected	cell
of course note that you should specify the selected properties for each cell in the row individually since the row.isselected does not imply or set that

1082502
contains	any
also the claimsresponse returned doesn t actually contains any of the data i requested

1082528
boolean	int
but it should be possible for simple types like int or boolean

1082530
required	checked
there is one situation where iframes are almost required .when the contents of the iframe is in a different domain and you have to perform authentication or checked cookies that are bound to that domain

1082532
exception-handling	try-catch
the function may not internally use try-catch which excludes using enum.parse which throw an exception-handling .when given an invalid arguments

1082554

1082562
sdl	x11
i m using the default sdl x11 drivers

1082562
sdl	x11
googling suggests that it s a known issue with sdl that x11 provides no vsync facility even with a display created with fullscreen|doublebuf|hwsurface flags and i should use the dga drivers instead

1082564
javascript	dom
in ie it appears that document.title is-empty but javascript alert document.body.clientwidth gives a result equals to the client area of the browser .so it looks like there s a dom there as well

1082627
constructor	object
i have a webpage object in another project which sets the enumerator in its constructor

1082634
fwrite	fclose	fwrite	fopen	fclose	fopen

instead of having the preprocesser create a named you could possibly let the macros user give you a named

1082757
ftp	ssh
ftp user creation in plesk via ssh

1082771
ready	live	.when	ready
each spring controllers has the ability to call an init methods you could have each controllers add it s named and url to the controllers url map in the init methodss .so it would be ready to use .when the controllerss go live

1082775
versioning	upgrade
it isn t compulsory to install the full versioning of visual-studio 2008 to upgrade to service pack 1

1082776

i d suggest drawing the discrete elements of the game board pieces counters board squares etc. as individual uiview or calayer then animation those layer or views around

1082808
python	ruby
ruby and python jruby and jython

1082820
javadoc	phpdoc
i find the single most useful feature in netbeans for php work is that it understands phpdoc in the same way that it understands javadoc and uses it for type-hinting

1082828
navigation	styling
there is an elegant css methods of styling the currently active navigation state without any javascript or server side support

1082841
selected	checkbox
.when the user submit your controllers will be able to interrogate the view for a list of the selected checkbox and their ids and then it s a case of going through the model and creating the necessary rows in the database

1082863
perl	php
we compiled perl + php for it after changing s fork vfork g it worked pretty good.

1082868
order	add	order	join
if you want only order with a status of 3 you will need to join with the status table and add that criterion to the where-clause

1082869

if this is for test purposes you should look at mocking frameworks like jmock and easymock

1082881
revision	svn
by running svn mergeinfo for each column i got back the list of trunk revision that had been merged in to that versioning

1082881
contains	any

buffering	streaming
second since you re using a char arrays instead of a std string to hold the buffering it needs to be null-terminated to display properly if you use the streaming operators

1082941
derived-class	base-class
a member pointers to a base-class member can be applied to a derived-class too

1082988
margins	padding
i believe you want to set the text-indent properties and probably adjust the margins and padding as well

1082990
order	add	value	field
you can change the order of field in the table without breaking the query and you can even add field as long as they allow null value or has a default-value

1082991
configuration	installation
thus the default configuration for each new tomcat sever you create will be a new server instances of the tomcat installation associated with the tomcat runtime selected in the wizard

i m working on a distribute codeigniter systemd bamboo buildingforge and would like to avoid downloading the entire dependency hierarchy to checked if a building is required

1083018
spaces	output
if i am monitor a output file in user spaces that gets frequently updates i can monitor it using something like tail -f output.txt

1083036
protected	public
a nested-class can have private protected and protected internal access-modifiers along with public and internal

1083036
instances	private
you can declare that class as a private nested-class and return an instances of it this is actually how the c# compiler implements iterator

1083046
required	checked
what makes this particularily difficult is that it may required getting info about record-content other than the changed ones in particular checked for the existence of uc conflict-values and child-dependent recording for intermediate step

1083059
arrays	loops
you can loops through the arrays to see if the .app you are looking for is already running

.so if you data object all inherited from the same base orm class this base-class can be given a db object that it send queries to

1083154
sigsegv	sigfpe
i m moving a project to the new android native development kit jni and i d like to catch sigsegv should it occur possibly also sigill sigabrt sigfpe inorder to present a nice crash report dialog instead of or before what currently happens the immediate unceremonious death of the process and possibly some attempt by the os to restart it

1083168
python	perl
i ve also considered using the internals of a popular scripting-language like perl or python but that also seems like a lot of overhead just for directory functions

1083178
keyboard	mouse
however i notice that once the frame is not in focus as it is .when its iconized the mouse and keyboard tr.apping that normally works .when the frame .app is in focus no longer works

1083178
keyboard	mouse
i am aware that i could write a c++ program to create a message-queue hook and trap all mouse and keyboard events at the os level but id rather not roll up my sleeves that far

1083180
postgresql	mysql
i m pretty sure i ll be using sqlite for this project but does anyone think postgresql or mysql could perform better with a pretty big join like this

visual-studio	sharpdevelop
i ve tried the more .sort of orthodox approach of using visual-studio 2008 express editions and whatnot but although it apparently plays well with visual-web-developer unfortunately the sqlite-net package fails to work with visual c# .so sharpdevelop is pretty much my only hope now

1083194
height	frame
for example i ve got a function that shrinks a 4 column textframe s height until the text overflows the frame

1083194
indesign-server	indesign
in indesign desktop this works fine with some modifications to make it use the currently selected object but in indesign-server this seems to overshoot during the shrinking phase and then only expand once

1083196
32-bit	64bit
i am beginning to ports a program which is written in c and have several pieces of code written in assembly with instructions for a 32-bit machine - like ljmp - to a 64bit machine

1083196
32-bit	64bit
if not where can i find a document that lists all the instructions for a 32-bit and a 64bit machine

1083196
linux	unix
it is written in a linux box with unix in mind

1083198
callback	methods
if the data is valid and expected use the clientscriptmanager.registerforeventvalidation methods inorder to register the postback or callback data for validation

1083202
control-characters	linefeed
i would need to get a regular expression which matches all unicode control-characters except for carriage return 0x0d linefeed 0x0a and tabulator 0x09

1083205
populate	row
for instances if you re filling a grid yourself - pull the data run through it for each row populate the grid then throw out the data - sqldatareader is much better than dataset

1083207
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
this should work with safari firefox and opera

1083211
keyboard	mouse
do you really need mouse and keyboard events or would it be sufficient to just know if the user has been idle

1083217
mouseover	mouseout
you could chaining the mouseout to the mouseover

1083219
asp.net-mvc	wcf
how can i call a wcf service from jquery i am using asp.net-mvc

1083220
python	perl
i ve also considered using the internals of a popular scripting-language like perl or python but that also seems like a lot of overhead just for directory functions

1083253
early-binding	late-binding
references and pointers use late-binding wherever possible while object use early-binding

1083271
ruby-on-rails	django
i have toes in both the ruby-on-rails and the django camps

1083286
malloc	free
i ll bet 0.02 that it s crash somewhere inside malloc or free in which case the problem is plain old heap-corruption and there are many heap-checker tools available to help you catch it

1083291
any	set	declarative	imperative
sql being declarative and set based any workaround you may find that tries to force sql to do imperative row oriented operations is unreliable and may break

1083293
any	set
however if you are summing searching or any other kind of operation and then kicking off an event once done the entire selection set then you would certainly not use a cursor

1083304
double	int
it can be stored freely int double etc

1083307
json	xml
json or plain xml

1083313
pyscripter	komodo
using many ides editor you can get autocomplete based on the django codebase netbeans pyscripter komodo

1083313
solaris	linux	solaris	unix	linux	unix
you can then hosts on either windows or unix linux solaris mac

1083319
decimal-point	zero
the first is to printf the numbers to a big buffering with a .50f format string stripes off the trailing zero then count the characters after the decimal-point

1083319
multiplying	subtract
the second is to subtract the int portion then iteratively multiplying by 10 and again subtract the int portion until you get zero

1083319
decimal-point	digits
if you know the sort of numbers you ll get they ll all be 0 to 4 digits after the decimal-point you can use standards floating-point tricks to do it properly

1083324
bots	api
they make the examples progressively more interesting -- they introduce the callback-oriented api via a chat bots program

1083325
value	field
i want to have a citystate field in lucene index which will store various city state value like

1083335
sigsegv	sigfpe
you can try to catch them in c see sigaction 2 although you can do very little after a sigsegv or sigfpe or sigill handler as the ongoing behavior of a process is officially undefined

1083336
sql-server	oracle
i deal with multiple database platform sql-server oracle informix and want to keep the task scheduling as generics as possible

1083346
decimal-point	digits	decimal-point	zero	digits	zero
if case a you can avoid converting the numbers from the string representation the problem becomes much easier you only need to count the digits after the decimal-point and subtract the numbers of trailing zero

1083392
compact-framework	.net
json.net supports the .net 3.5 compact-framework

1083401
delphi	c++
languages c++ java delphi and

1083408
decimal-point	digits
a python float has about 15 significant digits .so with seconds being up to 86400 5 digits to the left of the decimal-point and microseconds needing 6 digits you could well include the days up to several years worth without loss of precision

1083414
firefox	safari
also i m using both safari and firefox to debugging

1083420
xsd	xml
i recommended to use wcf as they won t need custom xml formats and won t have to play with xsd either just defined a datacontract in code

1083439
communication	messages
i am trying to implements a very basic reliable messages state handling systemd to provide improved reliability in my silverlight to wcf server communication

1083440
contains	any
this list does not contains any of the order-only

1083460
nsmutablearray	nsarray
this is very bad because imageset was declare to be of types and the object you created has types nsarray and nsarray is not a subtyping of nsmutablearray

1083460
nsmutablearray	nsarray
.so the error occurs because the object is actually an nsarray object not nsmutablearray or subclassing thereof and therefore does not support a replaceobjectatindex withobject messages

1083465
stderr	stdout
then you can use tricks to have that .com be a proxy for the stdin stdout stderr and launchd the same-named .exe file

1083479
double-quotes	single-quotes
if you want to fix up your code you need to should use single-quotes around the arguments that you don t want the shell messing with - not double-quotes

1083479
double-quotes	single-quotes
the double-quotes simply surround the four characters that you replace a single quote with assuming the string as a whole is embedded in single-quotes

1083495
assign	add
the implicit function is the first-class-functions which is assign to first-class value matcher and _.endswith is closed over query similar to the way 3 closes up a in add 3

1083499
linked-list	tree
another option if you can change the model would be to change from a linked-list tree to the nested-set-model

1083508
double	int
the goal would be to allow one to store int int float or double value in the data types

1083517
defined	declare
to declare member variables of a class you should add them to the interface defined in the .h file

1083522
any	set
the benefit of wcf in a design like this is that all the pluming is abstracted away that is any binding channel and set of endpoint can be used and the code on the client and code on the server don t have to change

1083525
any	set
i don t think there are any indexes set on the logtable code columns

1083542
installation	building
there is no installation you just can drag it to your applications folder a lot like the nightly webkit building

1083567
versioning	upgrade
if you have an earlier versioning either upgrade or remove in the snippet above

1083580
selected	button
they also had created an itemhandler class that extended from the actionlistener class that conducted a linear search on the entire arrays of radio button inorder to determine the one that was selected and changes the state of the program accordingly

1083591
post-increment	pre-increment
i think to optimize a bit on leiz s answer i would use pre-increment instead of post-increment on line 3 to read

1083610
vba	vb6
in that case you have few options because event handler cannot be shared in vba vb6

1083640
constructor	object
now the table object has a constructor on it like this

1083640
constructor	object
if i pass them into the constructor of tablemanager doesn t that violate taking object just to pass it down to a inner types and not really using them

1083662
contains	elements
this works because the return-value of is an array-like structure that contains the matched elements

1083669
selected	listbox
you could try to selected all items in the listbox .when the user presses submit

1083732
webrequest	webclient
or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest

1083736
sql-server	mysql
make the db backend migration much easier from mysql to sql-server or others

1083740
order	join
the optimizer comes up with a plan which include a join order

1083740
order	join
it selecteded out the columns mentioned in the join conditional or the selected list or the order by list

1083740
order	join
then it join in the final table and applies the order by

1083748
constructor	object	value	field
in the constructor it sets the selected menu item then in the main methods it accesses the colorvalues field of the object and sets the value of the background

1083749
google-chrome	firefox
you could use the file usercontent.css lying within the directory named google-chrome in your mozilla firefox profiling directory

1083755
google-chrome	safari
in this url i have rounded divs that appear to be rounded in ff3 but on safari and google-chrome the rounded corners are not there

1083767
jquery	dojo
if you can get your server code to conform to the bayeux specifications then you can use any of the existing comet javascript implementation current available in dojo and jquery

1083769
shopping-cart	oscommerce
here is an example application built-in delphi which acts as a front end store manager for oscommerce shopping-cart

1083773
swing	swt
also swing tutorial or checkout swt if you prefer faster and more native looking user-interface

1083794
checkbox	textbox
one of its columns is a checkbox which is supposed to represent a bool properties the rest are comboboxes and textbox

1083821
tokenize	parsing
you can use regular expression to tokenize the input but you need a state machine to parsing it

1083830
double-quotes	single-quotes	double-quotes	spaces
i don t think cmd likes single-quotes .so you must use double-quotes to specify the spaces embedded string arguments

1083836
reverse-dns	spf
the best advice is to ensure you re sending list is clean ip-address has a good reputation reverse-dns spf recording good unsubscribe and bounce handling on the campaigns spam checked on content and get recipients to add you to their address book

1083905
widget	button
the hildon.seekbar widget consists of a scale widget and two button

1083905
widget	button
what signals does the widget send .when the button are click or how could i find out

1083909
device-driver	hardware
another reason for using pointers is that they allow the author of a device-driver to address a specific region of memory which is often useful .when communication with devices because certain areas of memory are mapped to the hardware device

1083932
specifications	w3c
there is no universal answer to this question i was heavily involved in the creation of the w3c specifications

1083939
fireworks	photoshop
i have tried creating the resource in illustrator photoshop and fireworks

1083939
firefox	safari
the problem is the same on firefox as in safari

1083955
difference	count
difference represents count of year s month s week s and day s between two dates

1083964
typedef	struct
you would use a typedef .so you do not need to specify the struct keyword .when declaring variables of that struct

1083976
contains	any
indeed any compression algorithm will necessarily fail to compress any data contains no discernible patterns

1083980
typedef	struct
in c++ this is not .so useful because c++ was designed to make definition of new types easier and more complete than c at least at the beginnings of c++ and the typedef is not even necessary to refer to a previously declare struct or class

1083994
perl	ruby	perl	lua
perl ruby java and lua

1084007
click	mouse
with processor in the ghz responding to each little mouse click tends to go more than fast enough

1084008
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine in ie6 ie7 firefox google-chrome safari and even in my mobile web browser se p1

1084036
shell	bash	shell	tcsh	tcsh	bash
i found unix power tools o reilly to be an awesome resource to learn any of the popular shell bash and tcsh are what i use

1084052
textbox	button
right now i what happens is that .when the button is pressed 0 - current value of text is what is display in the textbox .so if the numbers is positive it will become negative and if it is negative it will become positive

1084059
sql-server	ms-access
instead you should choose a desktop or in-process class engine like sql-server compact edition sqlite or even ms-access

1084069
expression	evaluation
i know the theory behind evaluation of regular expression and have a sufficient understanding of finite state-machines etc

1084071
xsd	xml
i am using the following cmd to generator related xsd file from my input xml file -- response.xml my confusion is 1 why there are two xsd file output response.xsd and response_app1.xsd i think there should be only one of them generator

1084071
xsd	xml
here is my input xml file and output xsd files

1084097
subtraction	addition
should you learn how to do basic arithmetic like subtraction and addition by hand .when now we have calculator and computer that can do this for you

1084119
elementtree	lxml	libxml2	libxslt	libxml2	lxml
i typically uses lxml that exposes an elementtree around libxml2 and libxslt

1084126
png	gif
png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

1084130
gethashcode	tostring	gethashcode	equals	tostring	equals
object has four public methods tostring gethashcode gettype and equals

1084136
zend-framework	drupal	pecl	pear
also keep in mind any third party libs extensions pecl pear zend-framework drupal wordpress or custom written that you re using that may not work on 5.3 yet for any given reason

1084148
display	width	margins	padding
the width is to allow enough room in the display selected box .when not active the margins does what it always does text-indent is used to feign padding between the left boundary of the selected box and the inner-text

1084165
comparator	sortedset
java uses sorted collections to mean a collections such as sortedset where unlike list the order that the iterator traversal the collections is in accordance with a specified comparator or the natural order of the elements

1084173
sortedset	sortedmap
sortedmap and sortedset are sorted collectionss which means that iterator through the collections will happen in a sequences derived from the elements themselves

1084173
order	add
a sorted collections is always implicit order there is always a first elements and it s always the same as long as you don t add another smaller one

1084174
protected	public
protected constructor can be useful .when you are providing it along with some public overloads to provide some more functionality to derived classes

1084205
multiplying	subtract
what you probably want to do is negate the numeric value just multiplying it by -1 or subtract it from 0 as you suggested and reflect that change in the interface you mention a textbox

1084255
subclassing	base-class
and all my subclassing can shared implementation details via the base-class

1084263
user-defined-functions	udf
.so that you don t have to read the entire discussion i had never heard it said that user-defined-functions udf were slow or to be avoided

1084272
compatibility	platform
i don t know about the compatibility of archiving across platform but to refer to a bundle resource you should always use nsbundle to find it

1084275
.net-remoting	asmx
a single interface can be decorated to support .net-remoting wcf and asmx

1084275
.net-remoting	asmx
wrapping the client connection code in a proxy allows developers to switching between .net-remoting wcf and asmx on-the-fly

1084287
digits	base
you might want to do this in a more explicit fashion by modding with 10 to get the last digits subtract and then divide think of a shift in base 10

1084290
division	exponent
it might be more efficient to do repeated integral division than to cast to a float perform an exponent then floor and cast back to an int but the basic idea remains the same

1084301
division	modulo
if you really don t want to do that though you should use modulo which gives the remainder of a division

1084323
filtering	sorting
if all you re looking for is sorting and filtering then just use a dataset and create a dataview referring to the table you ve filled in

1084336
getter	setter
what code should not be unit tested apart from getter and setter

1084338
cout	cin
the easiest is probably to move out of a direct cin cout loops and to use std getline instead

1084341
arrays	map
as others said there is very little good reason to use vanilla arrays if you don t want to use a map use std vector or std list depending on whether you need insert delete data list or not vector

1084350
deployment	install
now after deployment .when i am installing the application in my clients machine is it necessary to first install .net visualstudio2008 and sql-server 2008 before installing application

1084364
selected	listbox	listboxitem	selected
.when i selected a listboxitem i want some other listboxitem in the same listbox to be selecteded automatically

1084364
selected	listbox	listboxitem	selected
my listbox is already bound to a datatable which has a isselected column.i am using the value of this column in a styles setter to make the listboxitem selected.suppose i have 10 rows in the datatable.now if the user selected the second listboxitem i can get the isselected of the correspondong row in the database as 1

1084408
textbox	button
on new windows child i have textbox and button i need to get the value of the textbox and pass to parent windows .when user click on button while closing the child windows i need the updates value insert into parent windows without refreshing parent windows .so i can display my value to .some hidden-field labels of the parent windows how can i do that

1084408
textbox	button
2- child windows has textbox and button .when button click child will do a .post to server to updates database then pass the value of textbox to parent windows without refreshing parent windows and close child windows

1084413
postgresql	oracle
alternatively a way to run the perl as the procedural language within the oracle context analogous to the following in postgresql

1084420
contains	elements
just have the callback from the button that closes the windows extraction the value from the dom elements contains in the dialog and copy it to the target dom elements on the form

1084422
duplicates	sorted
you have actually sorted all the numbers in the process however count of duplicates is not tracked

1084433
buffering	streaming
i presume that this required some kind of streaming buffering arrangement

1084437
digits	base
you have to realize that numbers don t have digits only strings do and how many and which digits they have depends entirely on the base which numbers don t have either

1084437
digits	base
.so in general manipulating base 10 digits required you to convert the numbers to a string first - or do calculations that are the same you would do .when converting it to a string

1084444
search-engine	web-crawler
i have written a few web-crawler and content extractors using usual ruby libs but not a full fledged search-engine

1084452
mac-address	ethernet
he wants to tie a desktop-application to a hardware component value one of which is easily changed the mac-address of the ethernet controllers

1084461
eclipse-plugin	ant
i could be wrong on that one as we weren t using the rim eclipse-plugin just building it all with ant

1084461
debugging	exit
in the end we resorted to using our own function debugging code that manually logged entries exit parameters and run time sending the result to a special server

1084462
triggers	insert	value	field
on tables with autoinc triggers based .when i try to .post the data it says that the field with the autoincrement must have a value whereas if i use a sql query to insert it everything works fine

1084481
http-get	put
the object you put into the data properties is the data that will be added as a query-string in an http-get or added as the messages body for a http-post

1084492
stderr	stdout
the technique uses tricks to have that .com be a proxy for the stdin stdout stderr and launchd the same-named .exe file

1084496
windows-vista	windows-xp
i am trying to create a new windows-vista service through sc utility in cmd run from some reason what worked in windows-xp doesn t work in vista surprised

1084514
keyboard	mouse
i d like to write a program able to use other programs by taking control of the mouse keyboard and being able to see what s on the screens

1084514
click	mouse
use the mouse move click and release it s simple isn t it

1084532
show	next
if something show up in p2p networks just talk to the user to whom you issued the serial and ban it in the next release

1084543
webforms	asp.net	asp.net-mvc	webforms
the best would be to have an asp.net-mvc add-on but i can live with asp.net webforms

1084544
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome but in firefox .when i try to start dragging it fails

1084551
javascript	dom
with jquery the basic concept is that you bind javascript methods to dom elements in a separate .js file rather than using html on_this or on_that attributes

1084554
python	c++	python	java	geos	ogr
then hydrate the original geometry that you used in your query into a geometry object of gis geometry libs like geos c++ based although it also has binding for different languages like python shapely ogr or the java topology suite jts

1084557
order	add
note that depending on how you handle the x-axis you might also need to add 0 entries for days without any order

1084558
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it is an webforms .app not asp.net-mvc however

1084566
arguments	default
but my problem is with the default arguments as you see here

1084566
arguments	default
as you see the no_def_args is not in the default .so it s a problem to try to match the arguments with their default-argumentss

1084567
buffering	streaming
you create a secondary directsound buffering and then use it to streaming over to your primary buffering and play

1084572
scala	java
quick note examples from the tutorial scala for java refugees part 5 traits and types

1084591
spring	jsf
i see there are lots of different stuff going on such as jsp jsf spring etc

1084594
any	set
win32 api has a set of interlockedxxx functions to atomically and synchronous manipulate simple variabless however there doesn t seem to be any interlockedread function to simply retrive the value of the variables

1084642
e-commerce	product
all i can seem to find through google are product that will do this for me or full e-commerce solutions

1084654
synchronous	.when
in case you play it synchronous blocking the calling thread you know .when the sound ends playing â your code gain control then

1084656
scheme	lisp
have a look at peter norvig s tutorial on good lisp programming styles though you would have found the answer to your particular question in any scheme lisp book

1084659
any	set
i want to reset the checked properties of all taction object of a ribbon to false .when click on any ribbon button and then only set it true on the pressed button

1084662
navigation	styling
that way user agents can expose the structured content with useful styling and navigation controls to users who can t see your suggested bold styling users of search engines totally blind users using screen-readers poorly sighted users using their own colors and fonts geeky users using text browsers users of voice-controlled speaking browsers like opera for windows

1084674
webforms	asp.net
it is building using asp.net webforms

1084698
32-bit	16-bit
the two numbers would expand to 32-bit get subtract then truncated back to 16-bit which is how ms intended it to be

1084723
lotus	ibm
there s an eclipse based ibm product called lotus expeditor that does exactly this

1084729
subtraction	addition	decrement	increment
the increment ++ and decrement -- operators as well as the addition assignment + and subtraction assignment - operators are overloaded for a variety of numeric typess and they perform the extra step of converting the result back to the operands s types .when returning the result

1084744
tabpanel	tabs
i have a rich tabpanel with several tabs in it

1084747
administration	account
worst case the administration will have to change settings on a handful of account on the same computer instead of one

1084771
32-bit	16-bit
the two numbers would expand to 32-bit get added then truncated back to 16-bit which is how ms intended it to be

1084773
keyboard	mouse
it lets you fake keyboard and mouse input nicely at a systemd level ie not just posting events to a single application

1084794
contains	any
not sure if this is the usual sort of question that gets asked around here or if i ll get any answers to this one but i m looking for a pseudo-code approach to generator db linking recording from a folder structure contains image files

1084794
placeholder	required
default is just that - a placeholder and no links are required for it.

1084812
mathml	latex
i m writing a bison flex program to convert latex into mathml

ubuntu	linux
updates i m seeing the same problem on my linux machine ubuntu 8.10 running git 1.6.3.2 and svn 1.5.1

1084825
required	checked
checked if you have support for sqlite it doesn t required a server .so it might work for you

1084842
any	set
but this is for python and i have feeling that this might not necessary work for jython windows and i don t have any dev stuff set up in my windows viewmodel to test at this moment

1084846
.net	wcf
shoud i use wcf and if .so what are my options with a .net 2.0 client our product cannot required 3.5 on the desktop

in other words can i use a .net 2.0 tcpclient class to talk to a 3.5 wcf tcp server

1084851
configuration	environment
this error is triggers by the configuration.cache_classes true line in configuration environment production.rb

1084861
firefox	safari
it does work in firefox and safari it does not work in ie

1084873
parser-generator	antlr
should i use a parser-generator like antlr or yacc or use straight regular expression

1084873
expression	evaluation
can anyone provide me with tips concerning the parsing of these arbitrary expression and eventually evaluation the parsing expression

1084882
expression	evaluation
you could use the idea of converting an expression to postfix and evaluation postfix expression or directly building an expression tree out of the infix expression and using that to generator the truth table to solve this problem

1084895
value	field
now create if you don t alread have one a unique serial-number field counter say and make sure that you enter a value in each recording

1084895
value	field
finally find all click in the application field and use replace field contents... with a calculation to force the auto-enter calc for app_prog to come up with a value

1084905
dictionary	hashmap
the key change is the line in python this means to make merged a new dictionary a dictionary is a generics mapping would be typically called a hashmap in other languages which is the sum or merge of default_version and years_dictionary but .when a key is present in both of those the value from years_dictionary takes precedence -- which meets the key conditional for a year that s present is a year with a change in files in both

authentication	login
the asp.net web application uses a custom implementation of the asp.net membership-provider model with passwd stored in hash form to authentication users who login to the web application

1084911
membership	guid
based on other questions and answers i have seen i am considering a sort of login session approach where a login session will be created in the custom membership database .when the user initially logs in to the web application with the login session identified by a guid and automatically expired after a period of inactivity

1084913
.net	wcf
the .net 2.0 class libs are much more complete than the .net 3.0 3.5 ones no wpf no wf limited wcf

1084935
python	c++
qt would be the toolkit for me to use but i am undecided if i should use python looks to me like the easier to learn with a few general ideas about programming or c++ the thing to use with qt

1084946
data-structures	dictionary
this does modify the initial data-structures rather than creating new ones as truppo s answer does and is also an expression returning the overall dictionary rather than being a statement like evan s answer or returning none like seth s

1084950
integration	payment
whilst not the most glamorous of elements many payment service providers use iframes for the verified by visa mastercard secure code integration

1084953
callback	methods
if the data is valid and expected use the clientscriptmanager.registerforeventvalidation methods inorder to register the postback or callback data for validation

1084958
python	c++
being an expert in both c++ and python my mantra has long been python where i can c++ where i must python is faster in term of programmer productivity and development cycle and easier c++ can give that extra bit of power .when i have to get close to the hardware or be extremely careful about every byte or machine cycle i spend

1084968
punctuation	words
if i give you a sequences the dog rover ate his food. the first thing you do is break it up into words and punctuation

1084970
value	field
the xslt transformation would have to parsing the text string value into the desired xml field

1084970
python	java
another possibility is to write a small scripting in python or java that reads the xml content for you then performs the conversion

1084975
scheme	lisp
writing a scheme lisp processor is a project of this types

1084975
mathml	xhtml	mathml	latex
edit i really like the idea of a latex to xhtml mathml translator and i passed the idea to my instructor in which he wrote back

1084975
mathml	xhtml
i m wondering if converting this to xhtml or mathml is really a change in levels and complexity

1085018
environment	building
i have the make-3.80 sources and a complete working cygwin building environment

1085041
lisp	apl
lisp apl etc if this is your first time creating a compiler interpreter then it will al.so be a better choice to go with an already existent language .so you can see what design elements are needed to create a successful language.

1085087
contains	set
most many-to-manys contains other information in the relationship and are better mapped as a set of one-to-manys

1085088
protected	public
i also didn t know if the points was to make the .profile methods behave like ruby s public protected private keyword

1085111
keyboard	mouse
if you are comfortable with pascal a really powerful keyboard mouse screen-reading program is scar named scar it can do ocr bitmap finding color finding etc

1085114
32-bit	64bit
basically all 32-bit value have the required alignment and on a 64bit platform 64bit value also have the required alignment

1085114
alignment	layout
note though there are attributes to explicit alter the layout of classes in memory which may cause you to lose this alignment

1085114
32-bit	64bit
if you are dealing with a 64bit value on 32-bit hardware you may need to use the interlocked.read operation to guarantee the whole 64bit value is read in a single atomicity operation otherwise it may be performed as 2 separate 32-bit reads which can be from either side of a memory updates

1085120
python	perl	python	java
the perl syntax is pretty much that same syntax used in java python and a numbers of other languages

1085121
selected	button
i m trying to make functionality .when user selected one row then click on edit button and then he will be able to edit that particular object

1085125
getter	setter
each member in the model must be a properties with a getter and a setter

1085132
.net	wcf
i am using wcf in .net 3.5 to implements a peer to peer networking application

1085132
callback	methods
for instances i could call one of the methods in my contract registernodes and each nodes in the network could use a callback to call synchronizememberlist

1085153
double	int
boxing is the term for turning a value-type int double float guid etc. into a reference-type system.object system.string etc.

1085154
repository	entity
in a repository-pattern the repository is the collections and you interact with it with collections semantics to get a particular instances of the entity the repository is supposed to be holding

1085174
selected	button
this way the asp.net event will come directly from the selected button and you will therefore not be caught be an invalid postback security checked

1085186
selected	cell
the user selected either the start cell or the end cell turning it blue and then uses a uidatepicker to change the value for each

1085186
selected	cell
i ve got everything working as expected except that the user can click outside the table which causes none of the table cell to be selected

1085186
selected	cell
ideally i would be able to restrict the user to always have one of the table cell selected

1085186
selected	cell
barring that i would settle for being able to detection that no cell have been selected .so i can intercept the uidatepicker before it edits anything

1085197
selected	cell
you may want to put the picker in a separate view that you push onto the screens .when the user selected one of the cell

1085201
jedit	emacs
you can use a modular systemd like jedit or emacs

1085214
export	csv
i am building a c# application that export a csv file to be used with the visio org charts wizard

1085238
copy-constructor	constructor
i also don t understand the use of a copy-constructor assignment constructor here

1085242
windows-xp	windows
see how to set the path in windows 2000 windows-xp for changing environment variables on windows

1085247
python	ruby	python	java	macros	let
for java there would be beanshell or perhaps favor a language like ruby or python which have that inherently and develop look for macros which let you selected a chunks of text and pass it to the scripting runner to quickly checked syntax .when you are not sure

1085263
mathml	latex
it wouldn t have to do everything but if i could just cut-and-paste mathematical formula written in valid latex code into a windows and have the scripting parsing it and convert it into valid mathml that d be awesome

1085270
spring	grails
specifically if i could write a groovy scripting which has access to the spring beans and domain classes defined within the grails application it seems like i could save myself a lot of time

1085272
decrement	increment
i ve modified my stack implementation .so that constructor increment it and destructor decrement it just to verify that the numbers of constructions and destructions are equals

1085282
linux	unix
in unix linux however the shell is the ide

1085282
shell	bash
your shell bash etc. is for

1085282
cvs	git
you can t beat the shell integration you get with svn cvs git etc

1085282
emacs	vim
vim emacs but never under-estimate

1085288
chown	chmod
i want to give people the option to use chown and chmod

1085290
multiplication	multiplying
but convolving is the same as multiplying in the fourier domain .so repeated application of the filtering is like repeated multiplication in the fourier domain and here you can see that things will either blow up or go to zero

1085311
contains	elements
where resultsdatagridview has been created with the ide and querytextbox is a textbox elements contains the sql statement

1085321
buildpath	libs
buildpath add libs junit unable to add junit3 or junit4 components

1085340
chown	chmod
full chown chmod in a web .app is equivalent to just pasting your root passwd on the page

1085340
perl	php
i would take the user request and queue them then have a separate process could be shell php perl anything running as root by crontab checked this queue checked to see if the request fit the allowed parameters and make the changes

1085355
click	mouse
click using mouse

1085356
ironpython	ironruby
i d be astonished if that was the case in an overall systemd that supports dynamic-languages as .net now does such as ironruby and ironpython -- maybe if c# won t let you go around accessibility limitations via introspection the dynamic-languages could serve

1085386
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1085388
sql-server	mysql
i am not familiar with mysql but here is the way i would do it in tsql sql-server maybe try to find an equivalent way of doing it in mysql

1085389
oracle	mysql
what you really want is start with and connect by syntax but this is only supported in oracle not mysql

1085404
ebnf	bnf
i know bnf ebnf i ve written grammar to parsing simple context-free languages in one of my college courses

1085445
contact	submit
tdo mini forms can be used to create outside-the-box uses for wordpress from contact managers ad managers collaborate image sites submit links etc

1085449
show	next
i would expect them to show up as missing or deleted on my next commit but that doesn t seem to be the case

1085477
chown	chmod
perhaps you should look at the php cmd chmod chown chgrp and fileperms

1085490
llvm	gcc
i m particularly interested in c++ compiling optimization gcc and llvm

1085498
hotmail	gmail
hi can .somebody tell me how to import all of my contact from gmail yahoo hotmail and .so on

1085510
authentication	login
first screens of my application provides login screens that authentication user

hide	show
as we all know there is no way to hide or show some tab pages on the tab control

1085584
64bit	x86
c# - how to get program files x86 on windows-vista 64bit

1085609
accessor	ivar
if it isn t the above it is probably either specified an observers on an ivar or are using object serialization and don t actually have an accessor methods for it and thus throw an exception-handling

1085624
callback	methods
you may use the callback of the hide methods

1085624
callback	methods
above is only one methods to make use of that basically the callback will only fires .when the animation finished ie totally hidden

1085638
ienumerator	ienumerable
i was going through ienumerable and ienumerator but could not get one points clearly..if we have foreach then why do we need this two interfaces

1085641
put	get
and how to get console out put from this class

1085669
value	field
as a hackery idea you could append a field to the table data-type and value is irrelevant that is updates by no operation but by triggers

1085674
value	field
returns value of the specified field of the object

1085674
callback	methods
but .when we create pointers to this methods callback and invoke it returns an undefined value because this inside methods s scoping now is global object

1085733
.net	wcf
you might want to look at using the wcf service moniker which lets you invoke a wcf service from vba without installing anything on the excel client machine other than the .net

1085736
.net	wcf
you might want to look at using the wcf service moniker which lets you invoke a wcf service from vba without installing anything on the excel client machine other than the .net

1085788
constructor	object
first you ll need to allocate a networkstream object by using the constructor that takes the socket as the parameter

1085788
constructor	object	networkstream	sslstream
then i created an sslstream object by using the constructor that takes networkstream bool remotecertificatevalidationcallback

1085791
python	java
working in the java environment but also a python user i wondered if sphinx would run on jython 2.5

1085803
firefox	safari
this works fine in safari and mozilla firefox

1085809
selected	button
you can move controls up and down the tree by selected them and pressing the up and down button

1085821
mobile-devices	mobile-phones
for devices aside from a pc dongle or bluetooth built-in to a laptop most mobile-phones support an amazing numbers of bluetooth profiling as do other mobile-devices

1085837
.when	ready
the problem was that i was creating the map .when the dom was ready with jquery

1085838
.when	ready
instances the objectoutputstream only .when you are ready to do .so

1085845
eclipse-plugin	subclipse
if you want to use an eclipse-plugin you could try subclipse

1085853
directory	folder
this technique will only work with inline-code if you wish to compile your code then you would create the site as normals and then add an application folder within the virtual directory of that particular site for example my site is called intranet

1085855
attributes	properties
as for remotevalidation.models.user -- you can pass any other class as long as it uses annotations attributes on its properties

1085857
any	set
you ll probably find that you ll need to set up apache2 as the default webserver and then use the apache2-tomcat connector to pass any tomcat connections to tomcat

1085870
right-align	margins
one thing i ve seen mentioned is that the header text can appear to not right-align .when the sort glyph is stopping it from aligning fully to the cell margins

1085873
malloc	free
however this tends to triggers crash on windows since it s not unlikely to happen that the object is new ed in the plugins dll but later due to a deref call on the shared pointers deleted in the main application - and afaik this malloc free mixup is a no-no on windows

1085895
value	field
you need to set the following properties for the tibctable component to automatically fill out the field with value from the same generator sequences that you use in your triggers

1085896
scrollable	panels
also if i were to building such a control does there exist a convenient built-in control for making like a list of custom-controls that is scrollable - maybe panels

1085898
python	java
currently google-app-engine supports both python java

1085929
any	set
however the google-.app-engine does restrict the set of classes you can use from the normals java se set and you will want to investigate if any of these implementation can be used on the .app engine

1085936
keyboard	mouse
mouse and keyboard actions to windows

1085938
library-project	buildpath
the mxml application references to the as3 library-project flex buildpath

1085973
contains	any
the table i am pulling information from has no uniqiue columns and contains information on rate changes .so for any particular client there can be several rate changes - i only want the most recent rate change for each client

1085991
credentials	account
is there any way i can programmatically pass the credentials another domain account instead of nt authority network service by default to sharepoint .when invoking openweb methods

1086003
search-engine	seo
you re asking more about search-engine optimization seo which has nothing much to do with how you store your content in the server

1086030
value	field
i m trying to get the value of a few checkbox and enter them in a hidden form field is there a way to do that in jquery

1086030
hidden-field	checkbox
i only need to submit the hidden-field data .so i d like the value of the hidden-field change .when the checkbox is ticked

1086030
hidden-field	checkbox
.so if the first checkbox is ticked i d like the value of the hidden-field to become chicken and if both of them are ticked the value should be chicken meat

1086050
account	api
but you need you tube api account

1086078
.when	ready
or do this .when you are ready with the results from my async methods call

1086093
hidden-field	checkbox
if you wanted to include all the checkbox in the document you would change it to but probably the best way to avoid unexpected behavior later on is to give all the checkbox you want to include in the hidden-field a common class and then make your selector something like

1086106
directory	folder
.when you create your own custom virtual folder and set it inside the iis it s highly possible that the user account who run the application-pool of that particular iis virtual directory is currently set to nt authority network service

1086111
authentication	login
i m not sure what authentication you refer to with login but if the server required http auth you need to implements the delegation methods

1086118
checkbox	button
on the other hand if you need some functionality that is not available in the datagridview for example you would like 5 different button at the bottom of the tweets and 3 checkbox on the right then the custom control would do you better because you could building practically everything you wanted

1086133
cvs	git
i m report a series of commit from git to cvs with cvsexportcommit

1086133
cvs	git
failed to cvs add prometeo versioning -- you may need to do it manually at usr local git libexec git-core git-cvsexportcommit line 314

1086144
triggers	insert
we checked if the triggers works for insert then updates the value we insert will be preserve

1086149
internet-explorer	firefox
.so my issue is the following this methods works ok in firefox but in internet-explorer the gif file is loaded but it s not animated just static.

1086153
click	mouse
but i only get the standards tooltip behavior meaning that the messages appears half a second after my click only because the mouse pointers is still over the button

1086157
higher-order-functions	first-class-functions
delegation are simply .net s implementation of first-class-functions and allow the languages using them to provide higher-order-functions

1086158
margins	padding
indeed move your margins padding to the a elements kinda like .so

1086182
32-bit	64bit
therefore they will need 10gb ram which is impossible on a 32-bit process and likely to break total available ram page on 64bit

1086187
constructor	object
you re calling the arrays constructor which creates an arrays not the object constructor ten time

1086187
double	int
the only constructor being called implicit are value-type struct like int and double

1086217
tripledes	rsa
just .so that you know - rsa is asymmetric tripledes and rijndael are symmetric

1086218
32-bit	64bit
the most likely reason is that the calling code is 32-bit and the com server is 64bit and therefore can t be loaded as an in-proc server

1086226
perl	php
another alternative would be to write a simple scripting in php perl or server-language-of-your-choice which takes the required offset as input and returns the chunks of data you need again over http

1086239
authentication	login
session information is linked to a session cookies and cookiess are bound to only one domain .so it s not possible to authentication against more than one domain with one login form

1086249
higher-order-functions	first-class-functions
languages that support this construct also usually heavily take advantage of the concept of passing functions as parameters particularly in regards to working with lists first-class-functions and higher-order-functions

1086250
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

1086253
ienumerator	ienumerable
you don t need to use ienumerator and ienumerable although it generally is a very good idea to do .so

1086259
python	java
based on experience with running these vms on other platform i d say that you ll probably get more raw performance out of java than python

1086259
python	java
don t underestimate python selling points however the python language is much more productive in terms of lines-of-code - the general agreement is that python required a third of the code of an equivalent java program while remaining as or more readable

1086259
python	java
with regards to available libs you ll find that much of the extensive python runtime libs works out of the box as does java s

1086260
interpreted-language	smalltalk
interpreted-language - smalltalk

1086264
ruby-on-rails	camping
i like _why s camping now maintained by the community which has to be the lightest of them all for recent info v1.9 see the camping links on the camping wiki eleanor mchughe s going off the ruby-on-rails or v 1.5 jeremy mcanally s going camping slider or these camping screencast this camping podcast and nathaniel talbott s why camping matters but read the camping mailing list for current versioning info changes and evolution and try the latest blog example

1086288
uisearchbar	uitableview
first make sure to add the uisearchbar to the tableheaderview of the uitableview .so that it gets scrolled with the table s content and isn t fixed to the top of the view

1086290
export	report
.when a report is show there are export to... button and i would like to automate the saving to pdf function

1086307
duplicates	contains
if you cannot be sure that the source data doesn t contains duplicates object references then you can remove them by doing something like the following

1086311
beautifulsoup	lxml
that looks fine and beautifulsoup is useful for this although i personally tend to use lxml

1086313
32-bit	64bit
i m targeting both 32-bit and 64bit environment with my solutions but inorder to create 64bit msi s i need to have have a 64bit machine and the 64bit versioning of wix

1086313
32-bit	64bit
but there are some issues with developing sharepoint solutions on a 64bit platform which more or less forces me to develop on the 32-bit platform

1086313
32-bit	64bit
is there any trick to flag building the 64bit msi package on my 32-bit dev box if it s even possible

1086323
perl	awk
grep sed awk perl python.

1086327
windows-vista	windows-xp
i m using the themes libs to draw some text which works absolutely fine on windows-vista - however on windows-xp the returned hthemes is null

1086339
boolean	int
if the numbers of boolean attributes does not change you could put them into a single int field and mask them as mike chaliy suggests

1086343
boolean	int	value	field
i have seen people doing things like having a 32-bit int field thus allowing them to store their 17 boolean value using bitmasking and leaving some room for additional field

1086354
constructor	private
you can have a private inner class with a package-scope constructor and this is what i usually do

1086359
arrays	loops
i am al.so creating an arrays in loops i ll paste the original code .so that you can understand it in a better way

1086366
for-loop	arrays
just building the arrays in your for-loop

1086373
subtract	time
i m wondering if during the time elapsed between the first call to get_time and the next oracle s internal counter rolled over from its max value and its min value resulting in an overflow .when trying to subtract one from the other

1086383
any	set
i don t have any code at hand but i think it s in onprepareprintdc or .something like that where you set m_maxpage or .so member of the object you get as an arguments

1086393
selected	checkbox
i m not interested in being able to selected the rows at all really i just need the user to be able to selected the checkbox in column 1

1086393
selected	checkbox
will it affect the ability to selected the checkbox in column1

1086402
buffering	streaming
but i did manage to make a hack to resolve this issue if you listen to the netstatus event and wait for an empty buffering event you pause the streaming

1086402
buffering	streaming
ideally now you listen for a buffering full event and resume it- but since the streaming is paused- the buffering doesn t building but of course the video is still being loaded in

1086414
subclassing	superclass
can we assume the order in which they will be triggers as the superclass s constructor was called and added the handler before the subclassing

1086450
delphi	c++
i m not a c++ guru - i m coming from a delphi c# background

1086467
revision	updates
for our project we utilize a triggers on the table that is being updates which saves a recording of the changes to the most interesting value in the table plus the users login named a unique identifier and a time stamp into a shadow table for revision edit logging

1086478
http	ssl
if i configure the four portss http and http to have different value and none of the http value is the value of the ssl ports configure and certified in iis i get the following exception-handling on service call but both service are started in the wcf service hosts

1086478
http	ssl
if i configure the first service to use the ssl ports 443 then only the second service is started the one with the wrong http ports

1086479
selected	checkbox
goober i encountered a similar problem where i needed user to selected rows using checkbox

1086479
populate	row
the first row is always selected by default after the gridview is populate irrespective of the gridview settings

1086479
populate	row
to make sure the first row is not selected everytime the gridview is populate do a clearselection

1086500
getter	setter	initializer	setter	initializer	getter
it s better practice to initializer variables via constructor and getter and setter methods of the class

1086510
any	set
in an access project adp there is a macros set up the call a stored procedure on a sql-server 2005 database which updates a table but does not return any results

1086513
contains	elements	contains	any
a content model must be formed such that during validation of an elements information item sequences the particle contains directly indirectly or implicit therein with which to attempt to validation each item in the sequences in turn can be uniquely determined without examining the content or attributes of that item and without any information about the items in the remainder of the sequences.

1086523
core-audio	openal
i pushed pretty hard on javax.sound.sampled a few years back and came away deeply unimpressed -- it doesn t compare with equivalent frameworks like openal or mac iphone s core-audio both of which i ve used at a similar level of intensity

1086526
perl	php
if not is there a reason why these languages are often used within a framework while perl and php are not

1086526
perl	php
php and perl were popular languages for building web sites well before the idea of using frameworks was

1086526
python	ruby
i m not sure that python or ruby were that common as web languages before they were backed by frameworks

1086526
perl	php
these days even php perl web developement should be backed by a framework of which there are now many

1086527
textbox	button
i then building the dialog box and add an anonymous-function for the ok button this runs my code to test if there is anything in a textbox if there isn t it simply alert the user otherwise it

1086533
selected	textbox
for everything else like a simple textbox or selected box .when writing the value to the page i always run it through html-entities

1086536
administration	integrated
i have elmah up and running in my asp.net-mvc site and i would like to integrated its interface with the administration pages of the site

1086543
uitableview	uiview
looking at the effect on my phone i think i would have a completely transparency but black uiview overlapping my uitableview

1086562
hidden-field	checkbox
give the my-item-named hidden-field an id can be the same as named give the checkbox the same named

1086572
business-logic-layer	data-access-layer
the data-access-layer dal is the layer of a systemd that exists between the business-logic-layer and the persistent storage layer

1086578
boost	stl
stl and boost why

1086589
value	field
you could then extends ar base s create updates methods to checked for the existence of a created_by updatesd_by field on model and set the value to user.current_user

1086614
contains	set
also if the set directly or indirectly contains itself something odd is likely to happen exactly what is implementation and phase of the moon dependent

1086615
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
otherwise i d recommend using the asihttprequest libs which provides a great high-level api to the cfnetwork apis including the ability to use self-signed certificates

1086622
contains	any
checked for the visible properties on any controls contains this control

1086624
contains	set
but usually either equals or hashcode must remain the same while the object is contains in the set

1086632
32-bit	64bit
i am having problem with the contents of a pointers passed as the wparam from a 32-bit c# application is changing along the way to a 64bit c++ process

1086661
firefox	safari
it rendering the intended way in firefox although as expected its not good on safari

1086670
.war	jar
the solution i use is to put only web resources into the .war and to put the .war s class files into a seperate jar inside the ear

1086673
javascript	dom
the problem now is that in onload event of the body tag i call a function in the javascript that initializer the javascript arrays with value from code-behind arrays and the problem is that in .some cases the function is not entered as i traced it by putting an alert in the begining of the function and i found that .when the javascript arrays is not filled the code of the function is not entered as the alert is not showed .so i don t know how to force the dom to enter this function which i call it in the tag here sample of the code

1086687
32-bit	64bit
however this has nothing to do with 32-bit vs 64bit at all

1086690
sftp	ftp
zeus lite has ftp sftp editing

1086695
jquery	.post
is there anyway that i can open a new windows in the browser using jquery and .post to it

1086706
edmx	dbml
one such tool is my add-in huagati dbml edmx tools

1086735
postback	ajax
.so ajax and javascript is not working in this case and we need a way to redirect him after the postback to a page that can checked if is a real user or an attacker and stop him - but if is a real user must return back to his normals action

1086735
authentication	login
in this case we need to keep somewhere all the posted back data to proceed with the login page and resend them back to the first page that request the authentication

1086741
selected	checkbox
an advantage of using labels with the and input with the matching is that .when you click on the labels the checkbox will be selected unselected

1086830
solaris	linux	32-bit	64bit
these tools will provide the details of the os on which it is running like 32-bit or 64bit os exact versioning of linux solaris or other os

1086830
linux	uname
one way i am thinking is of using the uname -a cmd to extraction the os information on a linux unix-based os

1086844
platform	gpl
also the gpl contains exception-handling for the base operating systemd which allows linking gpl software to the platform s non-free libs

1086844
platform	gpl
you might not be allowed to redistribute a gpl web-application and the platform together but a gpl web-application ported to websphere for example might still be gpl-compliant

1086853
temporary	copy
however this does not copy the page setup across - immeadiately after calling this function i call tmp.printpreview where tmp is a temporary worksheet and the output is the same as if i had never called the function

1086873
web-services	security
the use of web-services tends to be safer although security is often more a people issue than software issue

1086873
client-server	web-services
web-services are better for client-server applications where users should not have direct access to the database

1086895
reflection	runtime
the asp.net-mvc runtime uses reflection to determine which controllers a request must be passed to based on the router information and it is finding two controllerss that match the criterion have the same named and each is in a different assembly

1086901
value	field
i m trying to get the value of a few checkbox and enter them in a hidden form field

1086901
hidden-field	checkbox
i only need to submit the hidden-field data .so i d like the value of the hidden-field change .when the checkbox is ticked

1086901
hidden-field	checkbox
.so if the first checkbox is ticked i d like the value of the hidden-field to become chicken and if both of them are ticked the value should be chicken meat

1086904
hide	show
but basically you can bind some value trough a valueconverter to the uielement.visibility properties if what you want is to hide show any uielement

1086909
exception-handling	error-handling
i actually have two questions regarding exception-handling error-handling in the iphone .app that i am making

1086918
security	esapi
now i looked into owasp.org s esapi security libs and in the python ports it had the following code

1086918
security	esapi
my question is here why did they include b t in the esapi security libs

1086919
macros	vba
they range from building a macros in outlook using vba to building full blown vsto addins

1086919
macros	vba
if you know vba it is easy to knock something up first with a macros

1086934
fckeditor	wysiwyg
as for the quality of the code they generator tools such as fckeditor and tinymce are very mature and do a good job of editing out the irrelevant crud in the source code but be prepare to provide support for clients using a wysiwyg .when their content doesn t look the way they would like it to

1086950
udp	tcp
i need to intercepts all tcp udp packets and potentially filtering or substitute them with new ones

1086957
constructor	object
another used practice is a constructor that takes an object of this types new arraylist anotherlist

1086991
copy-constructor	shallow-copy
you ve got a few options implements cloneable add a copy-constructor but my preferred way is to use a methods static or instances that has a named which is descriptive of what the copy operation is doing - is it a deep or shallow-copy etc

1087000
32-bit	64bit
unfortunately again if you are going from a 32-bit process to a 32-bit process or from a 64bit process to a 64bit process things are quite straightforward but from a 32-bit process to a 64bit process things can get a little hairy

1087000
32-bit	64bit
you may have success by trying to force virtualallocex to allocate its memory in the bottom 4gb of the 64bit memory spaces .so that the resultant pointers is valid for the 32-bit process api call and then write with that pointers

1087000
alignment	layout
with rect there is no problem but some other struct with packing or alignment issues might need to be manually written field by field to the 64bit process inorder to match the 64bit struct layout

1087003
value	field
if your primary key field have automatic identifier then you might well be able to scripting to interogate the systemd for field which are not in the pk and use the existing value for those that are not and only insert those ones or to insert null for the pk field

1087007
duplicates	lookup	membership	guid
my plan is .when a user wants a username and passwd they register and the information is insert into asp.net_membership and then duplicates their guid username createdate into the new user table .so that in the code i can just lookup data in the user table and it will not matter if they registered with openid or asp.net membership

1087014
selected	checkbox
the following example show you how to determine if the checkbox in a particular row is selected or not

1087052
contains	elements
for me this looks like allelements contains none displayobject elements

1087054
put	get
i get an error saying can t find dependent libs unless i put the path of the other dll on the systemd path variables i m on windows-xp

1087058
twitter	tweets
oauth is designed for authentication to take actions on your behalf .so that stackoverflow.com or wherever can ask permission to say tweets on your behalf automatically without knowing your twitter passwd

1087066
calloc	malloc
the intent is to have operators new implementable by calling malloc or calloc .so the rules are substantially the same

1087076
sql-server	oracle
my company is now supporting oracle for the first time and most of my colleagues are sql-server developers who haven t really worked with oracle

1087076
sql-server	oracle
the biggest problem that i run into is in knowing how sql-server terminology translation into oracle terminology

1087076
sql-server	oracle
i understand that there s not a direct 1 1 mapping of terms but it would be helpful to be able to know how to put oracle concepts into sql-server terminology and vice-versa .when talking to my sql-server-centric co-workers

1087076
sql-server	oracle
can someone tell me the best way to put these sql-server terms into oracle terminology

1087076
sql-server	oracle
and conversely how to explain these oracle concepts in sql-server terms

1087101
required	checked
use dependency walker to checked if there are any files required by mynativedll.dll

1087116
downgrade	upgrade
although it does not directly support neither views nor sprocs it supports running native sql-scripts as part of an upgrade downgrade process

1087117
connection-pooling	pool
if you use a connection-pooling and the maximum numbers of connections is reached the next request is put on a pending while either a connection is returned into the pool or a timeout is reached

1087174
base-class	inherited
.when i inherited from the columnbarbaseseries ... base-class i have to overrides getaxes and updatedatepoint which i am not sure how to implements

1087184
if-statement	loops
if you are looking at if-statement or loops nested more than 2 deep seriously consider refactoring

1087218
put	get
put an id on the tag you want to get its data from

1087224
required	checked
we ve created an intranet site that required the same passwd as the user s network login .so we use ldap to checked the username passwd

1087227
http	ssl
i need to write a scripting that connect to a bunch of sites on our corporate intranet over http and verifies that their ssl certificates are valid

1087227
http	ssl
python by default just accepts and uses ssl certificates .when using http .so even if a certificate is invalid python libs such as urllib2 and twisted will just happily use the certificate

1087231
sql-server	oracle
migrating from oracle to sql-server

1087231
sql-server	oracle
sql-server migration assistant for oracle

1087237
double	int
they re more like int with a scale than float double types

1087237
decimal-point	digits
.so a numbers 10 3 has 10 digitss 3 after the decimal-point which is really a 10 digits int with a scale of 3

1087253
execute	declare
execute declare r int

1087259
windows-server	windows-xp
2000 windows-xp windows-server 2003

1087259
windows-server	windows-vista
windows-vista and windows-server 2008

1087260
digits	base
oracle numbers types are stored as sets of centesimal digitss that is base 100 not base 10 one digits per byte

1087278
python	c++
if it were written in something like c++ i would have to embed a python interpreter in the application

1087284
expression	evaluation
a python parsing read this input file and obtained the final data evaluation the value and the expression using eval

1087293
xsd	xml
xml in a nutshell third edition show an example on page 282 where there is an anchor tag in an xsd box but does not recommend specifically what to do in cases of the documentation contains examples of the schema being used

1087315
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
since the .text properties is on a control inherited from webcontrol it can be set read manipulated during any of the events following the control s load event wherever whenever you load the control inside the page but the text cannot be directly read used manipulated by the code-behind without referencing some other control to get to it like a contains div s innerhtml properties

1087329
reflection	runtime
if you are looking for a way to access properties of a struct or class at runtime without predefining in code that set of properties what you probably need to use is reflection

1087352
convenience-methods	initializer
setup and teardown are convenience-methods - they shouldn t attempt to do much more than initializer a class using its default-constructor etc

1087353
selected	button
if you want to have the customers selected where to save then use a savefiledialog of your own in the button s click event

1087356
xsd	xml
.so while you may use arbitrary well-formed xml inside i would advise against it - because .some automatic documentation tool using the xsd may choke on it

1087358
default-value	default
the default-value by default will be null that means the right hand side of the assignment will be null and you are trying to cast null to a long

1087366
compatibility	deprecated
marking the old apis deprecated works while maintaining compatibility

1087371
linux	unix
there are many abstraction libs out there which work equally on windows linux unix or mac os

1087373
javascript	dom
in javascript i have an xml dom

1087416
linux	unix
i think in a linux environment - and i m assuming linux unix because you mentioned qt - that you could probably string together a couple of n x command-line apps

1087421
easymock	mockito
you need to provide expectationss for each methods that is called with the expectations on any concrete methodss calling the super methods - not sure how you d do that with mockito but i believe it s possible with easymock

1087467
export	csv
the simplest technically way is to export the contents as a csv and use sql-loader to import it into the table

1087472
triggers	insert
assuming your using mysql 5 or greater you could create a triggers which would fire upon insert into a specific table

1087472
triggers	insert
note that an insert triggers also fires with the load cmd

1087501
abstract-class	subclassing
instead i suggest defining a non-abstract subclassing of your abstract-class in your test

1087503
python	java
i use setup quite frequently in java and python frequently to set up collaborators either real or test depending

1087503
constructor	object
if the object under test has no constructor or just the collaborators as constructor i will create the object

1087523
implements	sealed
here is some code that appears to work for me to implements your own commandcolumnseries i stole a lot of it from the source for the columnseries sealed class

1087549
erlang	ada
would erlang compiled using ada be noticably better or worse than the erlang made with c

1087553
required	checked
disadvantages some logic required .when modifying the set checked whether newly insert or modified range intersect

1087556
swing	swt
you realize of course that swt is not portable the way that swing is

1087559
multithreading	wait
an alternative but more complicated design is to multithreading your application to maximize throughput and avoid wait time

1087564
sql-server	mysql
i use enum in mysql but i am not sure if this exists in sql-server

1087564
sql-server	mysql
i am not sure if there is some sql-server specific way of doing this since i use mostly mysql

1087574
put	get
according to the kigg sample asp.net-mvc web project you can get it from the official asp.net they put extension utility classes with a subfolder under root

1087582
latitude-longitude	location
but what do i use to make the vectors and how do i reference the same location on the image at different zoom levels since i am not using latitude-longitude coordinates

1087607
subclassing	nsobject
it default to subclassing of nsobject just selected the one that you want from the menu and you are good to go

1087610
show	next
if he enters 1 foot 14 inches should it should 2 feet 2 inches the next time the measurement is show

1087615
erlang	ada
writing erlang extensions might be much harder if it was written in ada simply because fewer people are conversant with the language

1087625
getattr	setattr
for many tasks i ve seen people ab- use execute and eval for python powerful built-in such as getattr and setattr indexing into globals c provide preferable and in fact often simpler solutions

1087659
radio-button	button	radio-button	selected	selected	button
in flex sometimes .when you need to clear a form you run into the problem that radio-button groupinging seem to defy clearing try as you might setting selected false on all button setting selection null on the grouping doing both doing them twice etc. you always seem to end up with one pesky little radio-button that s still selected

1087683
radio-button	selected
the only way to solve this that i know of is to add a hidden dummy radio-button that you selected inorder to deselected all the others

1087688
radio-button	selected
selected the treat warnings as errors - all radio-button in the building tab of the project s properties

1087705
spacing	layout
it lets you layout components left-to-right or top-to-bottom with the tightly coupled box class to force spacing constraints

1087728
any	set
it actually shouldn t cause any problems to use non-ascii characters in html or css but using the wrong character set can lead to unwanted display effects

1087734
multiplying	subtract
to get the minutes figure subtract the whole numbers portion .so you only have the amount after the decimal then multiplying the fractions by 60 to get the minutes

1087767
moss	wss
we re in the middle of a transitions from wss -- moss and i need to be able to support report on both

1087771
decrement	increment
.so to the question .when i was learning multithreading in c++ i was taught that you didn t need to synchronized call to increment and decrement operations because they were always one assembly instruction and therefore it was impossible for the thread to be switched out mid-call

1087773
sql-server	postgresql
if you aren t tied to sql-server postgresql has great support for this kind of thing via an arrays

1087782
conditional	operators
a ++ operators is not atomicity in c# and i doubt it is guaranteed to be atomicity in c++ .so yes your count is subject to race conditional

1087786
selected	textbox
whenever a textbox gains control it will al.so selected the text .so that any editing will replace the current one

1087807
selected	textbox
nicest way to implements automatically selected the text on receiving focus is to create a subclassing of textbox in your project with the following overrides

1087817
carbon	cocoa
don t forget to tell the srrecordercontrol to translation the modifiers flags from cocoa to carbon before you pass them to registereventhotkey

1087823
dictionary	arrays
he has a section on arrays and dictionary here s an excerpt

1087823
dictionary	arrays
arrays dictionary etc

1087826
dictionary	arrays
since collections classes arrays sets dictionary etc. handle retaining and releasing their contents all you have to worry about is retaining or releasing the collections itself

1087830
value	field
i need to convert a field with milliseconds created by php .app to a date value

1087841
decrement	increment
on some architectures like x86 there are single increment and decrement instructions

1087841
decrement	increment
even if the compiler could be guaranteed to always generator the memory versioning of increment and decrement on x86 that still does not guarantee atomicity - two cpu s could modify the variables simultaneously and get inconsistent results

1087844
swing	swt
in java desktop land you have 2 major choices swing or swt

1087848
decrement	increment
any kind of increment decrement operation in a higher level language and yes even c is higher level compared to machine instructions is not atomicity by nature

1087848
decrement	increment
if your lecturer was referring to machine instructions increment and decrement operations are likely to be atomicity

1087878
python	java
i m biased being a python expert but pretty rusty in java but i think the python runtime of gae is currently more advanced and better developed than the java runtime -- the former has had one extra year to develop and mature after all

1087878
ruby	php
how things will proceed going forwarding is of course hard to predict -- demand is probably stronger on the java side especially since it s not just about java but other languages perched on top of the jvm too .so it s the way to run php or ruby code on .app engine

1087878
python	java
vice versa if you loathe javascript but must execute some code in the user s browser java s gwt generator the javascript for you from your java-level coding is far richer and more advanced than python-side alternatives in practice if you choose python you ll be writing some javascript yourself for this purpose while if you choose java gwt is a usable alternative if you loathe writing javascript

1087878
python	java
in terms of libs it s pretty much a wash -- the jvm is restrict enough no threads no custom classloader no jni no relational db to hamper the simple reuse of existing java libs as much or more than existing python libs are similarly hampered by the similar restrictions on the python runtime

1087878
python	java
i think it s worth opening issues on the appengine issues page with xpath and xslt in their title -- right now there are only issues asking for specific libs and that s myopic i don t really care how a good xpath xslt is implements for python and or for java as long as i get to use it

1087878
python	java
last but not least remember that you can have different versioning of your .app using the same datastore some of which are implements with the python runtime some with the java runtime and you can access versioninging that differ from the default active one with explicit urls

1087878
python	java
.so you could have both python and java code in different versioning of your .app use and modify the same data store granting you even more flexibility though only one will have the nice url such as foobar..appspot.com -- which is probably important only for access by interactive users on browsers i imagine

1087883
stderr	stdout
data from stdout and stderr until

1087889
google-earth	openlayers
anything will suffice but stuff using the google-earth api as opposed to openlayers would be ideal

1087920
display	height
i m trying to get the total height of a page using javascript and jquery .so i can checked if the page is long enough to display .something however in my testing i am unable to get the total height of a page

1087924
sinatra	ramaze
you might also like to checked what are the main difference between sinatra and ramaze

1087934
sql-server	oracle
oracle sql-server

1087950
directory	folder
if your wanting to use the compressed folder option you will need to modify the directory flags on the directory handle

1087951
twitter	gmail
yet it is still useful for accessing the mobile web versioning of gmail google-reader facebook twitter and many more sites

1087982
32-bit	64bit
since collections such as use an arrays to store items that means that a .net application running on 32-bit will be able to hold twice as many reference-type items in a list compared to the same application running on 64bit

1088010
put	get
although it does work .when i put the html files out of views folder but i get page not found 404 .when i put those in views folder

1088010
directory	folder
i am also unable to browse the views folder by setting directory browsing option in iis

1088011
order	add
rather than a startorder methods that just creates an empty order followed by addlineitem call to add individual line items as you might do from a desktop-application i m recommending a single orderproduct methods that accepts an orderdto which will have a collections of lineitemdto

1088011
order	add
you ll send the entire order all at once add all the pieces in a transactional and be done

1088019
constructor	object
if overrides for your class isn t appropriate for example because there are multiple formats that you might want to printing and you want to write a different function for each one then you should either give up on the idea of operators chaining and just call the function or else write multiple classes that take your object as a constructor parameter each with different operators overloads

1088046
put	get
the deploy directory contains only those executable and dlls that are needed for the actual .app ie testing dlls don t get put there

1088066
deep-copy	object
this is not the nicest approach to copying object but the following is sometimes useful if you wish to perform a deep-copy of a serialization object

1088074
string.format	stringbuilder
however in this situation i highly recommend using string.format or a stringbuilder depending on the numbers types of operations to construct the result string from mixed types

1088077
sql-server	mysql
however i do not want to connect to a real mysql database but rather to a temporary one that doesn t required any sql-server at all

1088093
sql-server	mysql
i ve used python-mock and mox for such purposes extremely lightweight tests that absolutely cannot required any sql-server but for more extensive in-depth testing starting and populating a local instances of mysql isn t too bad either

1088096
perl	php
there should be a numbers of these to choose from for php and perl

1088113
account	userid
clarification -- inorder to find out a file s owner from a c program it should call stat which gives the userid of the owner and then use getpwuserid to get the account s named from the userid

1088129
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller does not neither does the uitabbarcontroller

1088135
shell	bash
in the bash shell surround arithmetic-expressions with

1088156
sql-server	oracle
here s my best guess and while it may turn out to be fast enough for my purposes i d love to learn a canonical way to basically do sql-server s exists in oracle

1088167
paintcomponent	draw
here is another thread in the sun forums that show something similar to what you are trying the developer overrides the paintcomponent methods on the jmenubar to draw an image

1088209
firefox	safari
interestingly enough it hits the error event in ie but not firefox safari and the rest and i don t know why this code works great and rendering my data just fine in firefox and the rest

1088231
contains	elements
you could use sed to batch-edit files contains the same page elements

1088235
reflection	runtime
i ve read that you can walk through reflection to get a runtime list of columns but i can t have that checked at design-time for a column named

1088272
versioning	upgrade
a little late but i just upgrade from isapi-rewrite versioning 2 to versioning 3

1088297
attributes	properties
i have a listener that watches all service looking for a properties attributes indicating this service should be exported made remote something like remotable true

1088308
primitive	int
in the case of a primitive types like an int calling its destructor just means that the memory it occupies will be release

1088330
constructor	private
you might make the no-arg constructor private

1088364
hidden-field	checkbox
i m try to count the numbers of checked checkbox if two are checked the price of the item in the hidden-field is â 3.00 and for any additional checkbox the price should be added by 1

1088386
python	perl	python	java
it also works with multiple-languages including java python perl etc.

1088386
python	c++	python	java
swig is also portable as your c++ code is - i use it myself on linux and windows to bridge our c++ code to java and python

1088387
emacs	vim
given what i just said what productivity advantages does vim or even emacs have over a gui text-editor aside from that fact that it is install on every computer

1088387
emacs	vim
i d like specific tasks that are better faster on vim emacs or that are just not possible with existing gui text editor

1088414
listbox	textbox
i also have a listbox with a bunch of data points which load new data into the textbox that are being validation

1088417
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera	h.264	webm
as well there s some fight over which codecs to support for the videos - firefox google-chrome and opera all support both ogg-theora and webm while safari and ie are shipping h.264 though either can support theora webm with proper codecs

1088417
firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
to add support for ie 8 and earlier and other downlevel clients like older versioning of firefox safari opera etc just put your standards video embed code inside the video tag below the source elements

1088424
windows-server	windows-vista
the only workaround is to run netcfsvcutil.exe on windows-vista sp1 or earlier or windows-server 2008 sp1 or earlier and then copy the generator client code to other machines

1088429
keyboard	mouse
i actually ended up going lefty on my mouse at work because it let me move my hand less to reach for the mouse my keyboard at home doesn t have a numbers pad .so i can keep it on the right

1088437
32-bit	64bit
i know from experience that trying to call a 32-bit dll from a 64bit wcf service doesn t work and i believe azure is a 64bit platform

1088439
keyboard	mouse
basically with a small lead-time you can learn ten or twenty keyboard shortcuts that mean you don t have to keep shifting your hand to grab the mouse

1088460
put	get
here are some of the errors i get the whole stack-trace is too big to put here

1088480

scala	java
is there a way to write scala code such that it will emit java enums on compile-time

1088615
extends	sealed
the approaches i tried .so far sealed case classes extends enumerator seem to generator normals classes which makes working with them from java much hairier than straight up enums

1088626
sunos	unix
we have a small daemons application written in c for a couple of various unix platform this problem is happening in sunos 5.10 that basically just opens up a serial-ports and then listens for information to come in via said ports

1088634
constructor	object
object returned from convenience constructor are already set to autorelease

1088634

buffering	streaming
for the latter i ve had good results polling a source for the al_buffering_processed properties .when i streaming buffering to a source

1088779
external	embed
i m guessing that what h.appens now the reason you wrote this question is you embed this .net .app into a portlet on your portal but .when someone tries to browse to it even though they are logged into your portal they see the external .net login screens inside the portlet box

1088793
constructor	object
what is a culture-invariant way of constructing a string such that the javascript date constructor can parsing it and create the proper date object

1088829
callback	methods
they have to implements the handler interface and .so they have to write a state machine class that responds to the callback methods

1088829
callback	methods
that will be no harder to write than the callback-interface approach - just yield return an object derived from my languageelement base-class instead of calling a callback methods

1088848
archive	backup
i have created a shell scripting to backup my webfiles + database dump put it into a tar archive and ftp it offsite

1088855
sftp	ftp
use ftp or rather sftp rather than http as a protocols for faster upload process

1088865
javascript	dom
if you have your javascript at the top of your page anything you run outside of document .ready will be acting against an empty dom because the browser has not had time to create the nodes yet

1088865
put	get
.so whenever you want to manipulate elements especially a query to get all the elements that have a title you definitely need to put the code around this special event

1088868
sigaction	signals
you didn t say how your signals handler is attached but if you re able to attach it using sigaction 2 .so as to get a siginfo_t then it looks like that would include the pid that sent the signals si_pid

1088906
checkbox	button
it also occurs to me that perhaps what i really want is a button control that looks like a checkbox maybe an invisible button with the usual animated checkbox on top which i bind data to the graphic of

1088916
hash	md5
.so is there anyway to get md5 to hash via a specific key that would be consistent to both

1088918
dialog	pop-up
i have a button which event is handled serverside and .when i click lthis button i want to pop-up a dialog where i can show my custom web control or any web control lets make it generics from the start

1088933
hash	md5
md5 is not encryption - it s a hash

1088933
hash	md5
you would then md5 the string or file and compare the hash you computed with the hash they sent

1088937
emacs	vim
in my experience the main productivity gains which vim and emacs i m a vim person myself but emacs is surely similiar provide are

1088937
emacs	vim
i don t know why that is or maybe i m just lucky but maybe people who took the barrier of getting accustomed to an old tool like emacs or vim have the right dedication and contact to other people like that

1088937
emacs	vim
maybe it s an indirect effect of these editor but hanging out with other vim or emacs people on irc turned out to be quite interesting since the same people were also quite interested in all kinds of software engineering or computer science issues

1088946
hash	md5
tom s right md5 is just a one-way hash you can t decrypt it

1088965
buffering	streaming
for one thing this may block if it s writing to the error streaming and has exhausted the buffering - you re not reading from the error streaming until the output streaming has completely finished

1088981
datagrid	textbox
i believe the datagrid is still turning the cell into a textbox but making it readonly

1088985
defined	declare
you should only need to defined the project with jar packaging and as it is the default you don t need to declare it

1088985

if you defined the application-client.xml in the src main resources meta-inf folder it will be include in the meta-inf folder of the final jar

1088989
any	set
use control.load event to handle any data binding operation based on the properties field set during the init event

1089026
factors	primes
the problem is that 3 is a primes which isn t a factors of 10

1089026
factors	primes
but .when you divide by a numbers which is primes and isn t a factors of your base you can run into trouble and will do .so if you try to divide 1 by that numbers

1089050
linux	unix
also is this unix linux or windows

1089050
linux	unix
if this is unix linux or some other pthreads platform the program may be looking for input on dev console instead of dev stdin for security reasons

1089054
mocking	stubs
after reading up on it there seems to be two schools of thought - either building off of httpcontextbase and use a mocking framework to generator the needed stubs mocks for your unit-testing or building agnostic wrapper classes around the areas of httpcontext which you intend to use

1089058

1089112
installation	building
we offer a teamcity installation with a numbers of building agents as a shared resource to a numbers of distribute technology departments across our mid-size company

1089142
dictionary	map
the primary structural difference between them is that dictionary relies on chaining maintaining a list of items for each hashtable bucket to resolve collision whereas hashtable uses rehashing for collision resolution .when a collision occurs tries another hash-function to map the key to a bucket

1089158
key-value	key
for clustered key this is far worse because the clustered key-value is used as the lookup value on all other non-clustered indexes .so it increases the size of all indexes

1089158
hash	md5
use a persistent md5 hash column

1089188
text-editor	editor
in addition to being easier to parsing than xml you can also use a plain old text-editor as a level editor

1089205
radiobuttonlist	gridview
if i have an asp.net radiobuttonlist within a templatefield in a gridview which is tied to a data control i can get databinding on page loading like .so

1089205
selected	button
what i m wondering is .when the save button is pressed and a postback occurs is there a way to automatically push these selected value back through to the datacontrol .so they can be saved or do i have to manually loops through all the grid rows and exract the chosen value like .so

1089228

perl	ruby
for the mandelbrot program the perl implementation completed 8 time faster than the ruby implementation

1089280
default-value	default
in other languages you would implements this simply by providing a default-value for the destination parameter but objective-c does not support default parameters.

1089299
reflection	runtime
subsequent code can t modify the list and mistakes will be caught at compile-time - unless you use reflection but then reflection could be used to circumvent runtime checked as well

1089349
downgrade	upgrade	versioning	downgrade	versioning	upgrade
even if you were to pick only one exact versioning to support and force everybody else to upgrade downgrade it s not true that flash is the same everywhere the flash plugins for ie and flash plugins for everybody else aren t even the same binary and yes it matters they access the network in different ways which was part of the cause of my ie7 f9 bug

1089380

in each case the value that we worked with had a finite representation in binary and .so the value output by the basic multiplication and addition operations al.so produced value with a finite representation

1089392
numeric	digits
even .when the mantissa can be expressed exactly .when just adding two numbers we can still get numeric loss if the mantissa needs too many digits to fit after normalizing the exponent

1089393
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
also don t forget html5 which now has integrated video elements supported by major browsers including firefox google-chrome and safari

and as said jon 3 is a primes which isn t a factors of 10 .so 1 3 cannot be represented with a finite numbers of elements in base 10

1089482
instances	destroy
before destroying a tthread object it is usually necessary to wait until the thread that called the tthread.execute methods finishes for only then can we be sure that for instances the object destroy inside the class s destructor are no longer accessed

1089490
directory	folder
i was then hoping to add an include directory pointss to that folder relative to the workspace but eclipse won t do that it seems to only want to points to thinks in home user workspace myprojectnamehere

1089498
32-bit	64bit
i think your unsigned code would be easier to read if it was explicit about which variables were 32-bit which were 64bit and whether the comparisons were signed or unsigned

1089507
g++	gcc
i would suggest installing cygwin and gcc g++

1089514
put	get
you get out of it what you put into it

1089546
order	add
if accessorder on a linkedhashmap is set to true and i access its keyset then proceed to add the keyset to a linked-list via addall do either of these actions mutate the order count towards an access

sql-server	oracle
in oracle varchar2 variables actually lose their trailing spaces unlike in sql-server

1089796
conditional-operator	operands
the conditional-operator doesn t consider what you assign the result to .so you have to cast either of the operands to datetime

1089804
launchd	daemons
you should make your daemons a proper launchd daemons stick a plist in libs launchdaemonss

1089804
launchd	daemons
you probably shouldnâ t be launchd the second daemons directly from your daemons

1089804
launchd	daemons
however as i said you shouldnâ t be launchd your second daemons using open or launch-services

1089804
launchd	daemons
for example itâ s often best to have your launchd daemons launchdd on demand rather than have them running continuously

1089805
text-editor	editor
someone can .post here a tutorial of how to develop a text-editor in evb embedded visual basic 3.0 because i hate to use microsoft pocket words to write my programs in python and i want to use the code to building a lightweight editor and in future building a developer editor for windows-ce

if you re really smart you ll have an arrays of shapes that you ll loops through calling the different area methods and showing that you get a different result depending on the runtime types of each shape

1089920
value	field
at step 1 you have two field named firstname and lastname and on the postback you simply use updatemodel wizard object to get the value in

1089920
hide	show
what you can do is use javascript to hide and show elements of the wizard .so that all entry field are on the same page

1089939
linqdatasource	sqldatasource
use a sqldatasource instead of a linqdatasource and put your selected statement into the selectedcommand properties

1089943

if you re speed-crazy 1 return num 1 2 inline it is legible and beats isodd somenumber because it avoids the python function-call

1089997
value	field
the validation works just like i want the error messages are configurable at least the value to the right of the labels it uses and the validation are .so easy to configure as they simple are annotations on the contactbean class field

i could get it into various stages of landscape but .when the orientation was rotated correctly the touch input and drag weren t

1090021
getter	setter
traditional object or bean with getter setter

1090027
put	get
the best optimization you can get is to not put the test into a function

1090045
variables	boolean
instead of creating a timer object every time a selectedindexchanged event occurs it s simpler to just put a permanent one on the form with the designer and have it checked a boolean variables in the class to see whether or not it should call the updating function

1090054
32-bit	64bit
of course the c versioning is limited to 32-bit int which can trivially be changed to 64bit int if you .so desire

1090060
gdal	ogr	geos	ogr	geos	gdal
geos for the geometry model and gdal ogr for a spatial data abstraction libs which supports raster and vectors

1090060
coordinate-systems	wgs84
by using these libs you will also be able to handle different coordinate-systems like transforming from to wgs84 since both of them use proj.4 under the hood

revision	svn
svn performance after many revision

1090123
put	get
if you put in the corresponding html and used you would get your newline

1090158
swing	awt
as far as .when awt may be more useful than swing -

1090158
swing	awt
some people prefer the native look of awt over swing s not quite there platform skins

1090158
swing	awt
there are better 3rd party native looking skins than swing s implementation btw lots of people preferred using awt s filedialog over swing s filechooser because it gave the platform file dialog most people were used to rather than the weird custom swing one

1090173
derived-class	base-class
in simpler terms the derived-class tries not to do what the base-class already does

1090182
player	movie
i realize the flash player s support on firefox is a little bit buggy updates the player several time some flash movie may still not appear blank but on ie it should work fine

latitude-longitude	location
is there any way to get the location of a cell phone latitude-longitude automatically .when the user views a webpage

1090193
client-server	webserver
it .sounds like rather than deploying a webserver to the client that you should take a look at a client-server types set up where the client al.so hosts a ports .so that it too can act as a server

1090210
hide	show
then just iterate over the returned arrays to do the show hide logic

1090220
controllers	routes
controllers actions - use the routes controllerss to do the redirect

1090238
twitter	tweets
this is what i did .when i had to develop a midlet twitter .app that call a wcf service to get friend updates .post tweets etc.

1090274
value	field
the default value fire .when the new list item is first opened for entry and there are no value in any field yet

1090274
value	field
i understand it is possible to make a calculated field based on a column value but in that case the field cannot be edited later

1090280
restructuredtext	wiki-markup
i ve looked at many different wiki-markup languages markdown restructuredtext etc but they are all extremely complicated for me to understand how it works since they must cover a large amount of tags and syntax i would only need the list parts of most of these but converted to python instead of html of course.

1090280
tokenize	parsing
i ve also taken a look at tokenize lexers and parsing but again they are much more complicated than i need and that i can understand

1090280
children	nodes
edit-1 yes the character at the beginning of the line matters from the required output from before and now it could be seen that the denotes a root nodes with children the + has children and the - has no children root or otherwise and is just extra information pertaining to that nodes

1090280
children	nodes
therefore the new requirement would be using only to denote a nodes with or without children and - cannot have children

1090282
sniffing	packets
or will it come down to sniffing packets and reverse-engineering the app-store protocols

1090305
scala	java

1090365
radio-button	button
first .when the user click the button it will populate a dynamic table with radio-button for the survey questionnaire inside a placeholder

1090367
attributes	properties
you can open the .designer.cs file and see how the attributes are used to map column named to class properties

1090370
linked-list	nodes
you can think of it as a linked-list in contiguous memory but instead of each nodes having a pointers to the next nodes you instead have the cb member which is the count of bytes that are contains the item .so you can add that to the base address to get the next item

1090380
while-loop	loops
the while-loop then loops as long as the soundfilesource has audio data

1090393
stateless	stateful
using a creation hook here isn t really the right way to go because you are trying to add stateful data and those hooks are really for stateless behavior

1090433
compatibility	platform
you ll want to look into the mono project -- this is a clr compatibility layer for multiple platform including windows

1090436
contains	any
this vbscripting will contains data as well as orentation on the columns in pivot fieldlist .but can any body tell me what scripting i should be using as i m very new to vb and object of excel

vbscript	jscript
to quote the feature list vbscript jscript delphiscript c++script or c#script. note it says c++script not c++

1090439
contains	set
i found the issue it turns out that it was due to the contains div being set to overflow scroll

1090441
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	firefox	opera	safari	opera
above code worked for ie7 ie6 firefox 3 google-chrome opera 10beta but not safari 4

1090453
arrays	loops
now loops through the other arrays and increment the count in hashtable if that char is present in it

1090455
python	c++	delphi	c++
most of the multithreading work i have done has been in c++ python or delphi object-pascal

1090455
callback	methods
.when the hosts thread completed execution of the methods if a callback was specified it would call that function but in the context of the original thread that called the methods not in the hosts thread context

1090477
constructor	object
one way there could be others is to pass the object that you would pass the instances of t to the constructor of

as far as i know there is no php interpreter for ruby .so your best bet would be to make an http-request from your ruby-on-rails .app to your php .app to get its output

1090550
reference-type	generics
.when writing generics that you want to behave differently for reference versus value-type i always just use where t class for reference-type and where t struct for value-type

1090573
buffering	streaming
with more complexity one could more accurately regulate the single streaming bandwidth but it gets complex .when considering socket buffering and such

1090573

1090621
wordpress	smarty
the frustration continue .when said hand built page needs to be reworked again to fit smarty templates wordpress generics cms

1090621
selected	cell
photoshop s tables by themselves are pretty much useless i agree but surely we can take this data and then selected a grouping of cell and say right this is a text div overflow auto or these cell are an image block styles it with the same height width as the selecteded area

1090637
contains	any
an example here would be on a debian-based systemd .when you apt-get install php-pgsql it will create a etc php conf.d pgsql.ini which will contains the line as well as any module-specific options

1090638
.when	ready
we wrap this in the ready function of jquery .so all call will only be made .when the document has fully loaded

1090641
delphi	c++
the choices were c++ mfc delphi and vb

instead i ll like to labels the submitted value with the id of the field

1090709

p.s yes i know i could set the named and id attributes of the field both as contact-named but how does two attributes that contains the same value be usefull

1090726

1090838
cvs	git
it will be used by extremely non technical people on windows .so i have ruled out svn cvs git etc

1091063
subclassing	superclass
basically you use the new modifiers .when the subclassing methods has nothing to do with the superclass methods

1091072
getter	setter
as i see it the setter and getter of the class has to be clean of all extra logic as the jpa implementation uses these to building up the object

1091072
transient	entity
maybe a nicer option would be to have transient functions inside the entity itself that does this

1091072
getter	setter
would it be better if the generics setter and getter be private for jpa and the classes would have a separate public transient api meant for the developers

1091073
constructor	object
if the constructor of an object fails to run then you do not have an object that needs to be dispose

1091073

subroutine	scoping
its scoping is limited to the do_something subroutine where it s created until it s returned and stored in ref

1092371
pointers	stack	malloc	free
as a more general rules never return a pointers to stuff allocated on stack ie not created using new or malloc because as .soon as the function ends the scoping of that variables al.so ends gets destroy .so you get a pointers to invalid free memory

1092398

last time i checked perl used reference-counting for garbage-collection .so that arrays will not be garbage-collected until the last reference to it goes out of scoping if you unset ref at the end of your example

1092473
updating	updates
the updates can use context sensitive subqueries and case construct to provide a lot of flexibility in terms of updating different rows in seemingly different ways

output	mode
if he only needs to see each item once instead of all of them together then he can save memory by process them in streaming mode using an output iterator of his own devising

1092572
abstract-class	pure-virtual
of course you can use the same pattern without using templates by taking a function pointers plus a user data pointers if desired as a parameter and calling it once with each item or by defining an intvisitor abstract-class with a pure-virtual member function and having the caller provide an instances of it

1092577
any	set
you want to set one up to do any process after the call

1093143
deep-copy	object
if your options object has other object nested within it you might need a deep-copy like this

1093160
python	java
performance java is potentially faster then python

1093160
python	java
memcached api java sdk have more interesting abilities than python sdk

1093162

pascal	delphi
change your delphi declaration to also be pascal instead of stdcall

1093270
administration	account
it is important that you setup at least two deployment administration in the event that one account is deactivated

1093424
linux	unix
dig is available on most linux unix boxes

1093440

there is nothing wrong with calling super within a constructor .so long as it is the first line in your constructor .so long as you are actually extends a class that has a non private constructor

1093440
constructor	private	extends	super
if the class you are extends has only one constructor and it s private then you can t call super

1093477
arrays	loops
loops through sorted arrays and output to file

1093484
.doc	docx
if you required that your users upload words 2007 docx files as opposed to words 2003 .doc files you can use the system.io.packaging api in windowsbase.dll to read the xml within the words 2007 file see here

1093509
attributes	properties
you can provide dynamic custom types information at runtime by implements the icustomtypesdescriptor interface - but this is quite a bit of work at not nearly as simple as decorating properties with attributes

1093551
arrays	loops
essentially i would pass the checkedbox as an arrays in .post and then .when you go to make them just make a loops that will make all the boxes you need and checked against .post to see if it s been checkeded or not

1093563
firefox	safari
it s working great in safari and firefox but for some reason in ie7 the hide action in jquery is not working properly

1093584
cvs	git	bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	version-control	bazaar	version-control	git	version-control	cvs
first there was a centralized model of version-control cvs svn and recently a distribute version-control model was created git bazaar hg

1093595
triggers	insert
.so for instances a last modified properties of the entity i could updates that using an on insert triggers in the database or i could do it in response to the propertieschanged event in the class itself having a class subscribe to its own event .sounds odd but since the class is in two files defined as partial-classes and one of those files is autogenerated by the ide doing it this way means i don t have to tamper with the autogenerated file .so it won t break if i have to regenerate the .dbml or i could do it in the .app .when the entity is submitted to the database

1093604
order	join
from cat cat left join cat.owner owner order by owner.name

1093616
push	pull
.something you could do...depending on how your current set up is arranged is have a computer of yours run a crontab assuming linux or .somethign similar and pull the raw videos upload to your site every .so often convert them and then push them back on to your site

1093622
decrement	increment
in ie6 and ie7 you can have bhos in each tab and maintain a global process-wide count of open tabs by atomically increment a count .when each bho gets construct and atomically decrement the count .when you get a dwebbrowserevents2 onquit messages

1093626
data-members	private
the friend keyword allows other classes to access private and protected data-members in c++

1093647
order	join
xml formatting aside it looks like what you want is to query the line item table and join the purchase order and customer tables on that

1093668
value	field
in my mind the ideal scenario would be one where the user-interface layer validation user submitted data for possible malicious input illegal value regex pattern matches and requser-interfacered field

1093675
value	field
typically i handle content validation in my data-layer -- field lengths null not null formats value etc

1093694
duplicates	elements
note that they really are duplicates for 2 synonymmappings with 3 collections elements each you would get 6 results 2x3 3 copies of each synonymmapping entity

1093710
hide	show
i have a div that i want to show or hide depending on whether a hyperlink is click

1093722
required	checked
also note that the latter methods will required you to checked for nul characters first just in case the string contains the entire buffering location and there were no nul characters at all

1093724
authentication	login
one way to do it is to add an authentication section in your web-config file that will trip the login page .when the user click the userlist link and the user is not logged in

1093729
selected	textbox
you would want a combo box on that form to selected from the namedd in your table and .when you selected a named it would updates a textbox with the address information

1093754
pointers	stack
what was happening was the variables was correct before the printf call but .when you call a function local-variabless get allocated on stack and deallocated upon return .so the variables that i had pointers to existed on stack before calling printf and was the memory was reallocated to printf .when the printf function was evoked thus overwritting the previous variabless

1093757
for-loop	loops
the main fix was that your 2nd for-loop as previously mentioned used i++ instead of j++ .so your loops were going crazy

1093768
url-encoding	url
20 is what you get with url-encoding .so this is what you should use if you are going to use it in a url

1093795
build-process	ant
have a make ant maven rake whatever target to generator the code as part of your build-process

1093795
environment	building
obviously this assumes you are not in a points and drool building environment -- i use ides at time but i really hate to rely on them to do buildinging

1093805
python	ruby
it then struck me that i could use a python or ruby bridge in cocoa which provide the added bonus of regular expression and superior string handling than the c based languages do

1093805
python	ruby
this made sense to me even though i have coded only small amounts of ruby and python because they are billed as string manipulation languages

1093805
python	ruby
or is my idea to use python or ruby class methods that return a concatenation or regex modified strings not as incredibly insane as it sounds

1093805
nsmutablestring	nsstring
adding a bridge would probably be much slower than simply using nsstring nsmutablestring

1093837
malloc	free
tracking that bug down can suck horribly and doesn t happen .when you re doing malloc and free

1093843
subtraction	addition
it can be very easy to make subtraction addition and vice versa for example

1093864
constructor	object
i passed this to a helpers function in another object from a constructor

1093864
constructor	object
of course after the constructor finished and returned the object was located in a very different location in memory and the pointers stored in the other object was no longer valid

1093867
python	ruby
i would avoid mixing languages particularly if you don t know python or ruby well

1093887
exception-handling	try-catch
you could put a try-catch around it to verify that an exception-handling is being throw

1093891
nsmutablestring	nsstring
using stringwithformat on nsstring or appendformat with an nsmutablestring as others have suggested is much more natural and not particularly hard to read

1093904
contains	elements
i want to find the rows in a table which contains a certain interesting elements

1093909
constructor	object
you could create a childelementfactory that takes a parent object in its constructor and uses it to set up the relationship

1093956
attributes	properties
has the properties really changed .when all of it s attributes are the same

1093958
protected	public
you can think of c++ as having a very primitive access-control systemd - either you can access all members friend or member function or you can access only public members everything else except... or you can access public and protected members ...special rules for inherited

1093958
protected	public
on the other hand clearly friend can be used to completely break encapsulation by naming every other class you can think of as your friend like making all your members public or package protected in java or making all your members public in c++

1093974
innodb	myisam
if i must switching to innodb - how do i configure innodb .so that it behaves as similar to myisam as possible think no transactional logical file structure etc.

1094169
order	add
since we now have a little more info i m going to stick with my previous answer it looks like you have a loads of tasks which need doing the best way to do a load of tasks is to add them to the threadpool and then just keep checked if they re done if tasks need to be done in a specific order then you can simply add the next one as the previous one finishes

1094193
progress-bar	progress

since i want to pull out the value for column1 and column2 and since both of these value are lookup on the same field table2.name i suspect i need to do inner selected

1094420
transcoding	flv
you could try transcoding to some intermediary format to get the sample rate converted and then transcode from there to flv

1094432
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome seem to rendering at the same speed using either append or innerhtml

1094443
contains	elements
everything will work perfectly for about a day then suddenly every call or nearly every call to the data-layer both ado.net and linq returns data that cannot be parsing by my code -- i ll get exception-handling like unable to cast object of types system.int32 to types system.string . or sequences contains no elements or indexoutofrangeexception or invalid attempt to call read .when reader is closed

1094445
linked-list	nodes
however this does not work either - it fails because the first nodes of llist2 is already in a linked-list

1094462
internet-explorer	google-chrome
since the issue exists only in your development-environment a workaround would be to use a browser that implements a private mode such as google-chrome s incognito mode or microsoft internet-explorer 8 s inprivate mode

1094484
linux	unix
in fact there s a unix linux cmd for it

1094529
cursor	row
instead try to do the updates with the cursor use exception-handling to catch the error and log all you need the row numbers it failed on etc

1094555
wmv	flv
i need to get the aspect-ratio from a multitude of video formats flv wmv mp4 .mov etc

1094558
windows-mobile	symbian
symbian and windows-mobile are simply out of the game

1094566
malloc	free
unlike for new delete there is no standards way to overrides malloc and free

1094566
defined	declare
if that doesn t work and portability is necessary first declare the functions then declare the defined

1094574
directory	folder
you can ignore other directory like a folder that contains generator .sources .so you don t accidentally commit them to vcs

1094631
python	php	python	java
it s probably best to write a scripting in the programming language of your choosing and run that scripting python php java anything

1094632
pc-lint	misra
then buy pc-lint or another static analysis tool to checked your code for misra and other rules

1094643
environment	building
in that environment you are better off with a scalability allocation like the one used in intel s thread building blocks or hoard

1094646
order	join
based on the fact that order of the join does matter in many cases - careful thought should go into how you re writing your join syntax

1094649
contains	elements
the two queries will produce the same results but there may be a difference in performance as the first query may perform slower than the second query in some instances .when table 1 contains only a subset of the elements in table 2 as the left join will be execute first - and only then intersect with table1

1094650
arrays	loops
index into an arrays of functions and apply the appropriate function for the desired loops index

1094655
matplotlib	scipy
i know that scipy has some signal-processing tools for wavelets in scipy.signal.wavelets and a charts can be draw using matplotlib but it seems i can t get it right

1094661
smartgwt	extjs
the difference being that if you run an extjs gwt application in hosted mode and attach your debugger you can see what extjs gwt is doing but with smartgwt you ll just see lots of idispatch call where it disappears into native javascript where your debugger won t be able to follow

1094671
backwards-compatibility	legacy
i m converting a legacy ibatis implementation to hibernate and for backwards-compatibility purposes need to present count of an object s collections rather than the collections themselves

1094682
dataadapter	datarow
i m using the dataset datatable dataadapter architecture to mediate between the database and my model object which have their own backing they aren t backed by a datarow

1094682
any	set
any row in the returned result set whose primary key corresponds to an existing row in the datatable will be used to updates that row and that row s state will always become datarowstate.modified even if the returned row is identical to the current row

1094682
any	set
any row in the returned result set whose primary key doesn t correspond to any existing row will be used to create a new row and that row s state will become datarowstate.added

1094682
any	set
any row in the datatable that doesn t correspond to a row in the returned result set will stay at datarowstate.unchanged

1094693
silverlight	wpf
there are some applications in silverlight 3 and wpf which communication with data web-services based on wcf

1094703
fseek	ftell
c is .so simple you just use fseek ftell and rewind

1094717
subtract	add
i could also split on . then subtract the decimal from zero then add that to the whole numbers .

1094753
any	set
you will need to set any file that uses that header to compile as arm since gcc does not allow you to switching backends inside a single compilation unit

1094765
rounding	currency
you want to round instead probably i hope that the numbers don t represent currency because then rounding gets a whole lot more complicated

1094767
spaces	output
which output stack overflow note the new spaces

1094787
credentials	security
then send this hash along with the credentials to obtain the security token

1094797
traffic	packets
on linux see netem the kernel already contains support for traffic shaping and can simulate high latency low bandwidth packets losses and all .sort of other adverse conditional even on a loopback device .so you don t need a real physical network to test across

1094831
assign	add
if you want the second run to append to appdelegate.products you should see if appdelegate.products already has object in it if .so don t assign a new arrays to it just add to them to it using nsmutablearrays s addobject methods

1094842
attributes	properties
the set attributes in the mapping file defined a properties that .when mapped to your entity must implements the interface

1094858
swing	awt
draw text along a curve with just awt and swing libs

1094893
python	java
i ve validation this successfully using python but having real problems with java 6.0 and xerces 2.8.1

1094894
post-increment	pre-increment
++x is called pre-increment while x++ is called post-increment

1094897
selected	button
how do i save the user selected value from the dropdownlistfor .when a button is click

1094899
shutdown	exit
one drawback in my opinion that you have to explicit shutdown and awaittermination them before you exit your application - which is not .so easy in gui apps

1094908
set	bag
no you cannot use set bag list idbag or map for non-collection properties on an entity

1094944
versioning	upgrade
this actually worked fine until i decided to upgrade ruby-on-rails to versioning 2.3.2

1094961
python	java
is there anything in python akin to java s jls or c# s specifications

1095006
calloc	malloc
the memory for the strings themselves must be allocated elsewhere either as static arrays or by using malloc or calloc

1095028
any	set
is there any way to persistent set the column widths on a delphi 2007 tshelllistview in vsreport mode using code

1095028
directory	folder
the normals shelllistview.columns 0 .width properties only sets the width for the current directory and that width is reset after every change of the current directory or refresh of the file list including refreshes and directory changes made via code the user double-clicking a folder etc.

1095033
google-chrome	firefox
i see the same thing as validome.org with firefox google-chrome and wfetch--that last of which blindly report the text obtained from the socket similar to libcurl or wget

1095034
getter	setter
in java classes is it considered good or bad practice to access member field with their getter and setter

1095037
arrays	map
an arrays of strings such that the enum value can be used as an index into the arrays or a map structure an nsdictionary that maps an enum value to a string work but i find that these approaches are not as clear as a function that makes the conversion explicit and the arrays approach although the classic c way is dangerous if your enum value are not continguous from 0

1095037
json	xml
formattypes is a types and the enum value json xml etc. are value that you can assign to that types

1095042
google-chrome	opera	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	opera
in firefox opera and google-chrome the centering panels has the intended scrolling behavior .when the class list exceeds the height the centering panels has a scrollbar

1095045
firefox	safari
.so for example you would create an application on the iphone that has the embedded safari browser however any website the user visits with this browser wouldn t know you were on safari on the iphone it would think you are on .something like safari on a pc or even ie firefox

1095050
getter	setter
i don t see how there can possibly be any harm in defining getter and setter

1095056
getter	setter
if you know you are changing the value from outside the class and only then provide a setter if you don t know make the variables private and if you need access later maybe provide a getter or a setter

1095056
getter	setter
having a getter and a setter without thinking about it for every member break encapsulation and is not a good design choice

1095066
getter	setter
many time have i been saved from the pain of rewriting a class just because i left a getter or a setter open to overrides

1095066
value	field
.so unless you re ab.solutely certain that there is only one way to access that field and that it s 100 direct it s probably best to decouple the retrieval and modification of value .so that at .some future points you can save yourself from rewrite hardship

1095070
getter	setter
it depends on what you use your getter and setter for

1095070
getter	setter
in that respect i really use getter and setter as an interface layer between this class and other classes that might need access to its data

1095070
getter	setter
i tend to write my internal code such that it knows how to handle data private to this class .so accessing it with its own getter and setter is generally unnecessary and undesired

1095070
getter	setter
it all depends on how you use your getter and setter though

1095074
getter	setter
my rules of thumb is that if they do anything more complex than just set or return the value use the setter getter

1095086
getter	setter
i would say that using getter and setter internally is not an anti-patterns or a pattern

1095091
hash	md5
to handle that i d named each file there with by append the date and usernamed to the original file named and taking the md5 or sha1 hash of that string

1095116
versioning	upgrade
adobe can add new features and new codecs to video a lot quicker to a mass audience generally under a year over 90 of users upgrade to the latest versioning of flash compared to browser vendors there s still a large numbers of ie6 users out there and that browser came out in 2001

1095118
sql-server-express	sql-server
if you have a sql-server you can downloading microsoft sql-server-express for free you may want to look into the pivot function

1095120
getter	setter
have getter and setter

1095135
getter	setter
it sounds to me like some people are interpreting this question as being about getter and setter that are used external

1095146
contains	elements
try specifying the height of the body or some contains elements

1095150
directory	folder
an alternate approach is to start with a directory in your project with some files drag it into xcode and have it create the folder references for you

1095152
delphi	c++
the tutorial is written in c++ but near the end you can downloading the source of a delphi versioning

1095160
shell	bash
if your shell supports defining functions bash korn etc. then you could put it in a function and have each scripting include import whatever that file that the function is in

1095161
i2c	spi
you need to understand busses and interfaces spi i2c usb ethernet etc

1095161
ethernet	packets
state-machines very useful with bytestreamings serial and ethernet design packets structures that streaming well and are tailored to a state machine and that have a header and checksum or other structure that insures you do not interpreter partials packetss or

1095164
installation	upgrade
if there are security issues or bugfixes you will need to ensure that you patch or upgrade your ruby installation reasonably quickly

1095169
base-class	inherited
i think you are using inherited incorrectly if you have completely unrelated classes like numbers and color all deriving from the same base-class

1095171
subclassing	superclass
you want object to implements an interface contract not to be a subclassing of any arbitrarily chosen superclass

1095176
selected	button
basically it s as simple as it sounds user selected some text click a button or whatever and the text gets replace with some other text the initial case is that same text wrapped in some html tags

1095200
javascript	dom
then in the onchange event handler use some javascript parsing to figure out where the rows and columns line up create the html table and inject it into the dom

1095205
toolbar	tabs
the problem is the above only applies to the tabs div while the toolbar stops working

1095225
constructor	object
if .so am i allowed to lock out copy constructor for object that will be throw

1095243
json	xml
but if you wrote your own notes .app you could sync it with a webserver via xml or json then import the data into your delphi .app

1095246
button	popup
the user click on a button on the page the server generator a customized data file based on some of his her account settings and other parameters and then the save as... dialog should popup

1095248
deployment	install
for .net i use visual-studio for the application development and deployment i make a new vs project to building the deployable ms install

1095250
webserver	upload
passwd protected the directory that the files are upload to with .htaccess owned by root .so the webserver cannot possibly overwrite it

1095268
aggregate	grouping
however i can t return everything i want to show the user in one call because i subdivide the original resultset into pages and just return a specified page and i also need to take the original entire dataset and apply grouping by s and join etc to calculate related aggregate data

1095273
value	field
how can i get the value of the slider and updates field

1095291
click	mouse
.when a region of the pop-up lies outside the bounds of the taskpane click the mouse in that region

1095291
keyboard	mouse
the entire taskpane loses keyboard focus to words s main windows but retains mouse capture

1095291
keyboard	mouse
at this points you can use the pop-up with a mouse while typing on the keyboard edits your document

1095293
input-field	selected
if you want to updates another input elements why not hook up the change event for your selected and use it to updates your input-field

1095305
base-class	inherited	derived-class	inherited	derived-class	base-class
in other words the derived-class s __index table inherited the base-class s __index table

1095313
sql-server	mysql
i make some test with subsonic sql-server and mysql and with some little changes in the web-config file everything was good

1095313
sql-server	mysql
with the sql-server or mysql everything is good.the class cargo appear

1095322
buildpath	libs
properties - java buildpath - libs the messages unable to get systemd libs for the project is display

1095322
buildpath	libs
on a working project properties - java buildpath - libs has an entry for android 1.1 which if i click edit has the classpath containers path of com.android.ide.eclipse.adt.android_framework

1095326
ndepend	ncover
what does a performance analysis tool think of the code ndepend ndoc ncover etc.

1095332
any	set
i set it up on my windows machine a while back but i don t remember encountering any problems

1095357
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

1095360
tuples	set
note that a conditional evaluation on a set works the same as for lists and tuples

1095360
any	set
true if there are any elements in the set false otherwise

1095372
visualvm	jvm
is there some way to get jvm to collect some cpu profiling snapshot which i can later analyze with visualvm

1095377
twitter	tweets
i m using the scripting below to display my twitter status but would like to add the option to not display tweets that start with a username

1095385
arrays	loops
then i d append a function-call which loops through the arrays and call each function to the event through jquery

1095387
callback	methods
.when the event fired i would iterate over the arrays calling my object s specialized methods that took a callback

1095422
variables	boolean
you can do that toggling by setting a boolean variables or some other creative means

1095437
windows-vista	windows
for windows-vista apps i would also include windows user experience integration guidelines

1095445
itemscontrol	tabcontrol
after import her dragdrophelper and adorner classes it s very simple to use them with the tabcontrol since it is a descendant of itemscontrol

1095452
directory	folder
inside the project directory create another folder called build_output

1095457
core-animation	core-graphics
drawing with core-graphics is not too slow because core-animation intelligently caching the layer

1095461
variables	boolean
checkbox for two boolean variables that are part of the object

1095461
variables	boolean
the checkbox should allow the user to click on them and change the boolean variables which would then be saved to the main object collections

1095462
short	base
in fact some would argue that any comment is a code-smell and that descriptive named and short routines are more readable and prevent the situation where code has been changed but the comments haven t been updates which has certainly bitten me in a few legacy code base

1095500
32-bit	64bit
on 64bit there will not be the same 32-bit memory limitations 2gb max memory theoretical but 1.2-1.6 in practice

1095500
32-bit	x86
if the application is targetting x86 it will run under wow64 and act nearly identically to how it will act in 32-bit systemd

1095529
exception-handling	try-catch
also try placing a try-catch block around every service operation and wrap those exception-handling in faultexception-handling

1095546
webrick	thin
.so i m just trying out ramaze for a new project and i m wondering why it won t work with thin but will with ramaze start which is webrick i guess

1095561
32-bit	64bit
see msdn migrating 32-bit managed-code to 64bit

1095561
32-bit	64bit
different between 32-bit and 64bit

1095561
32-bit	64bit
back to basic 32-bit and 64bit

1095571
arrays	loops
that s a minimum of 5 queries all the data of those queries transfer back to the .app then the .app has to intensively compare all 5 arrays to each other loops galore

1095573
buffering	streaming
in that case is there anyway to streaming the file and not cause it to buffering for that long

1095581
margins	padding
the margins and padding must be set to 0 to prevent autoscroll in firefox

1095582
contains	set
you should set all the containsers that contains the div to height 100 as well including the body and html tags

1095585
buffering	capture
have a capture ram mechanism to copy the heap and memory content to persistent-storage hard disk or equivalent to detection and debugging deadlock livelocks memory-leaks buffering overflows etc

1095588
getter	setter
it is good to be able to differentiate getter and setter in technical conversation

1095590
subclassing	superclass
because it is in the superclass you now won t have to make yet another copy of it if you decide later to make a new subclassing that uses this methods as well

1095596
contains	elements
you can only meaningfully use height 100 if its contains elements s height is definided

1095603
execute	declare
you can also use specifications to declare specifications and execute them as junit tests with maven

1095607
decrement	increment
assuming you have a count field on stoneplacement to increment and decrement

1095615
double	int
of course this is not valid in my context in the example i just considered int or double as the datatype i m parsing the symrec properly but in this scenario won t the destructor dealloc 2 leaving as some kind of dangling-pointer

1095682
ruby-on-rails	django
i ve recently become interesting in web development again just started playing with frameworks like django and ruby-on-rails

1095686
hide	show
it seems that the show hide methods of the modalpopupextender are disabled .when there is an unhandled-exception

1095688
parentheses	macros
enclosing the named malloc in parentheses prevents the macros malloc from being expanded since it is a function-like macros

1095702
javascript	dom
overall i suggest you start with some trivial javascript applications then switching to jquery instead of going on to the complex topic of dom

1095707
contains	set
from what i ve been able to piece together technically a closure is simply the set of data contains the code of a function and the value of bound variables in that function

1095719
hide	show
i need to hide and show another question if user chooses another options

1095719
hide	show
option 4 of 2a - show q3 and hide q12

1095719
hide	show
option 1 of 2a - show q12 hide q3 and q4 --- this situation is quite complex

1095722
declarative	imperative
languages can have elements from different types of programming perspectives functional procedural imperative declarative etc

1095749
scheme	lisp
can i handcode some of these techniques in my lisp scheme program

1095760
scheme	lisp
can i see the translation machine instruction of a scheme function like disassembly in lisp

1095767
oracle	mysql
with mssqlserver and mysql the next configuration runs very well but with oracle donâ t

1095769
build-process	release
it was mentioned that they were working integration the source release into their build-process but this appears to have fallen through

1095780
ip-address	hostname
note that there is no way to adjust the dns servers to resolve the hostname to the same ip-address i checked

1095786
mechanize	hpricot	credentials	account
i ve written similar stuff to grab data from my bank account i m not too keen on giving mint my credentials using mechanize and hpricot as well as job sites used car dealerships etc .so it s flexible

1095790
ip-address	hostname
most ssl certificates are bound to the hostname of the machine and not the ip-address

1095828
perl	c++	python	c++	python	perl	python	java	dictionary	hashmap	dictionary	map
python has its dictionary perl has its hash java has a hashmap and many other types of maps c++ has std map though that is not backed by a hashtable and doesn t have constants time access

1095869
arguments	default
arguments if the closure needs to take only 1 param groovy and other langs provide a default named it to make coding quicker

1095873
arguments	default
for binding arguments a copy is a good default

1095876
value	field
also there is a field user_options which stores named value pairs of extra data

1095881
decrement	increment
you could defined two functions which close over a local variables increment decrement

1095881
decrement	increment
if you defined a new pair of increment decrement functions they would be sharing a different counter

1095882
double	int
int or double

1095883
python	ruby	python	c++	python	java	smalltalk	lisp
just as .when you are learning to program you are taught first c pascal then java c++ and finally python ruby smalltalk lisp and .when learning any language you start with simple language construct you should first learn ecmascript then learn dom and finally frameworks

1095891
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
developer.apple.com has most of the information you need to get started with developing for the iphone the elements application show you how to implements the uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller programatically

1095937
nsstring	nsobject
just cast your nsobject to an nsstring before calling the function

1095939
maven-release-plugin	release
we ve been experimenting with the hudson maven-release-plugin though i m a bit challenged with getting it to properly credit the release without evil things like hardcoding passwd into our building files

1095953
bug-tracking	trac
trac for bug-tracking tickets project milestones wiki etc

1095958
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
to learn javascript get crockford s javascript the good parts book and try to learn the language using a standards compliant browser say firefox with firebug safari google-chrome without focusing on dom-manipulation

1095958
javascript	dom
i would personally suggest that you try to do some dom-manipulation using bare bone javascript to get better understanding of the dom and the pain points involved

1095969
transparency	frame
i already have the images frame as png s with a transparency background and shadow alpha channel

1095988
line-endings	newline
be careful checked for newline that you know the format of your line-endings as unix and modern mac use n but windows uses r n and classic mac uses r

1096011
value	field
for lack of knowledge on a better methods i have concantenated all of the text value from the foreign criterion tables into one big field

1096016
beautifulsoup	mechanize
for very basic web-scraping checkout mechanize for basic web browsing and beautifulsoup for parsing html soup

1096073
directory	folder
how can i create a directory in c and assign an icons to the folder all with in my program

1096076
derived-class	base-class
static_cast is for converting between compatible types like a base-class to a derived-class

1096114
hide	show
small javascript code to show or hide the control

1096116
selected	cell
depending on what you do on the current view like selected a table view cell you can change whatever data you need in the prior view controllers and then call

1096138
carbon	cocoa
i have only used the carbon emacs on the mac but i can not imagine there is anything in the cocoa emacs that is any different than any other emacs versioning that can not be traced down to either a configuration or a bug

1096146
.net	wcf
wcf on .net cf is different

1096146
.net	wcf
it is a very limited ports of wcf and there are actually things you can do with the old web client that you can t do with wcf on .net cf in the old web client you can use windows-authentication with both http and http

1096146
.net	wcf
with wcf on .net cf you can only use windows-authentication with http

1096146
.net	wcf
even if you use the old web client technology on .net cf you can still talk to wcf service

1096159
linux	unix
on unix linux

1096160
contains	any
i suspect that you should be fine with alignment issues since your struct contains unsigned chars which can be aligned at any byte .so the compiler won t insert any packing between the members but strictly speaking this is implementation dependent .so use caution

1096171
msbuild	nant
can anyone please help me in converting the below nant scripting to msbuild scripting

1096176
revision	svn
svn types repository revision numbering confuses government customers who expect mil-std

1096198
python	ruby
ruby like python has a min methods for enumerator .so you don t need to do a .sort

1096210
python	c++	dictionary	hashmap	dictionary	map
i d have the temp controllers through a getstate methods return a map in python a dictionary in javascript an object in c++ a std map or std hashmap etc etc of its properties and current value -- what s convoluted about it

1096215
jquery	dojo
of course you can implements that javascript+ajax with dojo jquery naked javascript not recommended or any other framework or lack thereof but you do have to push suitable javascript to the client and serve the resulting ajax request from the server

1096219
exception-handling	try-catch
also always place try-catch in your end caller apps inorder to manage exception-handling

1096232
linked-list	nodes
well this is an issue because the purpose of the add nodes function was to dynamically allocate a new nodes at the end of the linked-list

1096244
getter	setter
you can extends the idea to readonly and write only properties by removing getter or setter from the class as appropriate

if you are not wanting to stretch the image but more some of the background-image is cut off then expand the height of the elements that has the background with the css properties width or height

1096346
any	set
it works without any error but i have no proxy set on my machine you may have to tweak few constants to get it right

1096349
32-bit	64bit
knowing that what you are doing is heavily implementation dependent here is one option that should compile and work assuming 32-bit pointers use long-long for 64bit on most platform even though it is clearly undefined-behavior according to the standards

1096357
hide	show
ultimately it might be better if you could keep the show hide functionality on the client-side completely

1096364
show	next
.so all string before first ol and after last ol or all string between ol and next ol will be deleted or not show

1096387

duplicates	sorted
my problem is quite similar to this question but i don t need the list to be sorted by time and i don t want duplicates

1096410
xsd	xml
my confusion is i am using .net c# xmlserializationr to serialization a customize defined types using the schema cs file generator by xsd tool from an input original xml file

1096410
xsd	xml
here is how i use xsd tool to generator schema file and cs file for the customized defined types from xml input file xmlfile1.xml

1096425
text-editor	editor
if it does and you don t need any of the custom formatter it defined you can examine it with plist editor or any text-editor it s probably safe to trash it

1096436
google-chrome	firefox
i am using mozilla firefox and google-chrome in both its not working

1096438
decrement	increment
instead of count the numbers of rows at lookup time consider increment a counter on recording insert and decrement that counter on recording deletion

1096438
decrement	increment
depending on your architecture it might make sense to use a caching layer like memcachingd to store increment and decrement the denormalization value and simply fall through to the slow count query .when the caching key is missing

1096439
udp	tcp
android s java.net package is pretty much the same as java s .so you can use .socket s and server.socket s for tcp communication or a datagram.socket for udp

1096451
order	add
a very simple way to do this without using timestamps would be to have an orderdictionaryionary where you have the mru at the end this is .when a request for the same object comes a second time you delete it and add it up again at the end of the dictionary .so .when you need to expire you just remove a splice of size x from the beginning of the order dictionary if the size is greater than the limit

1096474

you will also need to set the namespace of your classes and or properties using the xmlroot and xmlelement attributes

1096498
pascal	delphi
as much i know pascal as the base of delphi does not provide very easy approach as the best could be tstream or tpipeline usage tsocket should not be good right

1096558
hash	md5
this is basically a math problem but very programing related if i have 1 billion strings contains urls and i take the first 64bit of the md5 hash of each of them what kind of collision frequency should i expect

1096567
flying-saucer	itext
though it was originally intended for embedding markup into desktop applications things like the itunes music store flying-saucer has been extended work with itext as well

1096574
web-config	app-config
any new endpoint configuration info will be saved into your app-config web-config as appropriate

1096596
hash	md5
if the first 64bit of the md5 constituted a hash with ideal distribution the birthday paradox would still mean you d get collision for every 2 32 url s

1096632
json	xml
if you do want to do it by hand you would use nsurlconnection to downloading the data and then whatever you need to parsing the output nsxmlparsingr for xml a bit harder for json

1096643
accessor	ivar
the properties and synthesize make the accessor declarations and implementation for the already declare ivar

1096643

1096670
postdata	request
it turns out yahoo.util.connect has a setform methods to serialization a form but that still leaves me out cold to encode parameters for get request or the 4th parameter of yahoo.util.connect.asyncrequest to pass postdata

1096672
linux	unix
if linux unix checkout man pg_dump

1096674

internet-explorer	firefox
because firefox is better than internet-explorer

1096712
32-bit	64bit
p invoke in the cloud will work with 64bit but not with 32-bit since all our vms run win 2k8 x64 by default

1096716
file-access	filesystems
for file-access the os needs access to a disk drivers which needs to know how to read the filesystems that s on the disk there are a lot of different kinds sometimes the os has one built-in but i think it s more common that the bootloader hands it one to start with and it loads another bigger one

1096718
while-loop	for-loop
you can t possibly get any reasonable performance increase if you change say for-loop to while-loop

1096722
binary-tree	linked-list
as far as i know malloc asks the operating systemd for memory and then adds it to a linked-list or binary-tree or something

1096725
binary-tree	linked-list
as far as i know malloc asks the operating systemd for memory and then adds it to a linked-list or binary-tree or something

1096725

1096824
debugging	exit
visual-studio building the entire solution .when i exit debugging mode

1096824
asp.net-mvc	wcf
this is very annoying as the solution contains 42 project asp.net-mvc iis hosted wcf silverlight apps and others and the build-process locks visual-studio for aprox

1096828
contains	elements
using a sax parsing you will get an elements callback contains the elements named and the list of attributes

1096834
python	php	python	java
i ve decided in favour of java instead of a scripting-language php python .so that i can have the benefit of compilation and do not have to fear to write .something in the common libs which can triggers a fatal-error and stop execution of the scripting

1096880
value	field
secondly and that seems to be even more important it looks to me like you have a sql-injection vulnerability because you pass the field value directly to mysql without using mysql_real_escape_string first

1096899
revision	updates
suppose you updates your code to revision 10 which is broken

1096901

.when someone fixed revision 10 and commit 11 you can updates normally and merge in your changes from your local copy of r9

1096925
.when	ready
.when you are confident that the trunk is ready for your changes it is fixed merge your branch back in

1096929
factors	primes
this second example prompt us to think about factors and we can see that for any rational assumed to be in lowest terms we can answer the question by comparing the primes factorisations of b and q

1096929
factors	primes
if q has any primes factors not in the primes factorisation of b we will never be able to find a suitable n to get rid of these factors

1096929
factors	primes
thus for base 10 any p q where q has primes factors other than 2 or 5 will not have a terminating representation

1096929
factors	primes
.so there we have the answer to your question - because the primes factors of 2 are a subset of the primes factors of 10 all 2-terminating numbers are 10-terminating numbers but not vice versa

1096942
mouseover	mouseout
i have a menu in a masterpage which uses images and mouseover mouseout events for design purposes

i tested with a very short snippet if this works in ie firefox and google-chrome - and it does

1097252
ruby-on-rails	grails
i have the feeling that grails is far from reaching a critical mass and it still remains very obscure in the past few months i had the opportunity to work with middle size companies and it startups working mostly with the jvm stack and only one person knew and used grails and i am not even sure if it can become the ruby-on-rails of the java world indeed report a drop of growth in the last few months even if other frameworks have a positive growing rate

1097268
updating	updates
second-level caching is only appropriate if there is no underlying service updating your data - if all database updates go via nhibernate then it is safe

you would need to explicit supply the field named for the key .when you supply replacement value therefore a standards way is simply not possible

1097346
.when	ready
- i can t get to know .when the printer is done printing and if i try printing two or more tickets in a row the printer will return a printer not ready messages

1097359
compatibility	legacy
you ll either end up writing your own store for cdbi or you ll work out how to use the cdbi compatibility layer in dbix-class to get it working or if it s a new codebase then you should really consider cdbi legacy and building your schema with dbix-class and dbix-class schema loader

1097365
profiling	debugging
if you don t have sql profiling available you will need to downloading the source and use debugging to see the actual sql statement that it is trying to execute

1097421
solaris	unix
solaris unix apis are sometimes different than standards unix functions

1097429

setwindowshookex is invoked from 32-bit code to hook 32-bit process and from 64bit code to hook 64bit process

1097956
32-bit	64bit
the latter basically means that you have to create both 32-bit and 64bit executable that both call setwindowshookex providing 32-bit and 64bit dll respectively as an hmod parameter

1097956
32-bit	64bit
if you application is 32-bit you will have to spawn 64bit process that will call setwindowshookex and probably do nothing else until you unhook

how do i alias the insert and deleted virtual tables in a triggers in mssql 2005 .so that i can use another set of insert and deleted virtual tables from an output clause later in the triggers

1098247
children	nodes	children	tree
it has the tree nodes children collections parent prev next sibling etc

1098251
order	add
even though getfields and getmethods return results in no particular order you can add the elements in the returned arrays to collections and provide your own comparator to sort them however you want

1098255
synonym	term
each term in snomed typically has several synonym abbreviations and a preferred named

1098259
stderr	stdout
then you can use tricks to have that .com be a proxy for the stdin stdout stderr and launchd the same-named .exe file

1098264
attributes	properties
range excelworksheet.cell curtasknode.data_min_row + minrow curtasknode.data_min_col + mincol .locked is the properties to find a cell locked attributes

1098265
perl	ruby	perl	c++	python	ruby	python	c++	python	perl
in addition to what you can use on series 40 for third-party application development there are the options of using c++ python for s60 perl ruby etc

1098292
getter	setter
the best methods seems to be using a hibernate formula mapped to the getter and setter of my bcount attributes in the class a

1098302
revision	updates
using tortoisesvn the updates item to revision action within the repo browser can be used to locally reconstruct the repository s folder structure for an arbitrary repo path

1098302
revision	updates
right-click on desired folder choose updates item to revision

1098302
revision	updates
leave default of head revision and working copy updates depth click ok

1098302
directory	folder
this will updates your working copy with the contents of the chosen repo path including all the parent directory up to the start of the checkout working copy thus mirroring the folder hierarchy of the repository in your working copy

1098302
revision	updates
notes on the updates item to revision context menu option

1098316
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
im a ruby-on-rails developer that took on a php client last year and after researching available php frameworks i decided on cakephp because i felt it was the most ruby-on-rails-esque and stable

1098316
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
quite honestly i have never regretted my decision to start learning ruby-on-rails and im sure you will find the task even easier coming from a cakephp background

1098316
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
cakephp comes very very close to cloning the core ruby-on-rails way of doing things

1098318
contains	elements	contains	any
setting a dimension height width and overflow to auto or hidden on the parent elements causes it to contains any floated child elementss

1098321
selected	button
if you still can t selected the button then either the types don t match or perhaps the toolbar is just simulated..

1098343
data-structures	tree
it will teach you how to model tree data-structures in code

1098348
reflection	runtime
c and c++ don t have reflection .so none of this information can be recovered at runtime

1098357
name-lookup	linkage
for the part of the lookup using unqualified name-lookup 3.4.1 only function declarations with external linkage from the templates definition context are found

1098363
processor	cpu
i ve already mapped the bottleneck to cpu - but want to optimize the scripting s performance before taking a hit on processor costs

1098382
dictionary	arrays
granted you could probably expect some hit since the dictionary has to do additional hashing that a simple arrays would not

1098397
unsigned	short
53328 cannot be nicely stored in short use int instead as it allows you to store unsigned value up to 10 9

1098403
attributes	properties	design-time	designer
the browsable false will hide the properties at design-time and the designerserializationvisibility attributes will tell the designer to not write any code into your designer file

1098405
revision	ignore
now the latest and greatest revision is the one made by cc which is ignore as i told cc

1098427
buffering	streaming
rather than second-guess the os why don t you just use a regular buffering streaming and let the swap spaces be your file backing

1098431
unmanaged	c++-cli
i m developing an .app in c++-cli and have a csv file-writing libs in unmanaged code that i want to use from the managed portion

1098446
contains	any
however what i really need is to be able to selected a folder then every file contains in the selecteded folder to be listed at which the user could then remove any unwanted files before hitting upload.

1098454
contains	elements
instead of a max-min heap could you use two instances of a java.util.priorityqueue contains the same elements

1098461
python	perl
rather than brute force a solution i feel like there must be some elegant python perl regular expression trick to do this

1098461
dictionary	for-loop
still a python newbie .so i bet there s a better way to handle each dictionary key than another for-loop

1098479
restart	reload
how i can reload this properties because i wanna change a lot of properties wrote inside file without restart application

1098480
testng	junit
from junit 4.7 it s now possible to run tests in parallels without using testng

1098522
order	join
the idea is that first you perform your join to link the customers and order

1098556
default-value	arguments
however if you plan on using a particular arguments with a particular default-value why not use named argumentss in the first place

1098601
contains	elements
i have an order sequences like 1 3 5 6 8 9 i want to get first missing elements 2 in the example or max if sequences contains no missing elementss

1098616
dictionary	map
value in the dictionary you pass to translation as opposed to key which must be ordinals can be unicode ordinals arbitrary unicode strings or none to remove the corresponding character as part of the translation .so it s easy to specify ignore a certain character for .sorting purposes map ã to ae for .sorting purposes and the like

1098621
directory	folder
caveat if you want to keep these files which you appear to want you must manually remove the .git directory from the submodule folder

1098641
32-bit	64bit
one thing that s worth noting is that if you can t upgrade from a medium-cpu to high-cpu instances because the 32-bit os images won t run on larger instances and 64bit won t run on smaller instances

1098647
handler	service
assuming that theses call can t be made again while you re waiting you could just add a completed handler for each of the service

1098686
aggregate-functions	sum
the above doesn t work because you can t have the aggregate-functions sum in the where-clause

1098700
environment	building
maven has the concept of profiling for this kind of things building for different environment with maven 2

1098703
create-table	alter-table
i want to be able to use selected insert updates and delete create-table drop-table alter-table add column alter-table drop column and support for constraints primary key unique not null foreign key references

1098714
sql-server-express	sql-server
as far as handling 40-50 users there is really no practical difference in using sql-server-express than a full-blown versioning of sql-server for the size of your application from what you imply in your question

1098732
sql-server	firebird
i have looked at various in-memory or embedded-database engines sqlite hsql firebird but never came close to finding a good way to unit test sql-server code in memory generally due to the limitations of those engines no stored-procedures

1098733
getter	setter
then you have getter setter without the _ to give them public access

1098754
credentials	security
user s aren t .so savvy to just avoid all of these weak sites and often use the same credentials for weak security sites and strong security sites

1098759
python	java
this is something i have previously done in python but this web-app is intended to be strictly java technology for maintenance purposes

1098770
linux	unix
.so in web development mode on windows my programs wouldn t break .when migrate to a linux unix webhost and i could use a standards issue shebang line #

1098776
defined	declare
keep in mind that before the class is actually defined you can only declare pointers to it not instances

1098793
ssl-certificate	ssl
if everybody out there started to use ssl it would lose that second function points unless every person who ran a site purchased an ssl-certificate from a trusted authority and got verified...in which case everybody is going to have to pay a lot more for that site

1098797
any	set
that bit is working fine however i want to set the canexecute for these button .so that they are disabled if for any rea.son a report is not currently display in the viewer

1098805
python	perl
i d suggest a perl python scripting or any other scriptinging-language that takes 3 parameters

1098815
http	ssl
you can use an http to http proxy or an ssl proxy like stunnel in front of your java-server

1098819
environment	execution
i had to change the execution environment of the plugins in the manifest and the project jre to java 5 to have it show up on my mac

1098828
factors	primes
and as far as performance well it is a small hit but it s a hit that will keep rising as computer performance rises as computers get faster it gets easier to both decode rsa encryption using a key and to primes factors large numbers .so computer performance and key length need to rise together

1098834
default-value	arguments
indeed in python 3 you can even have keyword-only arguments that aren t optional ones without a default-value

1098855
any	set
a brute-force methods could be to include .some scripting at the very top of the scripting include to set the document object to undefined null .so that any references to its methodss will cause a runtime error

1098863
logging	trace
i mean without putting trace statements all over the code like here or adding error handler for logging to every procedure like here

1098869
silverlight	wpf
i ve been creating prism silverlight slant but most applies to wpf as well resources

1098875
haskell	scala
for other languages that like scala are flexible in the use of non-word function and methods named see smalltalk where like scala every operators is just another methods and haskell which allows the programmer to defined precedence and fixity of flexibly named functions

1098883
gethashcode	equals
if you are finding that the results are empty .when they shouldn t be you might want to checked to make sure your image class implements equals and gethashcode properly .so that they can be effectively compared

1098892
scala	java
note that this is plain java code most probably you can write the same in scala too

1098897
udp	mtu
given the minimum mtu on the internet is 576 and the size of the ipv4 header is 20 bytes and the udp header 8 bytes

1098898
export	csv
to make matters worse we can only export to the binary excel format since de csv export is broke and they refuse to fix it.

1098898
click	mouse
i guess i could hardcode mouse positioning click events and keystrokes with delay and everything.

1098913
struts-action	spring-mvc
your jsp is probably backed on the server side by a servlet or struts-action or spring-mvc controllers

1098933
cucumber	webrat
we re bdd tdd ing with rspec and cucumber which is using webrat for webpage testing

1098944
postgresql	mysql
if you are looking for in-memory dataset for the speed they provide you may want to look at in-memory table storages mysql and postgresql do it and others can be tricked into doing it by setting the table storage spaces on a ramdisk for instances

1098950
launchd	daemons
i ended up installing a tiny flash policy daemons and setting launchd to provide it inetd-style

1098951
environment	execution
it could be execution environment as fabian suggests

1098979
tuples	set
this sproc returns a set of fooid | fooname tuples

1098979
entity-framework	nhibernate
i m not sure if other orms such as nhibernate entity-framework or llblgen would be able to handle this or not

1098980
graph-databases	neo4j
you could try one of the java-based graph-databases such as neo4j

1098994
canvas	scale
my problem is the fill is not scale with the svg canvas .so proportionally it ends up as twice the size it was before the scale of the path

1099028
aes	rsa	aes	des	des	rsa
cryptography algorithm aes des rsa md5 ...

1099029
export	csv
1 export data from maxdb for each table as a csv

1099033
onclientclick	ispostback
ispostback and have enableviewstate for the grid to be true click the link in that column doesnt triggers the onclientclick event

1099040
put	get
if i move the code around and put the selected from the lead table i get the leads right bots 0 on all click

1099061
deep-copy	object	contains	any
if you are cloning object where the sub graphing contains things like db connections or file streaming handles you obviously have issues but that it true for any generalized deep-copy

1099073
double	int
unsigned will enable you to have a larger double the size int id column

1099089
32-bit	64bit
looking at the java docs it states that it classes a long as 64bit 8 bytes whereas other sources show a signed long-integer should be 32-bit - is there a way to get around this

1099118
nvidia	ati
there will also be offerings from nvidia ati intel etc

1099121
textbox	button
you could have a hidden textbox on the form from the first page that each button sets a value in before posting to the second page

1099124
python	java
there are a lot of python tools but i d like to stick with java since that s what the programmers are using

1099130
interpolation	splines
you can simply sample the finger location at set intervals and then interpolation the sample points using something like a catmull-rom splines

1099133
continuous-integration	build-server
the only place i see a build-server being useful is for continuous-integration with the build-server constantly building what is committed to the repository

1099145
environment	building
for consistent quality and to get the building off your machine to spot environment errors and .so that any files you forget to checked in to .source control al.so show up as building errors

1099147
implements	extends
there is an opportunity to implements the features in ddaviesbrackett s words that we want netbooks to have other than by extends a 1970 s time-sharing os

1099150
base-class	inherited
are you sure form as in inherited from asp.net-mvc s viewpage base-class

1099152
persistent	transient
fluency seems to me much more important .when your object are subject to persistent focused attention than .when they are transient and ancillary to the core logic

1099154
ref	out
first of all that should probably be out not ref

1099157
value	field
use the filtering on the column field and selected only yes value

1099168
ref	out
the second option would do what you intend but you might want to change it to use the out keyword instead of ref .so the callers of your methods will know the intention of what you re doing

1099174
configuration	environment	environment	building
it s necessary to have a clean environment free of artifacts of previous versioning and configuration changes inorder to ensure that building and tests work and don t depend on the artifacts

1099184
continuous-integration	build-server
a build-server is a distinct concept to a continuous-integration server

1099184
environment	building
by contrast a building-server exists to building the project typically a release against a tagged revision on a clean environment

1099187
ref	out
you can use out or ref parameters as you mentioned

1099192
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
however this seems to be causing my application issues as it can get called several time dealloc didreceivememorywarning and viewdidunload

1099202
show	next
after that is show the next line of code is execute which is the not ok messages

1099215
python	perl
.so equivalent to .net s balancing grouping or pcre regex in perl are not immediately possible in python

1099218
any	set	contains	any	contains	set
_logoview isn t set to nil automatically just by releasing it .so any future methods you try to call using that pointers will go to a memory location that used to contains a valid object but now containss junk

1099229
environment	building
our building machine has scripting that make the building distribute it to uat environment and even to production staging

1099249
32-bit	64bit
in c it s not uncommon that a a long is 32-bit on some platform and 64bit on others

1099262
environment	building
do building from the repository and in a clean environment

1099266
arrays	loops
and fill up the 2 dimension arrays row using a loops

1099267
environment	building
take load of developer machines provide a stable reproducible environment for building

1099289
relational-database	relational-algebra
the relational-database model has a firm mathematical basis in relational-algebra

1099290
any	set
i might be old fashioned but i just set up my .cabal file and darcs repository and add a makefile that with the dependencies of its default action tries to building my package runs any tests checked in the current building and fires off cabal haddock to generator my documentation

1099292
arrays	loops
if you are getting all the data as rows you of course don t need loops that puts arrayss in the arrays of arrayss as you would just replace them anyway

1099301
any	set
set up a timer on the client to checked every few seconds i know how to do this now but it would involve making and closing a new connection to the database hundreds of time an hour regardless of whether there was any change

1099305
python	ruby
python and ruby are usually considered to be close cousins though with quite different historical baggage with similar expressiveness and power

1099305
python	ruby
.so why would ruby be more suitable for such a framework than python

1099307
complement	negation
cdc used to produce 1 s complement machines which made negation very easy as you suggest

1099307
subtraction	complement
as i understand it it also allowed them to produce hardware for subtraction that didn t infringe on ibm s patent on the 2 s complement binary subtractor

1099309
twos-complement	addition
which brings us to twos-complement negation is easy and the addition of mixed positive and negative-number follows naturally with no additional hardware

1099312
packaging	building
this include updating the building tag creating any distribution packaging running automated-tests creating and distributing building report

1099320
python	ruby
some have said that the types of metaprogramming required to make activerecord a key component of ruby-on-rails possible is easier and more natural to do in ruby than in python - i do not know python yet

1099323
rollback	commit
.when the invocation finishes the transactionalinterceptor commit rollback the transactional

1099332
any	set
a set of attributes on an elements isomorphizes directly onto a named value map in which the value are text or any serialization value-type

1099333
where-clause	sql
had the back-end of the .app been an sql database the user could just types the body of the where-clause

1099339
python	ruby
i m not dissing ruby at all just standing up for python

1099341
moss	wss
this was fixed by upgrading to wss sp2 and moss 2007 sp2

1099356
upgrade	migrate
there used to be an utility called scptxfr.exe which was part of the standards sql-server 7.0 and 2000 install.its original purpose was as part of the upgrade process that allowed sql-server 6.5 databases to be migrate to sql-server 7.0 and 2000

1099364
value	field
this isn t the case - it only means that the value of the field which is a reference to the dictionary won t change and even then it can still change while inside constructor and can be null before it execute

1099367
python	ruby
it is in fact possible to do this sort of metaprogramming in python and other languages too but ruby has a leg up because metaprogramming isn t a special styles of programming

1099367
language-features	keyword
this is to large degree responsible for the degree of declarativeness possible in ruby-on-rails and the ease by which we are able to implements new declarative features that look like keyword or new block language-features

1099373
updating	updates
you are calling executenonquery which should be used for updating the database insert delete updates

1099384
attributes	properties
you can get the attributes of the pattern with document.getelementbyid raphael-pattern-0 and change its properties with the setattribute

1099388
hide	show
i am using the jquery methods for one of these sections to hide show the section if the use click an html link.

1099388
radio	click
i need to triggers the click of the html link inorder to make one of the radio button cause the panels to slider open or call the same methods that is handling the sliding

1099388
radio-button	selected
as a matter of fact i cannot even get an alert to pop-up .when the radio-button is selected

1099392
attributes	properties	getter	setter
within the quad class definition the scale attributes can be a properties with proper getter and setter functions

1099400
click	mouse
i see that the table supports determining which cell is click on but in this case i want the mouse events to propagate to the various widget inside the cell

1099416
put	get
you want to put the reference itself inside inorder to get at the whole arrays

1099430
shutdown	exit
iâ m thinking that .when selectvalueapp completes the exit it will cause a shutdown of the jvm and kill desktopapplicationview

1099454
python	ruby
.so i think we can conclude that ruby are not better and likely neither worse than python in this respect

1099469
value	field
not pertinant to your question but assuming that vw_tickets.isissue is a bit field or otherwise constrained to value of zero or one. the inline query can be removed to simplify launchy s answer

1099470
alignment	spacing
suggest optimal spacing alignment and

1099480
widget	button
you could probably start with something like that then programmatically send events to your button widget to make the appearance of click

1099482
contains	set
you should set the width of the td contains the words to a specific size using css

1099483
arguments	default
alternately if you only want normals menus in a very specific scenario for instances editing cmd in a textarea use the showcontextmenu arguments to identify this and only then return s_false to triggers the default

1099500
slidedown	slideup
i have it working except .when my mouse goes over the trail-text area that area bounce slidedown slideup repeatedly a numbers of time

1099501
instrumentation	profiling
instrumentation provides memory profiling tools allocated object leaks etc... and can connect to the iphone simulator or a remote device to .profile iphone apps

1099520
mouseover	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout
the problem is that the mouseover and mouseout events bubble upward which means they fire every time the mouseenter or leaves any elements within your div

1099529
put	get
rest is the idea of having resources addressed with a global identifier the uri in the case of http that are accessed in a crud way using .post get put and delete in the case of http .

1099529
json	xml
as most people you ll probably wind up with an rpc api be it based on xml or json or whatever that include a transport layer for a partially restful subsystem .

1099536
constructor	private	instances	private
have the class itself store a static pointers of its own types and the constructor be private .so one would be forced to use the static getter to get the one instances of the class

1099536
constructor	private
if it isn t a valid one then it would create one has access to the private constructor and store it in m_configinstance .so every subsequent call would access the same one

1099590
version-control	git
if you really can t use mercurial or git i d suggest looking at one of the other distribute version-control systemd

1099592
children	nodes
now that i ve realized that the top-level nodes does not make sense i want to remove it and promote its children

1099593
.when	ready
if the data is external such as on a socket or other input device then the handle can generally be set to allow waiting for data to become available - no need to poll in that case since the event will always be signaled .when data is ready for consumption

1099603
attributes	properties
i ve replace my custom properties attributes with fillers

1099616
hide	show
i have some divs that i am using jquery to hide and show using the toggle function

1099669
swing	awt
imho the main reason that they didn t catch on is that they required tended to required too much skill and used awt swing which produces worse uis than what a designer with little programming skills could achieve with flash

1099672
udp	tcp
since tcp guarantees packets delivery and thus can be considered reliable whereas udp doesn t guarantee anything and packetss can be lost

1099672
udp	tcp
what would be the advantage of transmitting data using udp in an application rather than over a tcp streaming

1099684
safari	opera
i tested this properly recently in a few non-javascript browsers and disabled javascript completely in fx safari and opera and got exactly the results i was hoping for

1099692
udp	tcp
that is why these types of applications use udp instead of tcp

1099695
udp	tcp
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

1099698
udp	tcp
you want to use udp over tcp in the cases where losing some of the data along the way will not completely ruin the data being transmitted

1099703
any	set
in your case it seems surprising to me that any button are display while using the bs_ownerdraw styles while bs_pushbutton is set

1099712
udp	tcp
since udp does not involve connection establishment there fore applications like dns where connection establishment delay needs to be avoided udp is preferred over tcp

1099718
udp	tcp
udp is also used in situations where the expense of creating a connection and syncing with tcp outweighs the payload

1099728
selected	cell
it will put text of a selected cell prompt in the active cell

1099730
contact	submit
i want to do basic functionality with a simple contact form and on submit the form email to someone

1099731
arrays	loops
i have a 2-dimensional jagged arrays though it s always rectangular which i initializer using the traditional loops

1099732
implements	super
not only is simple to implements it is super simple to implements 2s complement hardware that supports both signed and unsigned arithmetic since they are the same thing

1099734
udp	tcp
udp can be multicasted to multiple hosts whereas tcp cannot do this at all

1099737
hsqldb	oracle
i d be interested to see your experience with one of these product h2 derby hsqldb oracle berkeley-db

1099761
value	field
also you should know that certain field properties do not actually exist until they are assign a value of which the format properties is one of them

1099761
value	field
the code below first gets a reference to the field in question creates a new format properties with the desired value and then append it to the field definition

1099768
configuration	logging
the entlib logging application block doesn t allow for setting username passwd or usessl in the emailtracelistenerdata configuration types is there a common solution for this

1099771
constructor	object
to the variables test you have now construct a new object that inherited all the properties and methods from the gmap constructor class

1099787
firefox	safari
why would this ajax call work in safari but not firefox and how do i fix it for firefox

1099787
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.1 gecko 20090624 firefox 3.5

1099807
udp	tcp
a big thing that people forget is that udp is packets based and tcp is bytestream based there is no guarantee that the tcp packets you sent is the packets that show up on the other end it can be dissected into as many packetss as the router and stack desire

1099807
udp	tcp
.so the term udp packets makes sense but tcp packets doesnt necessarily

1099807
udp	tcp
tcp has its own re-try and order mechanism that is hidden from your application you can re-invent that with udp to tailor it to your needs

1099859
backslash	regex
it seems that passing the windows file separator to a function that is building a regex from it is a bad idea because the backslash being an escape character

1099870
udp	tcp
there are other cases where udp is preferable to tcp

1099870
udp	tcp
