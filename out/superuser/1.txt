macbook	bootcamp
my late 2008 macbook pro unibody machine has a number of ugly flaws that rear their head under windows bootcamp

70
kde	gnome
if you are indeed using linux take a look at evince for gnome or okular for kde

114
kde	gnome
it sounds like this problem has something to do with the gnome power manager so my best bet is to either install some other power manager if that s possible or try to use kde as window manager instead

122
firefox	safari
is there any plugin or extension so i can view any pdf directly within firefox 3.5 on windows just like with safari on a mac

150
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
default window manager gnome kde xfce

195
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
if they are debian based the most likely use the dpkg apt deb system if its a red hat system it most likely uses yum rpm

195
kde	gnome
most major distro s choose between kde and gnome with gnome seeming to be the popular one at the moment

195
centos	mint	centos	linux	debian	linux	debian	centos	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
i highly recommend linux mint for home systems and vanilla debian ubuntu server edition or centos for servers

218
macbook	bootcamp
the bottom of my macbook becomes extremely hot when i use bootcamp apple s built-in solution for running windows on a mac especially when i play games

228
kde	gnome
see the title - are there any show-stopping differences between gnome and kde at this point

237
folder	directory
move each size folder to the external directory renaming it to the name of its parent the specific directory name

241
tunnel	vpn
the easiest simplest solution is to use a vpn or ssl tunnel to encrypt traffic going over wifi regardless of wep wpa

319
kde	gnome
and i should note â gnome and kde are desktop environments not window managers

319
kde	gnome
i switch quite frequently. in all honesty i currently use kde because i feels that its file browser and text editor dolphin and kwrite are more powerful than their gnome counterparts nautilus and gedit

319
kde	gnome
so my answer is no gnome and kde are not worlds apart in terms of functionality

319
kde	gnome
two years ago i would have said gnome prefers simplicity while kde prefers customizability

319
kde	gnome
kde is now a little flashier than gnome but beyond that they re essentially the same

328
mouse	keyboard
see system preferences - keyboard and mouse - keyboard shortcuts to see what the keys are on your system for move focus to next window in active application

339
kde	gnome
well i think one of the main things that differentiates kde and gnome in particular is that gnome is aimed at making things easy and straightforward at least from their point of view i say this because there have been many arguments amongst the developers from both camps as to what is easy and straightforward

339
kde	gnome
what s interesting is that if you re in any way comfortable with computers it might end up being that kde with its more options would seem easier for you since you have more possibilities in terms of customizing things to your liking whereas on gnome you might be wondering where or how you do a certain thing

388
opera	google-chrome	switching	screens
i am thinking about switching my web browser to google-chrome on my asus eee because it has better screens usage but i really do like a lot of the handy things opera provide

444
opera	google-chrome
i used opera extensively before switching to google-chrome on my laptop because it s hard to perform gestures

454
versioning	upgrade
without knowing your sound card it s hard to say where to find such an upgrade but what versioning of debian are you running

458
opensolaris	openbsd	debian	centos	freebsd	debian	freebsd	centos	freebsd	opensolaris	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	openbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	debian	openbsd	centos
i use vmware server 2.0 for my software testing environment where i run virtual machines of ubuntu debian suse centos fedora opensolaris freebsd openbsd windows xp vista 7 concurrently

460
sudo	passwd
sudo will ask you your passwd and you need to be cleared for sudo access to do that

645
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i normally use opera and fall back to firefox then to ie if i need extra compatibility not very often - would safari add anything to that

653
google-chrome	safari
i would use google-chrome though as it shares a large part of its codebase including webkit with safari but it is more suitable for windows

659
firefox	safari
safari will not provide any compatibility gains next to firefox or ie

681
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu these days works quite well with most hardware

688
switching	screens
a friend of mine told me that its pc suffer strange behavior sometimes doesn t reach the windows welcome screens or it switching off suddenly during it working or produce weird graphics on its monitor

738
vmware	virtualbox
vmware however has ability of managing virtual machines by network firefox while virtualbox you can manage only from machine it is running on

774
opera	firefox
opera is a solid choice though its default skin is worse than firefox

814
parallels	bootcamp
since then the bootcamp beta expired and i used parallels to run the xp in a vm from that partition

824
ubuntu	opensuse
i d recommend ubuntu kubuntu fedora core or opensuse in that order

824
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu and opensuse work best with kde which is a bit flashier

866
folder	directory
this works nicely for individual files but not for folder directory

903
mouse	keyboard
i ve got a mac mini as my home entertainment machine and i m currently using a regular wireless keyboard and mouse combo

911
versioning	upgrade
you can run it with 2gb but you d probably want the 32bit versioning then which stinks if you later decide to upgrade memory to 4gb as you d then need to reinstall everything

915
installation	upgrade
i guess the problem was the upgrade from existing xp installation

946
installation	upgrade
i seem to recall that on xp if you installed plain xp upgrade to a service pack then went into the setup program for xp and enabled iis it copied files from the original xp cd location which meant you probably had to reapply the service pack afterwards to secure the new iis installation

952
macbook	bootcamp
i m running bootcamp on a macbook pro and it gets pretty hot to the extent that the cpu starts throttling down

965

1034
macbook	bootcamp
i have a macbook pro and installed on this is windows via bootcamp

1054
mouse	keyboard
usb keyboard mouse

1062
virtualbox	parallels
i d install a 64-bit version and potentially something like virtualbox so i can run a 32-bit version in parallels in case i d need some software that is only available in 32-bit

1137
put	get
i put them all in a programs dir on a drive separate from my windows partition so whenever i reinstall i have all my applications available with minimal effort and on the plus side i get a nice clean setup

1144
mouse	keyboard
you should use only keyboard shortcuts for that configuration since mouse movements alone seems not supported for that special side that crosses over to the other monitor

1185
rss	feed
i use outlook 2007 at home as an imap client and rss feed reader

1254
mouse	keyboard
on mac you can reassign the caps lock key under system prefs - keyboard mouse - special keys

1264
gentoo	linux
what are the minimum system requirements to be able to run gentoo linux effectively

1298
versioning	upgrade
if i install windows 7 rc will i be able to upgrade it to a non-time bombed versioning

1315
google-chrome	firefox
there is an inspector built into webkit and thus google-chrome already which does many of the same things as firebug on firefox

1324
versioning	upgrade
users running an activated versioning of windows 7 release candidate will not have to reinstall an older versioning of windows before using a windows 7 upgrade disk. unfortunately those who choose this path will see all of their files and such ushered into a folder labeled windows.old when the final versioning of win7 is installed

1358
centos	linux
how to install gnome desktop on linux centos .i would appreciate detailed steps as i am a linux newbie

1365
client-side	server-side
as others have said the big difference is server-side versus client-side storage

1374
ubuntu	linux
the operating system is ubuntu linux and most of the cpu time isn t taken up by super_script.rb but by other ruby programs it calls via system

1384
fullscreen	minimized
many applications and a great number of games work in fullscreen mode and if you press this key accidentally most of times because you wanted to press the ctrl or alt keys the application usually freezes for a while and minimized itself

1405
fullscreen	minimized
it s a sacrifice but it means that i don t minimized anything fullscreen by accident

1459
mouse	keyboard
in system preferences under keyboard mouse you can opt to use the top row as standard function keys accessing their special functions by holding fn

1627
youtube	vimeo
when blocking both the sys and #sharedobjects folders youtube and vimeo work fine though they might not remember any settings

1660
ubuntu	linux
i m new in the linux world and i installed ubuntu 9.04 on a new virtual machine

1674
switching	screens
using multiple tabs in screens does not work fine for my case as i need to look at multiple xterms at once - not switching between the tabs

1674
xfce	gnome
fvwm xfce gnome would be good but other wms having this facility are welcome too

1699
google-chrome	firefox

however this means i still have to pull out the mac s keyboard and mouse in order to log in

1802
daemons	launchd
i tried making a user daemons so that it would launchd on boot but i get the following errors in the console

1834
ubuntu	linux
if you do not have something like this i would try the normal linux ubuntu driver for your graphic card

1890
sniffing	ssid
disabling ssid broadcast is also not really useful as that is also easily derivable by sniffing the wireless traffic

1895
ubuntu	linux
arch linux provides a 64-bit build ubuntu does et cetera

2008
installation	upgrade

2108
debian	linux
i created a usb drive linux for a team of robots - i used debian which was selected because it was very easy to put it in a small space and i am familiar with it already

2130
mouse	keyboard
lay your keyboard and mouse out where you can get and use them without reaching or stretching

2130
mouse	keyboard
get a keyboard and mouse you are comfortable with -- i m not a fan of ergonomic keyboards but if you like them and can use them great

2251
vmware	virtualbox
your best bet is to use a virtual machine that has a better video device vmware virtualbox etc

2305
switching	screens
allows me to use the mouse to push on the edge of the screens to switching to the next desktop and easily set up multiple tasks so i don t have to clutter my work area with a lot of unrelated windows when i m working on multiple things at once

2399
put	get
get some heak sink paste and removing the fan cleaning any old paste off and applying a thin layer of new paste put everything back together 1-2

i just upgrade my divx to versioning 7

2404

2417
rss	feed
if you re 3rd party software has an rss feed on their web site you can subscribe to their feed with a rss reader i use google s

2419
cpu	processors
each core on these processors has a digital thermal sensor dts that reports temperature data relative to tjmax which is the safe maximum operating core temperature for the cpu

2485
versioning	upgrade
i would even accept the fact that it is a hardware limitation but i just don t understand why they don t sell an upgrade versioning that supports 64-bit

2549
ubuntu	linux
lots of people recommend ubuntu but i find it a little too kiddy linux

2566
vpn	lan
it creates a vpn and allows local access to pc s even if they re not on the lan

2964
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups has a presentation mode however this mode is not exportable into a standalone format

3045
ffmpeg	handbrake
however you can get handbrake for most platforms to rip the content from the dvd and then use ffmpeg or a gui front end for ffmpeg to extract just the audio

3063
ati	nvidia
installing or upgrading nvidia or ati graphics drivers tend to sometimes make a real mess unless properly uninstalled first

3150
mouse	keyboard
it also had a separate keyboard and mouse because the only part you could get to was the screen

3189
punctuation	words
use a longish pass phrase - doesn t have to be random a good set of words using mixed case and some punctuation will do pretty much as well and will be easier to remember and to enter into devices various

3221
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
in order of preference totally in my opinion vmware fusion parallels desktop for mac and virtualbox

3224
google-chrome	firefox
sometimes it s seemed as if flash is unhappy with it possibly as if it causes flash to blow out google-chrome s memory usage which might relate to the having firefox open part of things

3275
firefox	safari
it shouldn t be - the rest of the applications on this machine are really fast and safari starts instantly - but i love firefox and don t want to leave it

3434
post	get
if anyone knows where to get it please post in the comments

3441
vim	emacs
move to either an editor you already use and are comfortable with emacs with the auctex extensions or vim gvim with the latexsuite extensions or a cross-platform editor such as texworks

3465
antivirus	norton
it doesn t seem like the average antivirus or antispyware programs do anything for it adaware norton avg

3732
virtualbox	parallels
but if i ve got a virtualbox or parallels session going the cpu load goes up to a very steady 25 and then it gets hot

3736
freebsd	linux
apparently freebsd has prs and linux has public relations

3754
firefox	safari
that way i can keep one browser safari very lean and fast for regular browsing and another can be fully loaded with all kinds of plug-ins for sites that require them firefox

3768
put	get
to get any decent frame rate i have to put all the setting to low but even then i get weird graphical gliches when i play

3815
firefox	safari
you could have safari for speed browsing and load firefox with everything you want

4082
google-chrome	firefox
have tried ie firefox google-chrome

4082
antivirus	norton
i suspect its something to do with my norton antivirus but skype is working fine

4156
mouse	keyboard
i have been meaning to try and use the keyboard more as my sole means of navigating windows but i am having trouble sticking with it because when i need to do something and i cannot find the right shortcut i grab the mouse and forget to let go of it again

4209
macbook	bootcamp
i have windows 7 running on my macbook and i am wondering if it is possible to take advantage of the multi touch trackpad and have more gestures more than the default bootcamp drivers give you

4219
mouse	keyboard
but you can easily fix this by going to system preferences keyboard mouse keyboard modifier keys

4270
wan	lan
if you need this to work over a wan connection you will also need to open port 3389 on your firewall and point it to the lan address of the windows 7 machine

4292
hide	show
no more going into the stupid customize dialog to get show hide a tray icon

4310
ethernet	wireless
ethernet not wireless

4310
ethernet	wireless
i m avoiding that with the ethernet to wireless bridge

open path to dir will launch the folder in finder

4384
ubuntu	opensuse
you want to use a reliable and well supported distribution such as ubuntu and opensuse or edubuntu as suggested by charlls

4525
put	get
does microsoft put them anywhere we can get at them or are they just completely hidden

4544
kde	gnome
true it is a kde application which means you ll need some additional libraries instaleld if you re using gnome as your window manager but amarok is the best music player i have used on windows linux and os x

4605
wan	lan
| modem | ----| wan | | lan |----- | winxp-1 | -------------

4919
unix	solaris	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	linux
i learned generic unix stuff on linux and nextstep but i m now mainly an os x person after also going through solaris and openbsd

4937
ubuntu	linux
it is also a great system to run on laptops soemthing which is generally a pain with free oses some fare slightly better like ubuntu but i m not a linux user

5014
unix	bsd
if the goal is to learn unix then something like linux or bsd makes far more sense than os x

5014
fink	macports
i don t think of a userland where the accepted practice is to just leave it the hell alone and build your own packages somewhere else as fink and macports do

5030
vmware	virtualbox
i went from vmware to virtualbox and love the speed difference

5030
vmware	virtualbox
another thing great about vb is that the free vmware does not support shared folders but virtualbox does

5085
ubuntu	linux
and with vmware you have the option of visiting a ubuntu desktop to change settings the linux way while otherwise using ubuntu from the mac desktop using ssh and x11

5107

spyware	antivirus
on the other hand there s no more messing with firewall allow and deny lists no more messing with spyware or antivirus tools and no more defragmentation unless you really have nothing better to do

5164
freebsd	linux
7zip is an open source compression tool that works on linux freebsd mac os x beos dos amiga and windows

you can get your favorite browser opera firefox skype works fine other instant messengers too

5258
screens	tablet
the majority of touch features on windows 7 is aimed at touch screens notebooks and tablet as well as the touch panel lcd interfaces

5280
ubuntu	linux
if you run linux as desktop and you say you re new to it you re probably running something like ubuntu or similar

5280
sudo	passwd
on console you can get root access by using su command if you know root s passwd or sudo su if your distro uses sudo

5287
mp4	h.264
i m looking into developing our video content platform and part of it includes a better way for our users to upload their video content anything from dvds flash video dxid wmv etc.. and have it automatically converted at the moment to mp4 h.264 so that they can use it on the site though our cms

5299
versioning	upgrade
i don t work for acronis and have nothing to do with them apart from being a customer who is generally pleased with acronis trueimage i still use versioning 8 and have no reason to upgrade

5303
folder	directory
also the matters. so my shell looks for commands in the bin directory in my home folder then in usr local bin then in usr bin etc

5407
versioning	upgrade
however i have not tested if that works across a versioning upgrade

5509
indesign	framemaker
you can certainly do this in indesign too but with framemaker it s a lot easier

5549
spyware	antivirus
microsoft office antivirus software spyware malware adware removal tools

5563
ubuntu	linux
i just acquired a spare pc with a 40gb hard drive which i m planning to use for learning how to use linux on either ubuntu or mandriva

5570
ubuntu	linux
linux comes with drivers and i m guessing ubuntu provides firmware in addition to those and for the most part it shouldn t be missing any but it can happen

5581
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
just download an ubuntu cd and try it other distros that might be okay include fedora suse mandriva and linux mint

5602
ubuntu	linux
i ve used many many linux distributions and i would highly recommend ubuntu as a great distribution to learn with

5634
google-chrome	firefox
i have the flash 10 debug player installed and it works fine with google-chrome and firefox

5652
versioning	upgrade
i threw out the vendor crapware they give you to access it a trial versioning of mionet after it starting nagging me to upgrade and set it up as a standard network drive using window s map network drive

5698
ubuntu	linux
these days ubuntu is definatly the way to go for starting with linux it has the best support community for new users and some of the best hardware support ubuntu aren t too fussy about including stuff that other distros wouldn t consider free enough

5698
xfce	gnome
you don t mention how much ram you have but the machine doesn t sound that powerful so i d consider going with xubuntu - this has all the same stuff as ubuntu but uses the xfce desktop instead of gnome which is a little less resource heavy

5698
ati	nvidia
good graphics support for new cards recent nvidia ati

5741
disk	ram
maybe if you put more ram into the computer it will perform better because the disk cache can contain more data

5741
boost	allocator
ext4 and xfs for example might give you a boost because of their delayed allocator

5794
freebsd	linux
freebsd s ports system is great at this and there are many other alternatives out there for linux and other nix-based systems

5797
gentoo	linux
people will probably strongly disagree but i think gentoo is one of the best distributions for learning linux

5849
gentoo	linux
gentoo prefix is a chrooted installation of gentoo a source based linux distribution

5865
ubuntu	linux
this may not suit you but for folks who are nervous about trying ubuntu linux wubi lets you install it as though it were a windows program and tell it how much space it s allowed to use

5886
rar	zip
the tests i did sometime ago showed me that rar compress better some kilobytes no more but not enough to use a non-free program when zip works on almost all computers for free

5886
rar	zip
why do some people use rar rather than zip for compressing

5891
debian	linux
i m using it under debian gnu linux right now

5896
rar	zip
rar usually compresses much better than zip

5896
rar	zip
of course it depends heavily on the data but most of the time fast rar is similar to zip normal and rar best is much better

5901
rar	zip
but if i m seeking interoperability with other people who might not know about rar i use zip of course

5904
rar	zip
rar files don t have the limits that zip files do

5906
rar	zip
aside from this i don t know of any real advantages of rar of zip

5916
rar	zip
as current versions of winrar can decompress 7z and 7z can decompress rar and 7z usually compresses better than zip and often better than rar i tend to send those who send me rar files 7z files back

5975
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have three different browsers i want to compare mozilla firefox google-chrome and safari

5982
ethernet	wireless
it is always slower to connect to a local area network by wireless rather than by ethernet wired

6116
mp3	ogg
i have not checked specifically with wma or ogg files as most of my music is mp3

6189
ubuntu	linux
i don t want to install linux on my personal desktop but it seems that ubuntu requires me to that to in order to copy some specific files i need to create the usb livecd

6190

run damn small linux inside your existing linux install on ubuntu

6191
textmate	gedit

6236
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
is it possible to either port or directly use the vmware virtual machines with other systems such as parallels or virtualbox

6240
google-chrome	firefox
so i want to be able to use both firefox and google-chrome and i want to for example keep my bookmarks in sync

6252
google-chrome	firefox
since google-chrome doesn t have the addon ability of firefox you have to make do with online solutions

6252
google-chrome	firefox
bookmarks delicious or xmarks - neither of these have the nice integration with google-chrome that they do with firefox but you will be able to access your bookmarks from either browser

6275
vmware	virtualbox
this article explains how to convert vmware vmdks to virtualbox vdis

6294
mouse	keyboard
click use the computer without a mouse or keyboard

6338
ubuntu	debian
it was suggested that fedora and ubuntu debian are different enough to warrant different answers.

folder	dir
so taking a look at the contents of that folder with explorer far dir get-childitem whatever

6438
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i explain how to do all that in two posts at my blog cleaning up a debian gnu linux and cleaning up a debian gnu linux or ubuntu reprise

6498
mouse	keyboard
is there a decent desktop keyboard that has a mouse scroll ball in it

6498
mouse	keyboard
i find it extremely annoying moving from the keyboard to the mouse and back and my current mouse is giving me rsi

6565
mouse	keyboard
i would be curious if your battery may be causing some form of interference with the electrical signals that are generated by the keyboard mouse

6706
pop-up	dialog
since the image is read only if you try and save over it the save as dialog will pop-up instead

6722
versioning	upgrade
as chris thompson indicated you need to make sure it is not an upgrade edition but a full install versioning

6764
width	height
let s say we have many video files encoded with different configurations and has different properties audio and video bitrates frames sec frame width and height etc .

6766
punctuation	words
write a sentence and use the first letter of each words and any punctuation used

6785
ubuntu	debian
leopard requires this but its not enabled on debian ubuntu by default

6799
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs
if we look at when microsoft introduced nt for the first time it supported as much hardware and filesystems as possible and it continues to support both hfs ntfs and fat32 out of the box

6799
hfs+	ntfs
so if google wants to build bridges to the chromeos they should support hfs+ ntfs fat32 and ext3 that way it will ease transition and compatibility with other operating systems and maximise their chances of commercial success

6842
mouse	keyboard
as a rule of thumb it s definitely better to get powered usb hubs for any hard disk usage or heavy data access bigger thumb drives etc while self computer powered hubs are usually for mouse keyboard and generally device inputs

signing is mainly because rsa lets you use larger hashes than dsa

13169

x86	64bit	cpu	processors	16-bit	64bit
on an x86 cpu running in 64bit mode it is expensive read slow to change the mode of the processors to allow 16-bit programs to execute properly

15633
16-bit	64bit
it s so bad that microsoft didn t put in any infrastructure into any 64bit versions of windows to support 16-bit code

15633
16-bit	64bit
xp mode runs a virtual 32-bit windows xp instance and the virtualiation environmnet handles the 16-bit 64bit transition

15633
16-bit	64bit
in effect xp mode is the 16-bit support infrastructure that microsoft never put into prior versions of 64bit windows with the added bonus of having a full windows xp 32-bit environment to suppot problem software that doesn t want to run in windows 7

15633
16-bit	64bit
unless you ve got software that uses either 32-bit kernel-mode drivers or the aforementioned 16-bit code on 64bit windows you ll very likely never have need for xp mode

16300
disk	ram
linux can operate quite happily with no swap if you have enough ram for everything you ask it to do though it is still a good idea to have some swap as it can sometimes gain better performance when close to filling memory by pushing some not-recently-used stuff out to disk freeing up ram to use as cache buffer for currently active io operations

16300
disk	ram
hibernation on laptops netbooks may complicate things a little as iirc linux stores memory state in the swap space so you definitely need more then your ram size as swap if you plan to use hibernation and i don t know if that needs to be partition volume based swap or if file based can be used - it will certainly need to be something mentioned in fstab that can be seen very early in the boot process whic the inital ram disk is in use and your real root not yet mounted

19119
onenote	ms-office

19178
versioning	upgrade
not sure how the e versioning will play a role but i suspect it will not work as it is not a product you can upgrade to

19188
ethernet	wireless
lower end wireless routers generally would require a direct ethernet cable between devices for it to work properly

19203

try installing the linux backports modules for your version of ubuntu

19240
folder	directory
find the sources directory in the temp folder and open the file cversion.ini in your favorite text editor

19266
gentoo	ubuntu
i think you could create a gentoo partition mount it somewhere in the filesystem so you can access it while running ubuntu then chroot to it and do the compiling in the chrooted environment

19266
gentoo	linux
in fact you don t even need the gentoo installation disc at all since you already have a working linux environment

19266

check to see if echo does the right thing with od octal dump od -tx1 for hex od -to1 for octal

19363
disk	ram
it s not really any single app using so much ram but the fact that you can run so many application simultaneously without paging the disk like crazy

19365
disk	ram
admittedly these applications also will benefit from higher disk throughput but ram will also help immensely

19370
disk	ram
visual studio then and now with ram disk

19373
disk	ram
huge amounts of ram are most useful on servers -- the more ram you have the more cache you have and the less often you have to hit disk

19435
chown	chmod
it sounds like you ll need to take ownership of the files with chown and possibly set permissions on the file s to 777 with chmod

19443
mouse	keyboard
while the keyboard is fine the mouse holds extremely weird behavior

19446
mouse	trackpad

mouse	trackpad
i ve seen similar issues with a wired mouse - it just started misbehaving in very odd ways but using another mouse or the trackpad on the laptop was fine

19456

the exact details evade me at the moment but i think that under leopard you can only address 4 gb of physical memory â i believe the 64-bit memory space spills over to virtual memory on disk just like when 32-bit processes exceed the amount of installed ram

19493

darwin is like linux freebsd etc.

19493

19549
filesystems	ntfs
but of course that change also requires admin privileges and the ntfs filesystems

19590
post	get
however i have found that a good first step is to re-install the software update for web folders i would link but new users only get one hyperlink per post

19595
mouse	keyboard
you could also just use the kvm to switch monitors and not plug in the keyboard mouse

19603
kde	gnome
i m not done with it yet but if i decide i want to go back to my tried and true favorite gnome setup how do i go about removing the kde stuff easily without having to track down all the components in synaptic

19637
opera	firefox
check how firefox compares with some other browsers opera ie etc

19709

lvm	umount
the lvm never stops correctly it s tricky to get the exact wording because the filesystems have already umount by this point but it s along the lines of unable to stop volume group main device or resource busy

linux mint is ubuntu-based which in turn is based on debian and i ve seen two basic ways to do this in debian

20236
google-chrome	safari
one reason why i prefer safari over google-chrome in windows is because it syncs my bookmarks over mobileme

20349
folder	directory
create a folder called network shares or somewhere in your user directory or possibly in a shared directory

20370
switching	screens
i just found that google quick search box which i use instead of quicksilver has a command lock screens that invokes the login window like with quick user switching enabled

20374
google-chrome	safari
also download google-chrome or safari and use these their integration to windows is far less extensive than ie s and so they present a smaller attack footprint albeit with less functionality

20395
tunnel	vpn
as i have an rodc at their place for login caches and simple file replication i use the existing ipsec vpn tunnel to their network and then either remote desktop or remote assistance when applicable to help them interactively

i do have a corrupt and unreadable c ubuntu disks directory so that appears to be the correct path to the linux partition

avoid adapters that are not pci like usb bluetooth if you want good performance

20976
mouse	keyboard
also selecting most menu commands trying to open files by selecting the file and clicking the open button with my mouse will not work or will attempting to open the image menu with my keyboard it just moves me to the next menu when attempting to navgiate in it

synergy only shares your keyboard and mouse and clipboard between the 2 computers

21020
ubuntu	linux
now to hibernate my linux ubuntu jaunty required swap

21025
ubuntu	linux
on an ubuntu linux workstation i get something like the quoted text

21034
disk	ram
the kernel does this to save time in the next busy period - if the data is already copied there it can just release the ram it is using instead of having to do disk writes first

21034
next	except
so unless you know the machine is not going to need to swap again in the near future forcing the freeing of swap space may achieve nothing except to slow things down a little more next time swapping is needed

mouse	keyboard
works with a keyboard and mouse

in my router config i set up a virtual server to forward tcp and udp from public port 80 to my local machine on port 22

21380
mouse	keyboard
under windows there is an api call that returns simple data on keyboard mouse activity

21380

21421
redhat	fedora
the linux pocket guide is tailored to fedora linux--the latest spin-off of redhat linux--but most of the information applies to any linux system

21452
cvs	svn
but your classic cvs svn system has the obvious drawback of needing a full repository to work and i d really rather not have two copies of my 60gb+ mp3 folder sitting on a machine somewhere as well as not traditionally dealing with binary deltas very well

21452
bazaar	git
mercurial git and bazaar all look good on paper but i don t have any experience with any of them

21458
ubuntu	linux
i have a workstation running windows server 2008 that s logged into an ad domain and i have a dual boot with ubuntu linux

21478
cvs	svn
but your classic cvs svn system has

21478
cvs	svn
with cvs svn you have one repository and several working copies

21480
cvs	svn
but if you re set on it then svn at least does binary diff s cvs does full copies much larger

21526
pull	push
ok well i ended up breaking the push pins but standard tweezers can be used to pull the black tabs that are holding the black part of the push pin to the white part

21529
hfs+	ntfs
the first partition as fat32 ntfs use the ntfs-3g driver and the second partition as hfs+ for use with time machine

21529
hfs+	ntfs
though at least if you chose ntfs you could keep a copy of the driver on the hfs+ partition so you could use it with any mac

21531
ati	nvidia
-- also nvidia and ati made some serious rubbish cards a few generations ago that ate a huge chunk of your system ram and had hardly any performance increase

21550
ati	nvidia
nvidia not ati it wouldn t run at more than 640x480 4bit color when installed simultaneously with the his card

21595
filesystems	ntfs
the linux kernel is able to read ntfs filesystems as well as write but they consider that dangerous. mac os x has the ability to read ntfs but not write

vmware	virtualbox
you can also use vmware which is not free and sun s virtualbox which is free

21806
vim	emacs
so ideally what i d like is to look at apart from basics are the gaps that emacs can fill or things that it can just do better than vim

21806
vim	emacs	lisp	scheme
i suppose the canonical example is lisp scheme coding in emacs versus vim

21806
vim	emacs
where would you start tinkering with emacs to really appreciate its power and to get a good idea of how its approach to editing differs from vim and how the editors can complement each other

21825
kde	gnome
i can t quite tell but i assume you want the guest host to not have a gui gnome kde etc so just download whatever distro i like ubuntu and install their server version which doesn t have a gui

i ve got tens of thousands of product images that i need to resize constraining proportions so that the largest dimension height or width is 500 pixels

what are the advantages disadvantages of using cooperative linux like portable ubuntu for example compared to a qemu or any other virtual machine installation

22148
firefox	safari
the mac will be used primarily for web development that is it will need to run coda photoshop possible firefox and safari at the same time

22148
mouse	keyboard
i already have a keyboard mouse and 24 monitor

22156
mouse	keyboard
there s not much difference between a mac mini and an imac except for form factor so definitely yes given the fact that you already own a keyboard mouse and monitor get yourself a mac mini

22183
mouse	keyboard
you could then connect one screen with your regular kvm where also your keyboard and mouse is attached

22183
switching	screens
and attach your second screens to the vga or dvi switching

22214
mouse	keyboard
each computer has a keyboard mouse and two screens and is connected to the company s network

22216

you can cut and paste text from one machine to the other without leaving your main keyboard mouse

22217

mouse and keyboard between multiple

22217
mouse	keyboard
redirecting the mouse and keyboard is

22218
mouse	keyboard
however if you do need to run the other machines with monitors for some reason then you could use synergy to share one keyboard mouse between multiple machines

22218
mouse	keyboard
synergy allows you to just move the mouse off the edge of one machine and have it appear on the next redirecting the mouse keyboard to the second machine

22232
mouse	keyboard
i ve ended up using two hp lp2065 monitors that have two dvi inputs and an old belkin ps 2 kvm switch for the keyboard and mouse

22232
mouse	keyboard
the system still loses track of the keyboard and mouse occasionally

22232
mouse	keyboard
one point to note is that usb handles keyboards and mice being unplugged and plugged back in much better than ps 2 does - i use a usb keyboard and mouse to rescue windows machines if the kvm switch loses the plot

22237
firefox	safari
i recently switched from firefox 3.5 to safari 4 with glims

22250
versioning	upgrade
i should add that i upgrade it to 4gb so i can t judge the performance of the basic versioning

22315
firefox	safari
i use one as my main web development machine at work usually simultaneously running safari firefox textmate sequel pro and versions plus non-development stuff like tweetie and adium

22322
norton	mcafee
well i would shy away from norton - in my experience this just grinds the pc to a halt mcafee isn t much better either

22374

chances of accidental deletion of a folder are high when they are in your home directory

22457
switching	screens
set to full screens and switching back to your host os

22482

22649
hash	salt
if only a password is used no key file the password plus a 128-bit random salt are hash using sha-256 to form the final key but note there is some preprocessing protection against dictionary attacks

22649
hash	salt
the random salt prevents attacks that are based on pre-computed hash

22700
ubuntu	linux
even if you want to run windows and not linux you could boot from a live linux cd knoppix used to be the best-known such but the ubuntu install cd works too and see if any of the tweaks fixes the whine

22704
put	get
do you know of any firefox extension which could put the browser itself in a blocked state not accepting input from the user for a certain amount of time configurable by a timer and then get back to normal behaviour

22749
unix	bsd
since the apple os-x operating system is a unix derivative bsd and the underlying intel mac architecture is the same why isn t it very straightforward to get apple-specific applications running on linux

22787
mp3	wav
i d also prefer something that supports mp3 but wav support will also do

ubuntu	centos
i ve gotten them to work with virtual pc before ubuntu centos and mandrake but man it s a headache

22931
vmware	virtualbox
vmware workstation is probably a better product and virtualbox is free and runs on any host and with any guest so i ve had no need for virtual pc

22932
versioning	upgrade
microsoft must keep windows compatible with previous versioning otherwise current users will not upgrade

22938
mp3	m3u
this particular app supports aac+ mp3 pls m3u streams so it will play icecast shoutcast streams

22938
ubuntu	linux
something to watch out for if you re on linux and thinking of a similar setup the mpd server included in the ubuntu repository does not do mp3 streams due to licensing issues

23010
ubuntu	debian
as far as i know distros like debian ubuntu fedora usually modify the vanilla source code before creating a package

23013
ubuntu	debian
sometimes the .diff.gz file is missing this means that package is built only for debian ubuntu to handle some very-specific distro work.

23017
cifs	smb
i m having an issue with a networked drive i don t have root access to - i can make an smb connection to it it s a cifs system and it s used by the intranet to share files it s definitely functional as other people are using it

when that is a problem you need to use the post method post requests should never be cached instead of get or add an ever-changing value to the query string such as the current time in ms

23156
ubuntu	linux
is there a command line tool for ubuntu linux to do this

23157

mouse	keyboard
turns out in my bios i have it set to wake on keyboard mouse activity

23242
kde	gnome
i ve noticed a number of graphical glitches in it and am wondering how many of those glitches may be due to running a kde app in a gnome environment

23242
kde	gnome
are there any implications to running a kde app in a gnome environment or vice-versa

23259
google-chrome	safari
for example webkit the html rendering engine behind safari google-chrome and other browsers is open source but the safari browser itself is not

folder	directory
screenlets store their configuration in the .screenlets screenletname folder in the user home directory

23463
google-chrome	firefox
in windows 7 is it enough to move all the subfolders of c users username to an encrypted file system to have all the important information like firefox google-chrome and intenet explorer passwords encrypted

23508
uninstall	upgrade
if you delete this folder you will experience issues later when you attempt to repair uninstall upgrade reinstall etc

23521
put	get
i would either use headphones or get some speakers set them to what you want and rip off the volume knob but unless you put super glue on it or something the user will be able to change it - last being a extreme option

23543
cpu	processors
i saw one post where someone said they had a 4 core processors and it listed only two cores under device manager so they deleted those two cores here and let windows reinstall drivers for the new cpu apperently they had changed cpus

23626
filesystems	ntfs
i mount an ntfs volume on linux and i ve had a problem in the past when the filesystems would not mount properly on linux even with the -f force option

23627
google-chrome	firefox
i can still use google-chrome and ie but firefox just sits there without doing anything not even showing the 404 or connection timeout page

23662
google-chrome	firefox
anything similar to about config firefox in google s google-chrome

23670
filesystems	ntfs
even moving files between linux filesystems and fat32 ntfs causes lots of warnings about permissions and ownerships

versioning	upgrade
i can upgrade my bios if some versioning which supports vt is available

23704
cpu	processors

but then again if you use iphoto then all your imported iphone movies become available in the media browser for other apps in ilife iwork

23729
debian	linux
to upgrade the linux debian stable etch to lenny just need to follow these two steps

23729
debian	linux
it is also better if you start your debian linux in text mode so gdm or kdm could be restarted without problems

23770
folder	directory
the only file folder organization i keep in my home folder is directory for document types and i use spotlight to find them

23777
opera	firefox
on this web page firefox and opera running on windows and linux display the source html interspersed with garbage characters for me they appear as black diamonds with question marks as opposed to a rendered web page

23786

in remote control control maxivista transmits the x y mouse cursor position keyboard input and optionally the clipboard contents via the network connection

23823

edit the above is assuming you re on an ubuntu or debian system

possibly you could try to use your function key fn or windows logo + p to make it switching screens to get to your desktop

23874
ati	nvidia
i m not familiar with the standard nvidia drives these days my last card and the one that will arrive tomorrow are atis but centered scales stretched timings when displaying lower-than-native resolutions are an option in the ati drivers

mp3	ogg
or if you prefer how to decode re-encode them into mp3 or ogg vorbis

23945
ethernet	wireless
it might be unrelated but i had a similar type of problem when using the windows 7 beta on my laptop where both my wireless and ethernet connections would stop working

23957
filesystems	ntfs
modern filesystems like ext2 3 4 and ntfs are pretty good at avoiding chronic fragmentation

23957
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
back when windows would start with a fat filesystems then convert to ntfs during the install process running a defragment after install had completed could make a measurable difference

24007
put	get
put a .bat file in your all users startup folder so that it will get run whenever someone logs on

24292
mouse	keyboard
some basic mac keyboard shortcuts can be customized from the mouse keyboard preferences screen

24298
ubuntu	linux
if you use colinux with simple x11 forwarding connecting it to a windows x-server like xming - i believe this is what andlinux and portable ubuntu do you get a nice seamless mode - linux applications run alongside windows ones not in separate window

24313
ubuntu	debian
you can use remastersys to build an ubuntu or debian distro of your own

24384
put	get
if your integrated graphics card is disabled when you put in a new pci-e card you really don t have much of an option you ll have to get two cards with a minimum of three video outputs for monitors between them

then you can get this utility and schedule it to put it back to sleep after it s done when idle

24663

presumably the best way to do this is to hook a laptop up to the projector and then enable some sort of screens sharing between the tablet and the laptop

24817
kde	gnome
so i end up using a lot of gnome or kde apps

24822

25090

take note of the firefox cache folder path specified in cache directory and browse to this folder with windows explorer

25378
ubuntu	freebsd
i was looking for a way to rename a huge number of similarly-named files much like this one a windows-related question except that i m using nix ubuntu and freebsd separately

25495
vmware	virtualbox
i ve tried virtualbox and vmware both reported and error saying they cannot run 64bit

25525
folder	directory
unfortunately that doesn t allow anyone to see that your public folder exists - and there s no way to do that because the existence of the public folder depends upon being able to read your home directory as that s the file that contains it names are in parent directory permissions are part of the file inode.

25582
firefox	safari
i always find exiting restarting safari or firefox if that s your browser of choice tends to help.

25611
kde	kubuntu
i m currently setting up a new xen paravirt domain running kde 4.2.2 from kubuntu 9.04

25613
google-chrome	firefox
also if you don t like ie but don t necessarily want to ditch all of your extensions in firefox consider using google-chrome for those times when you just need a browser up right away

25638
ubuntu	linux
i would try booting it with a linux live cd like knoppix or ubuntu 8.04 8.10 or 9.04

25843
opensuse	linux
you can create a partition through gparted for example from a linux livecd such as opensuse

25853
mouse	keyboard
not really an answer to your question but it looks like you need to try synergy+ which does exactly what you need share one mouse and keyboard with different pc s

25951
cpu	processors
it basically means that people will alter the settings for their cpu processors to go faster than it was designed to do so

25961
filesystems	hfs+
you don t need to add a period to the beginning of a name you can use the invisibility bit which is part of the apple hfs+ filesystems via the leopard command in a terminal

i have a german versioning of vista ultimate installed and would like to upgrade to windows 7 ultimate but the german versioning of windows 7 is not out yet

26280
ubuntu	linux
sudo is installed by default on ubuntu and is available on almost all popular linux distributions in the package repositories

26287
versioning	upgrade
that being said you can upgrade to windows 7 using the normal upgrade route whether your windows vista is in english or not since your windows vista ultimate in german is just the english versioning with the language pack installed

26287
x86	64bit
you might need to install the language pack after which is on a separate dvd marked as windows 7 language pack x86 - dvd multiple languages or windows 7 language pack x64 - dvd multiple languages for 64bit in your msdn downloads

26287
x86	64bit
edit after verification msdn also provides a dvd of windows 7 ultimate with the german language pack already installed marked as windows 7 ultimate x86 - dvd german or windows 7 ultimate x64 - dvd german for 64bit

26415
kde	gnome
the normal way to run a full-fledged graphical desktop on a system is to use a login manager such as xdm or gdm kdm for gnome kde

i ve been trying to create a dual boot with opensuse 11.1 and ubuntu 9.04 and it has been giving me problems

28170
ubuntu	opensuse
after opensuse is finished installing i install ubuntu and try to do a specific partition where i create an 8gb swap partition and the remaining space as my ubuntu partition

28170
ubuntu	opensuse
but i could not continue without create different mount point for each partition which i make the ubuntu partition mount to as i want ubuntu as root but keep the partition for opensuse mount point the way it was which was blank

28170
ubuntu	opensuse
after installing ubuntu it works completely fine but when i reboot and log into opensuse it s no longer bootable

28180
macports	homebrew
i suggest you download ffmpeg from either homebrew or macports

28187
folder	directory
for example the following will create a backup of the c project to backup directory excluding any folder that satisfy

28203
ubuntu	opensuse
you need two ext3 partitions - one to mount as on opensuse and the second to use as on ubuntu

28203
ubuntu	opensuse
do not mount dev sda2 in opensuse you ll use this as the mount on ubuntu

28203
ubuntu	opensuse
we create the ext3 partition for ubuntu upfront so the ubuntu installer does not have to resize the opensuse ext3 partition to create its mount point

28203
ubuntu	opensuse
after you install ubuntu if you cannot see opensuse in the grub boot menu list you might need to edit boot grub menu.lst and add an entry for opensuse

cifs	smb	iscsi	smb	iscsi	cifs
sharing via iscsi cifs smb or nfs is fairly trivial - but in the latest version using the new framework comstar yields some problems

switching	screens
it is quicker for me to glance over to the other screens rather than do window switching all the time when i had one screens

when you run a program your operating system copies the program code from your hard disk to your ram

i tend to use fink when they ve got an up-to-date package and i build from macports if they don t

28540
versioning	upgrade
is there some upgrade path that requires getting the new distro versioning or is just updating sufficient

28544
versioning	upgrade
if you are not using an lts long term support versioning of ubuntu then it is a good practice to upgrade to the latest distribution maybe immediately after release but a little bit later after the initial quirks are smoothed out

28545
macports	homebrew
i switched from macports to homebrew a few weeks ago and i m pleased as punch

28547
debian	linux
i use debian on my linux boxes

28547
dpkg	aptitude
the fink command line is a lot like aptitude and i m used to the dpkg underpinnings

28583
mouse	keyboard
if the machine did not wake up when you unplug something it would never know that it is there again when you plug it back in so if you unplugged a keyboard or mouse and plugged it back in pressed a key or clicked the mouse the system would not wake up again because it has not run the routines to handle it

28591
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
the hid part probably refers to human interface device which is a usb term for keyboard or mouse

28593
versioning	upgrade
so you should prepare your system for a fresh install before you upgrade versioning ie

is there some upgrade path that requires getting the new distro versioning

28593

it will get the updated versioning of the packages configure and upgrade your system

28593

it is not done in usual fashion the packages that constitute the new release don t just show up in the update manager list with no indication that installing them will upgrade you to a newer system versioning

mouse	keyboard
my keyboard mouse phone keys edge of monitors etc etc

28776
mouse	keyboard
it s a good replacement of cmd for any command-line operations if you know or knew nc you know what i mean and from the other side the replacement of explorer if you prefer keyboard to mouse

28781
kde	gnome
i m very impressed with kde and the kwin window manager seems like a better wm than compiz which is what i was using for gnome sure that s an oppinion

28806

some laptops will automatically switch to the external monitor if they re closed and you have a keyboard mouse plugged in

28861
installation	upgrade
i recently upgrade to windows 7 rtm 64 bit fresh installation

28869
stdout	stderr
it would be helpful though if any data going to stderr was immediately recognizeable as such and distinguishable from the data going to stdout and to have all the output together so it is obvious what the sequence of events is

28869
stdout	stderr
yes i can echo the return code when a program finishes and yes i can redirect stdout and stderr

28869
stdout	stderr
what i d really like it some shell script or easy-to-use redirector that shows stdout in black shows stderr interleaved with it in red and prints the exit code at the end

28869
stdout	stderr
in my testing and probably due to the way things are buffered rse and hilite display everything from stdout and then everything from stderr

28879
jive	alfresco
i have looked at some platforms like alfresco open km jive etc but want a more workable solution

28911

i use safari on windows about 30-40 of the time the rest being firefox

28923
ati	nvidia
this problem seems to affect many people as per search engines with the most suspected mentioned cause being insufficient drivers from ati nvidia apparently has updated its drivers for related issues successfully while ati tried that too but some users still seem to have the same issue afterwards

28942
stdout	stderr
what is does is move stdout and stderr about so sed gets stderr in 1 colors it and then swaps it back

29011
stderr	fflush	stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush
this can matter where order matters it often does since stderr is immediately fflush in terminals and stdout is fully buffered when it s not a tty

29022
ethernet	wireless
ethernet outputs and wireless wlan wireless lan ieee

29027

you ll get the stderr in the grep one and the stdout in the main one

existing windows that have had their presets changed will need to be reset by deleting the .ds_store file in that directory as the finder window view options are stored in that file in each changed folder

note this will also cause all other usb devices attached to your computer to be forgotten - so be careful when using usb keyboard mouse you may want to use a ps2 adapter to connect them whilst doing this

mouse	keyboard
because it s faster and doesn t require to move my hand from mouse to keyboard and back when entering data

29301

what you can do though is eventually to use the keyboard as mouse functions from windows in accessibility options i believe which in some case would be faster than pressing tab

vmware	virtualbox
for 64-bit virtualbox or vmware are good options

dpkg	aptitude
since apt-get aptitude etc all internally use the dpkg command we are going to remove all traces of the package installation from the dpkg database and con dpkg apt-get aptitude etc into thinking the package was never installed

29642
ubuntu	linux
if you have not tried yet try booting into a recent linux live cd ubuntu 9.04 or fedora 11 for instance and see if it works there probably will not but it does not cost much to try

29687
disk	ram
if you want you can try loading some of your most-used programs in a ram disk to make them load faster

29689

most bluetooth devices for laptops are done through a internal usb interface so make sure that all your usb root hubs are up to date installed latest chipset drivers for your laptop

29804

opera and firefox use the same flash player but not internet explorer

29804

irc	bittorrent	irc	telnet	ftp	telnet
with proxifier you can work with any internet client browsers ftp irc bittorrent messengers telnet ssh video audio games... through a network that is separated from internet by a firewall only one open port is required for a proxy tunnel to bypass firewall

29866
children	parent
i would remove all permissions from the troublesome folder then grant everyone full control over it and it s children - this should ensure you can rename it and also that any odd permissions from the parent aren t being inherited

29879
mouse	keyboard
in this arrangement i have a laptop with an external keyboard mouse and monitor connected

29923
mouse	keyboard
some kvm switches also have usb peripheral switching capability some aten models -- this is in addition to supporting usb for the keyboard and mouse switching between pcs

29985
switching	screens
changing my focus from the screens to a kvm to switching back and forth just to change music tracks might be more hassle than it saves in resources

30003
switching	screens
if i switching to just using the laptop screens then both panels end up on the same screens

30015
tftp	tcp
recommendations - in order to catch the narrow window for tftp flash you should use platforms with simple tcp ip implementations that don t have ctcp implemented winxp or linux are reported to work but some are reporting significant problems with vista windows 7 or windows 2008

30015
udp	tcp	udp	tftp	tftp	tcp
however what i fail to understand is -- tftp uses udp rather than tcp

30021
mouse	keyboard
this doesn t answer your exact question but if you had an additional monitor for your other computer you could use synergy-plus to control both systems with a single keyboard and mouse

30026
switching	screens
i m not sure this will work as i have a feeling that when you switching to using just the laptop screens this value is automatically changed to the available screens

30026
switching	screens
if none of these work i d suggest you enable auto-hide and set a very low auto_hide_size so the panel is barely visible when you switching to one screens

30028
rss	feed
i currently don t have an rss feed tab in tools- account settings in outlook 2007

30032
rss	feed
you might try subscribing to an rss feed in internet explorer first

30036

when you set up your account in outlook it asks you if you want to use it for rss feed

google-chrome	firefox
i ve had a similar issue within firefox and google-chrome sometimes

30052
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu fedora centos etc.

30106
fink	macports
another installation path you should consider is macports and or fink

30117
kde	kubuntu
as was pointed out in a comment using the autoremove is how you tell apt to remove all orphaned packages that would have depended on the kubuntu-desktop and that should get rid of most if not all kde kubuntu desktop apps

30122
kde	gnome
click it and select gnome instead of kde

30128
irc	bittorrent
other things to consider in evaluating a connection are uptime what ports are blocked isp policies regarding us of bittorrent irc smtp or other services

30172
mouse	keyboard
you will want to look into the drivers under the keyboard mouse and input devices section here

30201
post	get
i ll update this post with the results of the test when i get them

30264
folder	directory
i guess this this has something to do with the directory listing permissions as when i m running a php script in apache that needs to access a folder without the bit set it doesn t list the directory contents

30284
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
running it could install files anywhere on your system and run pre- and post-install scripts and there s no built-in uninstall or upgrade mechanism the system does keep a log of installed packages though so if you later run an installer package for a newer versioning of the software it may behave differently than if it had been a first install

30284
fink	macports
for command line software that you d typically install from source i d recommend a package manager like macports my preference or fink over using an installer package

30284
uninstall	upgrade
a huge advantage of using a package manager is that it ll keep track of installed software and give you the ability to upgrade or uninstall it

30293
google-chrome	firefox
i could be misreading your question but if you are merely having trouble making settings changes to to a linksys make sure you re using msft ie not google-chrome or firefox

apple replaced the keyboard mouse under warranty

30506
installation	upgrade
an in-place upgrade is actually a repair installation using the upgrade option

30506
uninstall	upgrade
so if your original windows vista dvd does not contain service pack 1 you will need to uninstall service pack 1 from your pc prior to attempting the upgrade

30506
versioning	upgrade
note after performing in-place upgrade your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but we may need to run windows update to install all the available updates for your system to update these system files to the current versioning

unfortunately many applications such as firefox and even safari don t actually obey this rule

traceroute	packets
you can t read too much these days into traceroute results - end networks will often filter the various packets that traceroute relies upon

30576
icmp	tcp
even tcptraceroute a useful diagnostic tool as it gets closer to testing the actual thing you want to test - the path of a tcp connection will suffer if the icmp error reply packets are filtered

the second option is ok like phobia said .deb files are quite simple to install but often the upgrade isn t directly supported by installing a different .deb versioning virtualbox ose to virtualbox commercial

32623
ubuntu	linux
it s not a perfect solution this sometimes breaks when you upgrade your ubuntu distribution but i think it s the best you can do for new linux users

32625

udp	tcp
if atop isn t an option then use netstat -anp --inet as root to provide a listing of which tcp udp ports are in use by which processes or possibly use lsof for that

33318
udp	tcp
from there simply iterate over each process that s got an open socket and either attach to it using ltrace -s or strace to look at the reads writes sends and receives or use tcpdump with a filter specifying your local ip address es and the tcp udp ports that were listed

33337

to solve both problems time machine does something new and different that actually required apple to make changes to the underlying mac filesystems hfs+

33523
filesystems	hfs+
the performance hfs+ journaling which accompanies each filesystems metadata update was also improved

33523
filesystems	hfs+

pull	push
essentially all we want to do is have this central repository store all of our source code and for each individual developer be able to push and pull to and from that repository as necessary

33633
pull	push
my understanding of how this works is that each each developer push and pull to the clone url of the repository for example git github.com smalldevteam sourcecode

33734
cpu	processors
check the model of your processors against the intel processors spec finder - it should let you know if your cpu is vt-x capable

33758
windows	winpe
the correct way to do this would be to setup a small windows partition winpe or similiar and have reflect start inside that os

33834
filesystems	fat
dvd iso are often above 8gb so that sort of eliminates fat filesystems correct

33842
put	get
if you have the resources i d put the vm on a box you didn t care much about or at least backup all data in case it does get into your host os

34012
mouse	keyboard
this problem does not occur when the machine s in a docking station -- it only occurs when it s standalone and i am using the laptop s keyboard even with an external mouse

34034
google-chrome	firefox	vmware	virtualbox
proprietary software now fight to survive and some of them turn the open source part to survive longer but it is just bringing more help for the open source to grow so google-chrome will help firefox to grow and vmware slowly goes down cause virtualbox beat it .

34089
versioning	upgrade
what s important to note though if you have multiple clients and subversion changes the working copy format again you have to upgrade all to a new versioning

34433
disk	ram
i haven t heard about ram disk for years until today but why

34433
disk	ram
why aren t ram disk more in use today

34436
disk	ram
ram disk are volatile - data in ram disappears with no power so we can t rely on them

34436
disk	ram
32-bit architecture can only address just below 4gb of ram - you don t want to waste that precious ram as a ram disk

34448
disk	ram
because ram is dirt cheap and a ram disk is faster than a conventional platter hard disk drive by a countrymile or over 300 times

34448
disk	ram
note a ram disk may not be a suitable solution for each and every scenario but where it is applicable it beats any disk drive known to man hands down

34789
disk	ram
hard disk conveyor wide but slow - ram conveyor narrow but fast - grinder processor

34789
disk	ram
at the same time meat might potentially choke at the hard disk conveyor points in short meat that is supposed to be on the ram conveyor in a well-optimized system is actually still on the hard disk conveyor - a.k.a paging swap file

34797
ubuntu	linux
the system is an ubuntu windows dual-boot setup and all works fine in linux

pop-up	dialog
a pop-up dialog comes up stating msn mail is now your default email program. but msn is still not listed in picasa as the default email program

36916
sudo	passwd
edit this won t work with sudo because it will ask for your passwd

36916
kde	gnome
on the other hand i believe that both gnome and kde offer ways to trigger a shutdown reboot without using sudo by sending an appropriate d-bus signal or something

36921

but i tried virtualbox and vmware what s the differents and which are the feutures

37014
vmware	virtualbox
edit after comment to clarify by free i mean libre both vmware server player and virtualbox are free as in cost not money but only virtualbox ose is free as in libre -- see open source virtualbox and other editions

37014
vmware	virtualbox
benchmark vmware vs virtualbox

37015
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox also starts up much faster than vmware in my experience.

37016
vmware	virtualbox
i do find that vmware is not as simple to get going as virtualbox is if you want the free server edition you will be running a little excess overhead to manage the services component

37016
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox also contains a snapshot feature that is only part of the workstation retail version of vmware

37016
vmware	virtualbox
in summary if you want a dedicated machine to handle your virtualization go with vmware but if it s for development purposes on your local machine i d definately go with virtualbox

37017
vmware	virtualbox
i ran into some config issue with virtualbox shared folders weren t working anymore and i didn t know how to enable it again so i tried vmware as i assumed it was a professional piece of code and maybe i could get it going faster than tracing my issue in virtualbox

37017
vmware	virtualbox
vmware didn t solve it so i decided to go back to virtualbox

37017
vmware	virtualbox
thanks to vmware i installed a fresh copy of virtualbox and it s running smoothly

37029
vmware	virtualbox
install a linux vm in both vmware and virtualbox

37031
vmware	virtualbox
i had better performance and a smoother experience with virtualbox but vmware s handling of multiple vms blows it out of the water - so it depends what you re using it for

37078
button	checkbox
when you right click on the volume button press playback devices then highlight your spdif output and press properties - one of the tabs in that section has checkbox for dts and dd - where you can test to see if they work or not

37079
kde	kubuntu
searched ubuntuforums i m using kubuntu hardy because i like kde 3.5 google and other places but i can t seem to find a way to configure it in the way that would work

37095
sudo	passwd
i can mount it fine but only using admin passwd either via the graphical interface or via sudo truecrypt --auto-mount devices

is there a way to install php 5.2.9 alongside php 5.3 and then using httpd.conf or .htaccess tell apache which version of php to use for a particular directory

37154
google-chrome	firefox
i know that google-chrome and firefox have this built-in but i wondered if anything similar was available for ie

37158
x86	64bit
incidentally i found that the snow leopard kernel and many or possibly all of the unix tools are universal binaries supporting x86 32 bit intel x86_64 64bit intel and ppc powerpc

37203
octal	hex
at some point i have no idea when my default umask the nsumask got changed from 18 0x12 hex 022 octal to 63 0x3f hex 077 octal

the default archive manager in gnome and xfce supports read writing 7-zip files i m assuming it s builtin

but i need to use photoshop fireworks dreamweaver illustrator

37288
vmware	virtualbox
tried vmware virtualbox and again - i keep getting audio video problems

37315
folder	directory
now you can either import import into oe by picking the option import mail from an oe store directory or just change the store folder from the maintenance tab to the backup folder

37343
disk	ram
my disk will not fit into the memory so ram disk is not an option

37360
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
can handle windows filesystems fat 32 ntfs winfs

37393
vim	emacs
it s all very well speculating which of the two is more efficient or giving our personal experience but i am wondering if anyone has made a proper statistical study given some text code editing tasks to perform how many key presses it takes to perform the task in emacs and vim

37414
ubuntu	linux
source ubuntu linux desktop qimo

37414
ubuntu	linux
or edubuntu linux for young human beings ubuntu customised for educational use

37418
ubuntu	opensuse
mythtv either on opensuse fedora ubuntu or knoppix there are specialized versions for each of the i.e

37428
wan	lan
because the iptables rule above only deals with packets coming in on the wan interface not from the lan

37428
wan	lan
or the router will drop the packet for some reason simply because it doesn t know how to handle a packet directed at its wan address on its lan port

37468
opera	firefox
p.s. try this in the must have firefox addons thread lads get opera it s got the goodies aready built in

37473
bash	tcsh
what kind of shell should i use how to best configure it tcsh bash

37483
antivirus	rootkit
the slightly more paranoid might give rootkit revealer a shot or an offline antivirus tool such as the one avira has depending on if you think your system itself is compromised the latter won t hurt anyway

37486
installation	upgrade
in other words how smart will the install be like will it notice that there s a perfectly good install of vista basic already and ask me if i simply wish to upgrade to ultimate - or will it pave over my existing installation

37492
opera	firefox
firefox for browsing or opera

37492
kde	gnome
openbox for an alternative window manager rather than gnome or kde -- works great with conky and tint2

37499
mouse	keyboard
for leopard 10.5 it is the same procedure just that you go to system preferences keyboard mouse instead of system preferences keyboard

37501
kde	gnome
i also think that you d want to play around with various ides till you find one you like and get familiar with the command line - i use yakuake for kde in theory but kde apps and gnome apps do play nice as a drop down console though tilde is the equivilent gnome app

37553
punctuation	words
in pretty much every software application on the planet if you double-click on a words it will select just the words not all the surrounding punctuation

37553
punctuation	words
if a words is not part of a formula it will select the punctuation mark symbol every time except for hyphen dash

37553
punctuation	words
it doesn t select the quotation marks or any of the punctuation surrounding the words it just selects the words

37553
punctuation	words
for some reason excel violates this standard and often selects punctuation along with the words

37575
disk	ram
0x40 disables autorun on ram disk

37608
antivirus	mcafee
probably not the best way of going around it but if you need to use mcafee a few other av s actually provide api s out the box - you could always just install it on the server and disable all the active scan parts and then just call the scanner exe via command line arguments and wait for a response code - the same way as many download managers im clients and others hook into third party antivirus scanners

37613
hash	md5
in addition to other criteria it also does matching by content usind md5 hash

37614
switching	screens
is the screens power firmly in and is there a on off switching on the screens

37638
udp	tcp
do some benchmarks on your own and decide which options are the best tcp udp rsize wsize etc for example for nfs here is some old comparison

37653
shell32.dll	regsvr32
type regsvr32 i shell32.dll and click ok

37686

37906
rar	zip
the rar file format is somewhat new to me and i m trying to understand why people are switching to it over the zip file format

37909
rar	zip
lastly the compression on rar is slightly better than zip i think as well and early on i think it had better ways of protecting the data within the archive

37913
rar	zip
zip compression has the ability to break into parts for quite a long time already so i don t think people are choosing rar because of that

37927
rar	zip
winrar has a better interface and i believe for a while it was easier to rar things when you were going to transfer it between os than it was to zip

38000
shell32.dll	regsvr32
type regsvr32 i shell32.dll

38044
daemons	launchd
if you don t mind a little python scripting you could write a daemons that listens to hal for events and then launchd a script once a device of your choice has been plugged in

38073
filesystems	ntfs
rar can store filesystems attributes of ntfs like streams full acl permissions modification access etc time not sure about linux attributes as i prefer tar archives there and thus makes it a nice complete backup tool with decent compression ability

38084
restructuredtext	textile
i personally use latex for these sorts of tasks but if latex really is not an option you might want to consider a lightweight markup language like restructuredtext which has converters to html latex and pdf markdown or textile

38123
filesystems	ntfs
microsoft has an article on restoring default security settings including ntfs filesystems permissions

38141
vmware	virtualbox
smaller than vmware 300mb for vmware vs 70mb for virtualbox download sizes

38164

38261
mouse	keyboard
i use synergy to make different linux and windows pcs appear as one working space for my mouse keyboard and clipboard

38264

the problem would be that you switching screens and thus computers with a special modifier key shift alt ... pressed down

38385

when you apply a filter you only show hide the desired rows

38390
ubuntu	linux
not windows home server because you may find linux in general and samba in particular simpler to set up and ubuntu because people actively use it and you will be able to find answers to your questons quickly

38420
freebsd	debian	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian
the bottom line is after a windows 7 install the only way i could get the ubuntu livecd or freebsd or debian or ultimate boot cd to boot was to unplug the sata cable on the windows partition i was lucky to have more than one hdd

38767
mouse	keyboard
this system does not have ps2 ports and i don t have a usb keyboard or mouse so i m using a usb to ps2 adapter

38846
mouse	keyboard
actually if you have a keyboard or mouse connected to it with the psu connected as well you can close the laptop wake it back up

38891
mouse	keyboard
dr plugging in an using an external keyboard and mouse will wake the device even if the lid is shut

38891
mouse	keyboard
if you are using a wired keyboard and mouse

38891
mouse	keyboard
connect a usb keyboard and mouse to your computer

38891
mouse	keyboard
once the lid is closed wake the computer up by either clicking your mouse button or by pressing a key on your external keyboard

38891
mouse	keyboard
you should now be able to use your apple portable as you normally would using your usb keyboard and mouse

38891
mouse	keyboard
the process is a little bit different if you are using a wireless keyboard and mouse

38906
mouse	keyboard
i do this without an external keyboard or mouse - i use synergy to connect to it over the network instead

38999
folder	directory
while just typing the name is shorter the start command jweede points out is better if you want to open a directory in explorer instead like open directoryname opens a folder in finder on osx

39006
jobs	cron
for instance the output of root s cron jobs will be sent to root so you need to make sure that those emails are forwarded to you

39013
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
in practive this should then call kde-open gnome-open exo-open or possibly even open depending on the current desktop environment kde gnome xfce os x

39079
move	drag
doing so you could pull up either workspace on either screen and also still drag move windows between workspaces

39116

i normally use google-chrome but techniques for ie or firefox would be cool as well

39121
google-chrome	firefox
other than using firefox or google-chrome that is.

39140
sudo	passwd
once you can run sudo commands set the root passwd sudo passwd

so i want to upgrade since this versioning they gave me is a oem versioning i am guessing so i should be allowed to do commerial use stuff with it where as my school copy i can t

39162
cifs	smb
it s not really a fundamental issue with the cifs smb protocol so much as it is an issue of implementation and testing

39206
wan	lan
unless there is a reason to protect the wireless network from the wired network i would disable the dhcp server on the wireless router and then connect the two routers together via lan ports not the wan on the wireless as you do now

linux is similar to dos lots of variations entirely command line and kde gnome are similar to the windows shell that ran on top of dos

41845
kde	gnome
this doesn t however mean kde and gnome are outdated compared to windows it s just a different method of reaching the same goal

this layer handles the hardware level of the gui managing the input from the keyboard mouse etc. and output to monitors etc

the kde framework is known as qt and the gnome framework is known as gtk

if you really have a rootkit in your bios one of the things that rootkit would likely do is refuse to allow any other updates to be applied

42351
bios	rootkit
at least that s what i d do if i wrote a bios rootkit since ya know the computer kinda has to use bios functions to update the bios.

42351
bios	rootkit
the good news is that you probably don t have rootkit and if you are able to successfully flash the bios with one downloaded from the manufacturer asus via the normal means that would pretty much confirm it

with our current setup a hyperlink from the powerpoint file has a relative address to the corresponding part of the help file and if the user doesn t organize the powerpoint and .html files in the same way locally for instance the directory is renamed everything is in one folder etc. then the links doesn t work even though the files are there

43451

couldn t work out how to do anything with the rpm file so i managed to extract the tar.gz archive into a folder on the desktop and with the help of google worked out that i needed to open a terminal window cd into the appropriate directory and use sudo to execute a perl install script

43460

this isn t necessarily a problem with ubuntu so much as it is a problem with vmware choosing not to package its vmware tools as a debian ubuntu package

assuming you didn t touch anything else other than the memory which you may well have done if the memory was difficult to get at without taking the machine apart then there are three main possibilities the memory you put in is bad the memory you switched back to wasn t put in right or you cracked the mainboard pushing it in wrongly or just too firmly

fink	macports
instead both macports and fink will automatically place all of their software in a completely distinct non-apple directory sw for fink and opt local for macports

44144
fink	macports
you can then easily and cleanly use either fink or macports or both and never touch the apple stuff

44144
fink	macports
if at a later point you decide that you want to remove all of fink or macports you can easily do that by blowing away the custom directory with a two-second rm -rf

44144
fink	macports
you can always cleanly uninstall individual packages using fink or macports s built-in tools.

44144
fink	macports
on the other hand it offers fewer packages than either macports or fink

44144
fink	macports
since it s new it also has fewer packages than macports or fink

44365
xfce	kde
while not as powerful and popular as kde xfce worked for me

44365

since i try out gnome and kde every six months or so i have most of the basic useful apps that they bring along with them and they run fine under xfce

should i jump ships and go with gnome or xfce

51097
filesystems	hfs

you can use an application like rainmeter + skins to have rss feed updated dynamically and display as background

51544
mouse	keyboard
the prerequisites are an intel based mac a usb keyboard and mouse and 10gb of free space plus the windows cd or dvd

51561

normally that feed button is shown when firefox finds out a link in that page that leads to an rss feed

51561

when you hibernate go into a suspend-to-disk state your os needs to write copies of data in any active memory pages in ram to disk to the hibernation file in the root of your system drive usually in windows - in your case that could mean writing up to 4gb of information to disk

51826
disk	ram
are you sure that you were hibernating suspend to disk before rather than sleeping suspend to ram

this has helped me before trying to see the amount of ram or the size of a raid disk

52467

opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
safari runs fine but the latest downloadable versions of firefox opera and flock all crash randomly and very frequently

bootcamp parallels virtualbox or fusion

52711
tftp	telnet
quick howto ch16 telnet tftp and xinetd

52715
ubuntu	linux
if you re new to linux consider ubuntu or xubuntu especially the server form

52715
debian	linux
on the other hand if you re very comfortable with linux consider a very light debian install instead -- a typical home server doesn t need the heavyweight desktop gui stuff and your usage would benefit from having as little of it as possible

52721
virtualbox	parallels
granted i haven t tried parallels or virtualbox but i have the impression they re not quite as good in this. so do evaluate it to see if it fulfills your needs well enough - and if it does i think the price of 79.99 is tolerable

52744

to switching between laptop s screens and external ones use fn+f6

52789
vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
having experienced the very very slow performance of both vmware and parallels i d probably go with bootcamp

52793
parallels	bootcamp
bootcamp can be combined with fusion or parallels but unless you need a native windows i wouldn t recommend using it or that option.

52811
virtualbox	parallels
i can t compare performance with parallels or fusion since i haven t tried them but virtualbox is good enough for me to completely forget that i m in a virtual machine when i run it

52812
versioning	upgrade
install or upgrade the windows live messenger to latest versioning

i was opening up a bunch of links in different tabs when one of them had a javascript pop-up dialog

52898

it was trying to force me to download something and no matter how many times i clicked cancel the message dialog would pop-up again

52954
vmware	virtualbox
since virtualbox is free do your proof of concept with it and then move to vmware fusion

52957
wan	lan
set the server access type to be 0 all 1 none 2 lan only 3 wan only

52969
mp3	flac
if you could have a linux fileserver you could put the flac files there and share the filesystem over mp3fs it would transcode the files into mp3 on-the-fly when needed and there wouldn t be any need to store files multiple times

52973
ubuntu	linux
i ve setup a brand new linux machine with ubuntu 8.04

53044
folder	directory
if it can establish a connection it will copy all the folder that you configured it to back up from the windows machine into its backup directory and then it will do some space-saving tricks which you mostly won t need to worry about

you know the friend who already uses linux opensolaris netbsd whatever

53103

your run in a desktop become a kde or gnome or other fanboy and run more or less the same apps no matter what distro you pick

53109
udp	tcp
setup the tcp to udp forward on the server

53109
udp	tcp
on the server we open a listener on the tcp port 6667 which will forward data to udp port 53 of a specified ip

53109
udp	tcp
this will allow tcp traffic on server s port 6667 to be forwarded to udp traffic on 192.168.1.1 s port 53 and responses to come back

53109
udp	tcp
setup the udp to tcp forward on your machine

53109
udp	tcp
this will allow udp traffic on local machine s port 53 to be forwarded to tcp traffic on local machine s port 6667

53109
udp	tcp
as you ve probably guessed it now when a dns query will be performed on the local machine on local udp port 53 it will be forwarded to local tcp port 6667 then to server s tcp port 6667 then to server s dns server udp port 53 of 192.168.1.1

53110
folder	directory
replace path to safe directory with the path to a folder that you want to move the component to

53113
switching	screens
i regularly have a problem when switching between users in vista - the screens resolution drops down to 800x600

53122
udp	tcp
this example i think john s answer points the the same thing at a different place describes how to access another machine s udp dns services over an tcp ssh connection

53122
udp	tcp
we will forward local udp 53 traffic to tcp then tcp traffic with the port-forwarding mechanism of ssh to the other machine then tcp to udp 53 on the other end

53350
ati	nvidia
you may have to go through the card s control thingy as in catalyst for ati or the nvidia control panel instead of the windows dialogue i did

53356
ati	nvidia
take a look in the ati nvidia program and see if you can enable it as a option if it does not support the hotkeys you should manually be able to rotate the screen

53479
width	height
do not include the height and width elements this time

53479
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
the first half of that style is for browsers that support the max-width and max-height properties -- google-chrome firefox opera and safari

53479
width	height
source image max width height

53482
width	height
if you only specify the width or the height but not both you do preserve the aspect ratio so you are probably accidentally inheriting a or something

53499

the server only allows asymmetric authentication rsa dsa and you provided no key

in particular lots of portable mp3 players that support ogg fail to support replaygain tags so if you re normalizing these audio files for a portable device you re probably not going to want replaygain

hfs+	ntfs
there are debian based powerpc live cds that will probably do the ntfs without much trouble but i m not sure about hfs+

53660
hfs+	ntfs
third option is gparted live cd as opposed to partitionmagic free by price but also free-as-in-free-speech which should be able to resize ntfs and hfs+

vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
with the arrival of virtual machine software like virtualbox vmware parallels etc. is cygwin any useful on the windows platform to give a linux like environment

53908
folder	directory
it automatically extracts all of the files in the currently viewed directory when that folder is opened including the archive s root directory

53912
filesystems	ntfs
such files are more likely to occur on fat32 disks than on the more advanced ntfs filesystems

google-chrome	safari
i have to admit i also find google-chrome on the mac extremely fast however never really had issues with safari

54111

on xp the link files are saved as .url and on os x they re saved as .webloc and firefox on either os can t use the format used by the other .url files do at least open in safari on os x

often if i forget to move the cursor away before starting to type i ll find myself moving my hand from my keyboard back to my mouse just to move the cursor out of the way and then go back to typing

high-resolution jpg gif or png image

54172
xfce	gnome
looking at the page that you referenced i would go with either gnome or xfce

54172
xfce	gnome
gnome will give you more of the ubuntu experience while xfce will be a bit lighter weight and still be very gnome-like

54172
vmware	virtualbox
edit i recommend installing a good virtual machine manager such as vmware or virtualbox on your every day pc

force height and width on firefox

54219
folder	directory
technically it is the directory that will be used by certain windows media services components if they are ever installed but because of the way the ocm installation .inf files are set the folder is created whether or not windows media services are installed

54222
installshield	orca
you can change the summary information of an product_name.msi most windows software use msi installer for installation using installshield direct editor or using orca which is shipped with windows installer 4.5 now 5 sdk

i have also tried to use the installed versioning of ubuntu ie not the latest upgrade versioning and still the same problem

54233

not on any linux distro i believe ubuntu does not set any swap priority by default some others might

personally i never found anything that wrong with vista however windows 7 is just a much more polished versioning and if you can upgrade i would

54359
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
you could switch to xmarks formerly foxmarks which has plugins for firefox google-chrome ie safari and maybe more

54468
rss	feed
this will save all your subscriptions in an .opml file which is the standard for a collection of rss feed

54490
ati	nvidia
a generic driver provided by ati or nvidia should be able to scale to the maximum resolution for your chip and monitor but theoretically hp could limit the maximum resolution supported within the graphics driver

54501
ubuntu	linux
you can use a linux live cd ubuntu is recommended as being fairly straightforward to access the vista partition to back up files

54503
disk	ram
i m not sure exactly how you d do this most likely you d create a ram disk put a dmg file on that and then mount the dmg with hdiutil attach -union file.dmg

54553
vpython	pygame
my personal preference goes to simpy for being a python module easy to integrate with a visualization module like vpython matplotlib or even pygame being well documented with examples and tutorials having some plotting capabilities and a programmable gui

54561
textwrangler	bbedit
have you tried textwrangler or its big brother bbedit from bare bones software

54602
rss	feed
feeddemon is completely broken -- it is no longer sucking in rss feed

54683
stdout	stderr
i ve got a program written in python that writes to stderr and stdout

54690
stdout	stderr
assuming your program is called from a command prompt stderr and stdout are by default directed to the console

54690
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr in different files

54690
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr in the same file

54727
config	ini
config stored in an ini file

54729
udp	tcp
and any firewall or router needs to have the ports configured well tcp 6000-6005 for x11 udp 177 for xdmcp and optionally tcp 7100 for the xfs font server for otherwise it will only work using ssh -y after all

54729
kde	gnome
as you actually do have physical access you might be able to set up the machine to your needs but i assume setting up some vcn to some existing gnome or kde session is easier

54745
post	get
if you are at all unsure post your hijackthis log report to a security spyware virus forum not here there are dedicated forums for this and get an experts advice before taking any action

54758
ubuntu	debian
most of them should allow you to install java through their package management system such as apt for debian and ubuntu which is easier and allows for easy updates as well

54776
disk	ram
ram 6gb s vs disk 60 90mb s aprox.

if you have thousands of hosts on a single subnet your switches will be choking on arp dhcp and other broadcasts

i have tried to look for keyboard shortcuts and configure them in freecommander but i haven t found anything and i can t figure out what operation freecommander tries to do when the mouse pointer is crosshairs

in ipv6 the 64bit host part of the full 128bit address is often automatically generated from the mac address of your computer not your modem router

54969
mouse	keyboard
the prime purpose of the katmouse utility is to enhance the functionality of mice with a scroll wheel offering universal scrolling moving the mouse wheel will scroll the window directly beneath the mouse cursor not the one with the keyboard focus which is default on windows oses

54975
xfce	kde
they focus on kde but like the tutorial says it s easy to apply to others like xfce

54985

if you haven t updated the graphics drivers to those provided by the graphics card manufacturer nvidia ati please do so

55096
width	height
where 1680 is the width 1050 is the height and 32 is the color depth in bits

55145
jar	war
it s great for j2ee applications as you can drill down into an ear file then a war file inside the ear then a jar file inside the web-inf lib directory of the war .

55156
folder	directory
the default view options are read and used whenever a new window is created for that directory whether it s opening a new window from a directory on your desktop or if you held the command button when double clicking on a directory folder

55184
disk	ram
you do want to make sure that there is some extra ram for the disk cache otherwise performance can become horrible

55207
versioning	upgrade
i am not aware of any even cygwin did not upgrade its wget versioning yet

55224
ubuntu	debian
i need to do this on two systems one is running ubuntu and the other debian

55225

its on an upgrade installation installing from scratch will take a full-time week as the machine is totally stocked and finding the 3rd party application that is causing the slowdown is near impossible

55475
vmware	virtualbox
suitable linux or opensolaris minimum requirements packages as host platform to run virtualbox or vmware

55477
vmware	virtualbox
hopefully i don t mean to sound dumb here but vmware as you say on something i guess workstation and virtualbox are software based virtualisation platforms - they are designed so that you can do other work on your os and virtualise at the same time

55498
mouse	keyboard
it s probably not the answer you want but you can actually do this using the keyboard by enabling mouse keys in the universal access pref pane

55506
rss	feed
here s the problem though holding shift and re-opening the triangle tells itunes to refresh the rss feed and it s possible that the rss feed no longer contains the item you want

55508

there s a couple encoder decoder who can handle it

opera	firefox
ok finally using firefox i got the key so the site might have been down for some time today - i was trying since morning using ie8 firefox and opera

55544
versioning	upgrade
however i would suggest to upgrade to an unsupported package only if you require some specific features included only in the latest versioning

55546
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu fedora mandriva are all good virtualbox choices

55551
hfs+	ntfs
i am assuming that on the primary drive i will have an hfs+ partition for mac os x ntfs for windows 7 and an ext3 partition for ubuntu

55556
rss	feed
can someone recommend an html page scraper that can turn a webpage into an rss feed

55568
ubuntu	debian
if you want to build up a system with nothing more than you need a ubuntu minimal or debian minimal disk is a good start

55568
vmware	virtualbox
then install vmware server no idea if virtualbox runs headless

55572
cpu	processors
ppc processors do not even implement much of the functionality of a modern x86 cpu because ppc processors only offer a reduced instruction set

55612
filesystems	ntfs
there is no common native filesystems that will allow you to have files greater than 4gb and readable on all three operating systems however ntfs can be read and written to by os x and linux using ntfs-3g

55612
vmware	virtualbox
if you do choose to go down the virtualisation route use virtualbox rather than vmware fusion

55612
vmware	virtualbox
i ve had much more success and performance out of virtualbox than vmware fusion and of course the obvious advantage is that it s free

55616
ubuntu	debian
i m not sure what black magic is responsible but things break weirdly in ubuntu 9.04 and debian 5.0.3 if that line gets changed to anything else

55618
vmware	virtualbox
seriously save yourself some headaches and just use vmware fusion or if you re cash strapped use virtualbox

55618
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
vmware fusion parallels and virtualbox support shared folders or whatever marketing term they ve deemed for addressing your issue

55653
switching	screens
i can t change the comptuers settings switching primary screens every time i want to use a media center app.

55742
cpu	processors
cpu diode or core temperature is the temperature measured across a temperature sensitive diode on the processors die

55742
cpu	processors
the most common implementation uses a temperature sensor part external to the processors with the cpu thermal diode anode + and cathode - connections to it

after opening firefox it might be updating bookmarked rss feed

55796
mouse	keyboard
weeks later when booting up windows 7 the laptop s ps 2 mouse and keyboard did not respond

55796
mouse	keyboard
a solution seemed to be to format the windows partition again and reinstall xp but the mouse and keyboard didn t respond in xp either

55796
mouse	keyboard
the only way to get input to work in windows was to launch it in safe mode or with external keyboard and mouse plugged in before booting windows wouldn t recognise them at runtime and the mentioned workarounds worked 1 out of 3 times at best

55796
mouse	keyboard
i have to mention that the keyboard works fine in the bios and both keyboard and mouse built-in and external worked fine the whole time from the arch linux os

55796
mouse	keyboard
external mouse and keyboard usb

55816
pop-up	dialog
this will pop-up the uac dialog rather than ask for a password like runas does

55830
cifs	smb
alternatively you may be able to mount a network share cifs smb nfs and load it with your software

55839
disk	ram
i setup a new vhd with windows 7 virtual pc rtm with 1gb ram and booted up from the opensuse 11.1 32-bit installation disk

55845
ubuntu	linux
this works fine under windows xp 7 but caused considerable headaches under linux ubuntu 9.04

55880
disk	ram
if it keeps the ram under electricity or stores it to disk

55965
mouse	keyboard
an alternative to allow you dial the volume up or down quicker is to use the mouse scroll wheel for volume or a media keyboard with a dial you can rotate quickly up or down

55994
ubuntu	linux
my usb external hard drive with ntfs format works just fine on ubuntu linux but when i boot the same machine as windows vista it no longer recognizes the drive it used to work fine on windows

56010
folder	directory
one thing you may want to try is to turn off the automatic zipfile directory compressed folder support

56024
ethernet	wireless
easy turn off your wireless adapter and use an ethernet cable to connect to your router

56043
folder	directory
if the . network admin folder exists on your machine simply copy the tnsnames.ora in this directory

56064
ati	nvidia
and just a question does that notebook come with an integrated gpu or the ati nvidia one

56074
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
strangely this is a feature more common on macos virtual applications since virtualbox vmware and parallels all support it

56079
filesystems	hfs+
if it is visible from disk utility try to format it with an hfs+ filesystems and a guid partition table

56096
ubuntu	linux
do you know such a program for linux ubuntu 9.10

56100
kde	gnome
you can see this as a gnome counterpart to kde s klipper

56134
installation	upgrade
how do i upgrade my installation

56134
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
update i managed to upgrade my installation of git but i also realized that my versioning of ubuntu was old so i upgrade to the newest versioning which automatically gave me access to newer packages including git

56137
versioning	upgrade
so if you don t want to compile install the package yourself you ll need to upgrade your system to a newer ubuntu versioning

56163
kde	kubuntu
under kde kubuntu etc there s klipper

56181
post	get
from the washington post weird place to get tech details but they re right

56297
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	debian
the output will likely include fedora redhat debian or ubuntu

56313
rss	feed
is there a way i can display the rss feed that i have subsribed to using ie7 or ie8 under vista and windows 7 as a screensaver

56335
rss	feed
rss screensaver allows you to add new feed and choose a background to display them on for a screensaver although it cannot read them directly from ie unfortunately

56351
mouse	keyboard
i have a logitech wireless mouse for use with my macbook 2.5 years old running snow leopard in external monitor keyboard mouse mode

56393
versioning	upgrade
yes the upgrade editions are not dependent on what previous versioning you have - only the fact that you have a licence of any vista or xp edition

56414
vmware	virtualbox
depending on what you do with your machine you might consider only installing a single primary os and then use a virtual machine vmware virtualbox virtualpc etc. to host any other oses

56518
titlebar	window
heck i d even go for attaching the solution to the edge of the top window border if being actually on the titlebar is impossible

56526
mouse	keyboard
though you may lose things like advanced keyboard or mouse function depending on what you have but you can re-enable that easily enough

56547
opensuse	linux
i m in a bit of a trouble after trying to apply vista sp2 on a dual-boot grub windows vista 32 bits and linux opensuse 11.1 x64

56586
disk	ram
if you run so many applications at a time that you re running out of ram usually you can tell this because your computer starts getting really slow and you hear the hard disk drive crunching then you ll want a 64-bit os and sufficient ram

56598
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 8.04 lts is still my go-to for linux

56599
ubuntu	linux
and it has a completely different kernel than ubuntu not linux so the drivers have completely different underpinnings.

56611
bash	zsh
i took advantage of the fact that bash doesn t have zsh s glitch feature to use parameter expansion substitution to conditionally color the slashes instead of using grep

56614
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
try a different browser such as opera or ie or safari or google-chrome

ethernet	wireless
if your computer is connected via the ethernet cable as opposed to wireless then try out this idea

56678
installation	upgrade
trying out ubuntu installation went fine - upgrade to the proprietary nvidia drivers but on restart i get a login prompt and the screen is flashing really fast almost as if xserver is trying to start and failing i can type when the screen isn t in a flash as it were and it s so fast and random it s hard to even type a login name without it missing some characters - this makes typing a password not being able to see which characters made it or not very hard

56726
srt	subtitle
to use external file with subtitle such as srt start dvd in vlc select play and when film is actually playing drag and drop the subtitle file onto vlc

56757
mamp	wamp
mamp is the equivalent of wamp for mac os x

56782
postgresql	mysql
both the primary open source sql relational dbms - mysql and postgresql - are readily available for mac

56794
versioning	upgrade
rather than issue patches for older versioning the way to get fixes is to upgrade to the latest versioning

56794
versioning	upgrade
if the changed behavior is back-ported to ie7 then they will not upgrade to the new versioning of ie7

56806
fink	macports	kde	gnome
mostly out of pure stubborn curiosity i got gnome working via macports - fink also has gnome and kde and apparently kde is even easier

56826
filesystems	hfs+
hfs+ is the default native mac os x filesystems

56826
filesystems	hfs
alternatively if there is a fuse filesystems in user space implementation for windows you may be able to use that with an hfs plugin although i have never seen it done

56876
folder	directory
this creates a bunch of mbox formated files inside a directory structure that matches the outlook folder structure from which they came

56876
folder	directory
if all went well evo should notice the files and directory and show them as mail folder in the on this computer folder

56974
button	checkbox
on a mac as far as i understand you could move in such a manner only between text boxes no checkbox or radio button no button

56988
post	get
run hdtune in benchmark mode on the disks and see what read write you can get on each and post the results

57072
filesystems	ntfs
â is an invalid character in windows ntfs filesystems

57092
sudo	chgrp
i need the files readable by the apache user i was trying to set all files to be but this doesn t do anything gives no errors just has no effect. i tried changing the group using chgrp to my user group but that won t work either it gives me errors that i lack permission even when i run all those commands as sudo

57097
switching	screens
for wmp you can switching audio tracks by going to full screens mode and then right clicking on the video

57103
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
it seems linux mint is based on ubuntu 9.04 which uses a 2.6.28 kernel

57107
folder	directory
i use this to sync most of my user directory but not my music folder for example

57132
vmware	virtualbox
i know it s a bit different but you may also want to bite the bullet and look into a fully virtualized environment such as virtualbox vmware or virtualpc

57138
ubuntu	debian
i m trying to migrate from ubuntu jaunty to debian sid in order to avoid changing the port every 6 months on ubuntu

57138
ubuntu	debian
i m planning to replace the ubuntu respo by the debian one in etc apt source.list and do an apt-get upgrade or probably dist-upgrade

57150
ubuntu	debian
if you attempt an apt-get dist-upgrade you might end up with inconsistencies in your system where some of the old ubuntu packages are left over and conflicting with the newer debian packages

57150
ubuntu	debian
i ended up following these debian bootstrap instructions when i did an ubuntu - debian migration a couple of weeks ago on a home server

57150
debian	linux
the process allows you to install debian from a running linux system which worked for me because a i was installing debian to a separate hard drive b i wanted to perform most of the installation steps via ssh and c i m crazy enough to try it

57151
mouse	keyboard
windows has to be installing the wrong driver for the keyboard and mouse

57152
mouse	keyboard
after that check the acer site for any mouse keyboard related support issues or downloads

57154
mouse	keyboard
the best i can think of is that rather than the usual ps 2 the keyboard mouse is being recognised as a usb based device and some how the usb drivers root hub has become corrupt or an incorrect version installed

57160
mouse	keyboard
drivers i think maybe trying older drivers for usb keyboard mouse might help

57161
ubuntu	debian
or do what i did in the opposite direction resize the ubuntu partition and install debian side-by-side with it until you re comfortable

57176
doc	rtf
another way if i remember correctly is to save document as rtf then save again as doc

57214
ssl	https
however a vpn can still be filtered using l7 for example but if your connection allows access to https online banking for example this solution should work l7 might still be able to classify this traffic as ssl certificates are sent unencrypted a self-signed certificate might be filtered out

57217
versioning	upgrade
i know a long shot but i d try to upgrade the drivers to the recent ones maybe they ve added the support for multiple displays with the latest versioning

57254
mp4	h.264
mp4 is a container format and could contain many different codecs divx xvid aac h.264 or the mac format that joe referred to

57275

58834
versioning	upgrade
the difference is that upgrade versioning require you to have a previous versioning of windows that you are upgrading from such as xp vista etc

58851
versioning	upgrade
the basic idea is to install vista as a trial versioning then upgrade it .

58856
versioning	upgrade
in my experience a windows upgrade install will ask you to insert the cd dvd of the prior versioning to verify that you own it

58856
versioning	upgrade
the legal solution is to return the upgrade and get the full versioning

58856
versioning	upgrade
on the other hand if you get the original media as suggested above and they send you a disk with the full versioning on it then you have what you need to upgrade legally

macbook	bootcamp	vmware	bootcamp
i ve just purchased a new macbook pro and was looking at installing windows 7 via bootcamp so that i can do visual studio development work but i was thinking it would make more sense to move my non development stuff email etc to the mac and launch windows 7 via vmware fusion

if you build a faraday cage and put both your hotspot and laptop inside it then you might get close to it s full throughput

59506
rar	zip
transferring small files across the network might amplify the slowdown in which case you would want need to roll them together into an archive using a tool such as zip rar tarball etc.

59524
put	get
put the fusion vm library window on the space where you want your vm to be fullscreen it will get obscured by the fullscreen vm - but you probably don t need to interact with it much anyway

59562

that said you may want to look at upgrading your wired lan to gigabyte ethernet and if an option upgrade your wireless to the full n standard granted not much gear out if you re excluding draft n items

its built-in terminal is somewhat underpowered but if you also have putty on your computer and tell winscp where it is and set the preference to remember your session password and pass it to putty it will do what you ask - from an open winscp session you can do a ctrl-p and it will open a putty instance connect it to the same server and log in with the password you used to log into winscp

you can turn off directory browsing and then people will not be able to see the contents of folder which do not have a default document defined

from what i have read so far the most likely configurable candidates are the temp folder and possible the users directory tree

versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
my take on it is you run into problems with upgrade if you install uninstall reinstall a lot of programs keeping up with new versioning of those programs etc

60688
versioning	upgrade
i m considering getting a 30 copy from win741.com 1 as i am a student but it seems that it s only possible to get the upgrade versioning and not the full versioning and there s no way i m spending upwards of 200 on this indulgence

60820

i have used ubuntu for about 2 and a half years now so i can vouch for that being good but if you really want to learn all about linux i think slackware is a better choice

60824
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
personally i use redhat enterprise linux at work so from that bias i would recommend fedora or centos

the community support via the wiki forums and irc is every bit as welcoming and useful as the gentoo or ubuntu communities both of which have a reputation for being friendly and accessible

hash	md5
a md5 hash is good enough for most menial tasks

61466
hash	md5
simply fire up md5 and hash the iso

61467
pull	push
the case also has a shield that partially encloses the top of the cpu fan this makes an easy path to pull cool outside air directly onto the cpu my setup or if you prefer push the hot air from the cpu outside of the case i found this less effective

61477
hash	md5
md5 is widely used as a checksum hash function because its fast and presents a extremely low collision ratio

it may be better for your friend to post the question so we can get some more details

ant	maven
i have a large amount of command-line utilities that i use in day-to-day development eg maven ant grizzly mplayer case tools etc

rar	zip
rar and zip files often come as multi-part archives which need unarchiving by a suitable utility winrar 7-zip

61556
vmware	bootcamp
in theory it should speed up i o operations though the performance gains will be i suspect marginal given my experience with vmware fusion + bootcamp

61610
google-chrome	firefox
it happened on 2 machines google-chrome and firefox both can get it

61612
ubuntu	linux
what i need is any good linux distro with nice installer like synaptic and fast bootup speed like ubuntu 9.04

61713
ubuntu	linux
i know some linux distributions are better at handling the microsoft virtualisation stack and have native support however i do not think ubuntu is one that is compatibly out of the box

61713
ubuntu	linux
you can obviously still use ubuntu without problems however you will not benefit from the enhanced support and integration you get with either microsoft os s or the above linux distributions

61727
bash	zsh
bash is used by default in every linux distribution i have tried over alternatives like z shell zsh

61728
unix	bsd
still these were the glory days of bsd unix as sophisticated companies who could afford the 50 000 fee would buy the at t license but install the 4.x bsd distributions and universities got it for free

61728
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	ash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
you had at least tcsh zsh bash and ash

61728
unix	bsd
the bourne syntax was official being part of at t releases but in those days bsd was quite important and sun initially bsd distributed a fair amount of the unix sw that the world encountered

61728
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	ash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
csh would have been eclipsed by tcsh and zsh even if ash bash and ksh had not won the syntax war

61733
bash	zsh
i do use zsh as my regular interactive shell but bash dash seem more sane to me as a shell scripting languages

61778
filesystems	hfs+
i suppose one problem would be that the filesystems in that image is usually hfs+

mp4	h.264
the problem is that the mp4 h.264 file generated is always regarded as a 4 3 format in any player i tried media player mplayer vlc etc. despite the fact that the frames are actually 16 9

right now we can freely adjust each application s position in the taskbar but within the app itself the windows can t be reordered for example multiple windows of firefox or google-chrome

62138
vpn	lan
clarification i want to be able to see dialups wireless firewire lan miniport vpn etc

62145
disk	ram
combine this with the disk swapping consideration and you would likely find that adding ram appropriate to the workload likely to reduce overall energy usage

62154
subshell	dash
this executes shopt in a subshell thus no second call to shopt required and uses -- so that files starting with a dash will not be interpreted as arguments to mv

62179
versioning	upgrade
so i have a question is it safe to upgrade my current ubuntu up to versioning 9.10 via apt-get or it is better to reinstall it from scratch

62179
versioning	upgrade
as i know for windows it is always better to reinstall from scratch than upgrade it to higher versioning and get unstable system

62187
ubuntu	linux
while it s mostly a requirement to do a fresh install with windows and even some linux distributions ubuntu is not one of them

62194
mouse	keyboard
typically the feature you want is accomplished via option emulatewheel although you will need a keyboard equivalent to mouse buttons 4 and 5

upgrade obtain a 32-bit versioning of

62217
x86	64bit
they do seem to contradict each other in the fact that it isn t clear if you have 32 bit or 64bit at the moment however the thing that they do have in common is that the dvd you are using is the opposite to what you are needing - either you have x64 64bit and are trying to use a x86 32 bit disk or you have x86 32 bit installed and trying to use a x64 64bit disk

62302
cpu	processors
so if you try to up your processors bus speed to 133 mhz you ll end up with a cpu sped of 133.33 18 2400 mhz which is a pretty tall over clock

i have just installed 9.04 and although it was pretty easy i don t want to do a clean installation of it to upgrade to 9.10 i would have to backup what i ve done etc

62647
uptime	reboot
i still see the same sort of degradation after a couple weeks of uptime but now when i reboot instead of rebuilding the array the os forces a check-disk where it often finds a couple of errors fixes them with no problem and then continues booting

62658
google-chrome	firefox
try the same web site with another browser like firefox or google-chrome if the bar drops down then stay away from the website

62673
installation	upgrade
this problem seems to have occurred on two separate installation of windows 7 upgrade from windows vista

62677
disk	ram
maybe it s still writing ram to disk then

62677
disk	ram
1 â hibernation mode with ram contents written to disk system totally shut down while â œsleeping â and slower wake up due to reading the contents of ram off the hard drive

62677

ram is powered on while sleeping but ram contents are also written to disk before sleeping

62684
installation	upgrade
i recently upgrade by windows xp desktop to windows 7 using the home premium upgrade installation dvd

62684
installation	upgrade
if i decide to go with a new hard drive do i have to do a minimal xp installation before i can use the windows 7 upgrade media and license key

62685
filesystems	ntfs
while the ntfs filesystems is relatively safe against this sort of thing it journals filesystems metadata like ext3 does by default under linux so some corruption due to unplanned events can be repaired it does still sometimes happen

62735
disk	ram
when confronted to random bugs the first things to check are your ram memtest86+ and your hard disk e2fsck

62756
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
pc inspectorâ file recovery 4.x is a data recovery program that supports the fat 12 16 32 and ntfs filesystems

62785

can i upgrade my rtm versioning and still keep all my settings and programs

62785

to clarify the rtm is a full install versioning and i have the upgrade media

62800
sorting	filtering
sorting is fine filtering is fine

62859
debian	centos
other choices include debian and centos amongst many others

62860
ubuntu	debian
but to be honest jboss would run nicely on ubuntu server too that you might want to choose if you like debian based distros

62876
mouse	trackpad
or find some drivers that have an option to disable the trackpad when the mouse is plugged in

62887
folder	directory
directory access starts to bog down once you get over 5 000 files in one folder

62901
gif	png
is there a reliable and trustworthy app that can tell whether a file is a gif jpg png swf avi wmv etc etc

62917
vmware	virtualbox
the actual virtual machine monitor in virtualbox is a device driver in windows exactly the same as vmware or virtualpc

62917
x86	64bit
a 64bit os must have 64bit device drivers so you cannot install x86 virtualbox on windows x64

62940
mp3	wav
on a related note is it theoretically possible to losslessly recover the source mp3 audio from a decompressed wav

62940
mp3	wav
suppose i have a wav that was decompressed from an mp3 file and assume i don t have the mp3 itself for some reason

62943
mp3	flac
the reason the flac is larger than the mp3 of the same data is because they encode differently

62943
mp3	flac
mp3 just encodes perceptual information while flac stores every single speck of data just in a more compact format

62943
wav	flac	bmp	png
converting a wav to a flac is like converting a bmp to a png

62943
mp3	wav
converting a wav to an mp3 is like converting a bmp to a jpeg

62943
bmp	png	mp3	flac
i bet if you convert the jpeg to png you will see the same kind of increase in size as you see when converting mp3 to flac since the perfectionist lossless codec needs to remember every little jaggy and artifact that wasn t in the original bmp

62945
mp3	wav
to answer part two if you convert back to a wav from the mp3 then pick a lossless encoder you should have an identical-quality file when you re done

62945
mp3	flac
as to why the flac is bigger than the mp3 you re taking one of the more-compressed formats decompressing it then recompressing it in a less-efficient compression tool though with a higher-quality of playback

62950
decoder	encoder	mp3	flac
the flac encoder doesn t care if the audio it s compressing came from a decoder mp3 or a brand new cd it will simply reduce the size of the source file without any change to the audio data making a full recovery of the source possible a lossless process

62950
mp3	flac
a flac file made from an mp3 will sound exactly like the mp3 a flac file made from a cd track will sound exactly like the cd

62957
firefox	safari
this happens in firefox as well as safari

62974
mp3	flac
and flac and mp3 is not even close to similar

62984

63054
short	base
the current priority is made up from the base priority and a number of factors which determine whether it should be boosted or not - being in the foreground does not itself necessarily boost priority but things like coming out of a wait state or doing some io can give a short temporary boost

63054
x86	64bit
on a 64bit version of windows this would be start high priority excel max high c program files x86 microsoft office office12 excel.exe unless you are also running a 64bit version of office which is only available for 2010 onwards start high priority excel max high c program files microsoft office office14 excel.exe

63082

i d recommend one of the more user-friendly linux distros like ubuntu if all he does is email web surfing and light word processing like my mother-in-law but if he wants to run something not available on linux very common reinstall windows

is there a keyboard shortcut in outlook 2007 to flag an email instead of having to mouse click the little flag

63161

however i was very confused over this as most important sites use ssl and gmail definitely works over https

63161

am i correct in thinking that you re only at risk if you re using anything that s not using https ssl

filesystems	hfs+
can gparted rewrite the partition map delete the linux partition and then resize the remaining hfs+ partition without trying to enlarge the hfs+ filesystems

if so you might then be able to use diskutil to enlarge the hfs+ filesystems to fit the bounds of the newly grown partition

if you post your os you can get an exact answer on how to do it

63617
versioning	upgrade
as mentioned an upgrade versioning of windows voids the licence it is upgrading so you can t legally use it again

63617
versioning	upgrade
due to the way windows 7 was being distributed in the eu microsoft said that an upgrade versioning would not be available until 2010 so retail versioning were discounted to the price of upgrade versioning many retailers still branded these as upgrade

63855
tunnel	vpn
basically if you have two vpn routers you can connect them together with a vpn tunnel

63855
tunnel	vpn
creating a vpn tunnel from a pc using it s vpn software using windows to create a tunnel gives you either point-to-point pc to pc or point-to-station pc to vpn router tunnel

i would like to create a similar folder structure on the linux machine but its not clear whether to place these folder under usr home or swomewhere else there seems to be abffling number of choices so i want to get it right first time - i.e having a directory structure that most developer use so it is easier when communicating with other ubuntu linux developers

in this case the key prtscn on the keyboard can capture the screen to the clipboard except it won t capture the mouse pointer which is sometimes wanted.

ubuntu	linux
being fairly new to ubuntu linux i ve been told how great it is to install update and remove program using package management

64209
ubuntu	linux
try a linux livecd ubuntu or backtrack linux systems are often better at reading broken file systems than windows

64216
cpu	processors
to give you a taste you re going to need a little bit of oomph graphically and with cpu and ram recommended is dual-core or better on the processors or more and 1-2gb+ of ram

64219
ubuntu	debian
i almost always do inline upgrades of my ubuntu and debian systems rather than fresh installs

64231
decoder	encoder
you could substitute other tools for any step -- mencoder and others work fine as a decoder and any tool that encodes ogg can be used as the encoder -- although i think you ll be hard-pressed to find a better tool than sox for the concatenation

64231
decoder	encoder
you could possibly output to a raw pcm format in step 1 and use cat for step 2 but that would only work if they re in the same format and you d need to be extremely specific to both your decoder and encoder as to what format they should expect

64242
mouse	keyboard
i want to be able to press a configuration of buttons on my keyboard not my mouse to select bookmarks

64249
folder	directory
you could uninstall dropbox and then reinstall it with a custom directory within the itunes auto-sync folder

64249
folder	directory
or if the choice for a custom directory isn t available you could try just copy pasting the dropbox directory into the auto-share folder

64251

it should also show you min and max download time for each page and lots of other statistics

ubuntu	debian
ubuntu like its parent debian follows the filesystem hierarchy standard

64296
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu policy or debian policy manual is the definitive resource for this

64359
ubuntu	linux
once you have installed virtualbox go download yourself a distro of linux personally i would recommend ubuntu as it is very user friendly but theres a whole load of distros located here

64376
hide	show
you can hide or show as many of the featured windows dock them in other places or let them float as free standing windows

ubuntu	debian
all packages in debian ubuntu have corresponding source packages though it is not always a 1-to-1 relationship as one source package may build into several binary packages in the case of large projects

64403
dpkg	apt
you can get the files from there though you are better off using apt and dpkg as this will reduce the risk of your local machines idea of what packages it has getting badly misrecorded though this is much less of an issue for applications than it is for libraries

64403

that page is for debian but the ubuntu packaging process is pretty much identical by design

the only thing i can think of is to install a virtual machine host vmware or virtualbox on both machines and then sync the folder holding the vm guest between them

64696
ati	nvidia
so most likely that port can drive the 720p and 1080i on the hdtv provided you are using the cable that came with the card nvidia and ati cards have different standards from my experiance

64761
stdout	stderr
if you want to collect both stdout and stderr in the same file use this tells the shell to copy stderr 2 to stdout 1

64778
mouse	keyboard
i just put it in another room and used a long screen cable with ps 2 keyboard and mouse extenders

64828
firefox	safari
i thought it was the browser or something safari so i downloaded firefox but i have watched the download speed decrease consistently as time goes by and right now it s at 8kb sec instead of the 60-200 range it started at

64874
ubuntu	linux
for some reason when i booted linux ubuntu to clean a locked virus on each partition mounting was fine and the virus was deleted

64892
versioning	upgrade
this will depend on which versioning of windows 7 you upgrade to but that was also the case with xp

64917
put	get
when i connect from other linux it says transfer timeout on get and put command

64935
ati	nvidia
in you particular case i would suggest you to think to replace your nvidia 275 with the newest ati 5000 series that supports by default 3 monitors

64963
vmware	virtualbox
maybe it ll have to be converted for vmware or virtualbox

64970
debian-based	ubuntu
this is developed and tested on a debian-based system so it should work on ubuntu

64970
ubuntu	debian
we re going to take advantage of debian ubuntu s existing rules let them setup the symlink for us and add another rule that will mount the device for us

64970
put	get
on my system hal rules are in a file called 90-hal.rules so i put my rules in 89-local.rules so they get processed before they get to hal

64974
ati	nvidia
assuming the key hkey_local_machine software nvidia corporation installer listed by pã r bjã rklund is correct i can t check i m an ati guy

64992
dpkg	aptitude
to make it more concrete what s the relationship among apt-get apt-file apt-cache aptitude and dpkg

64992
dpkg	aptitude
i know that aptitude is the friendly front end to dpkg - so is apt-get but less friendly

64992
dpkg	apt
is all of the apt s the front-end of dpkg

64995
tinyurl	bit.ly
i come across urls from bit.ly tinyurl is.gd etc

65003
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
this is also true for other virtualization software such as virtualbox or vmware or parallels

65033
parallels	bootcamp
i can run windows on my apple laptop exclusively through bootcamp or through virtualization through parallels

65049
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are known to be slow on localhost when ip6 is enabled

65095
daemons	systemd
apparently both can run either as a systemd daemons or as a user-session mount manager a la gnome-vfs -- the files are in charge of systemd settings

65103
installation	upgrade
it s also worth noting that i was not prompted to prove that my installation was an upgrade during the installation - the only hitch came when i tried to activate

65129
disk	ram
will be dumped on disk so you can live happy with a swap partition ram size

65171
folder	directory
however it seems to store the backed up files in a strange mess of folder and directory

65229
mp3	flac
i ve seen this happen with cds that include extra media i recommend using another app to rip your cds like exact audio copy or foobar2000 both provide secure offset-corrected ripping freedb database access and encoding to the format of your choice mp3 flac vorbis etc though you ll need to download the encoders separately

65249
folder	directory
as long as your library is pointing to a folder on your data drive you only need to change the directory the library points to after you reinstall windows

65314
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
on one network all transfers between pcs running debian or ubuntu linux had 3mb s speeds but when i was using scp on a mac os x server i always got over 6mb s

65314
debian	linux
only time i ve gotten faster transfer speeds with debian linux and scp are when i ve copied data from one xen virtual machine to another on the same xen server then i would get 20+mb s speeds

65324
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux and i was trying to install the java jdk with ee on ubuntu

65336
daemon	cron
the above is coded i created and tested with cron and the apache httpd daemon

65337
ubuntu	linux
if i had to i could use a linux app since i dual-boot ubuntu 9.04

65371
disk	ram
i wonder how or if any one tried to create a ram disk and then put the 2gb or sometimes 1.2gb .vhd file into it and then run the virtual pc using this image

65377
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome work just fine

65377
google-chrome	safari
what i don t understand is why safari and google-chrome takes it right away

65379
vmware	virtualbox	disk	ram
but if you have enough ram to create a ram disk capable of storing a whole image know that both virtualbox vmware and virtualpc are capable of caching your images as data is accessed

65379
disk	ram
so while the ram disk doesn t necessarily become redundant its performance increase over a cacheable image will not be that great

65382
google-chrome	firefox
is the common set up for google-chrome that it will use a different dns server while firefox and ie will use the os networking default

65382
google-chrome	firefox
my google-chrome including one on virtual pc will sometimes show resolving host and wait there for 20 30 seconds while firefox and ie won t

65408
versioning	upgrade
i was having problems with ubuntu recognizing my apple slim aluminum keyboard until i upgrade from 8.04 to a newer versioning of ubuntu

65442
google-chrome	safari
the ajax.googleapis.com url loads fine on my internet connection and i assume safari and google-chrome still have the library in their caches

65449
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i don t know what is different about how opera launches the terminal versus how safari and firefox do it though

65451
ubuntu	debian
it is packaged on ubuntu and debian along w above..

65460
ubuntu	centos
i m most familiar with rhel centos fedora and ubuntu though

65463
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
there are also quite a few alternatives to it virtualbox free vmware workstation paid or player free parallels paid

65485
ubuntu	linux
i m running ubuntu linux

65516
installation	upgrade
a fair number of upgrade come through the pike in the first few weeks after an ubuntu release since suddenly the number of installation and the variety of hardware and application use goes up radically

65541
vmware	virtualbox
i wonder why virtualbox and vmware s player both capture and bound the mouse pointer to the virtual machine and not let it come out and needing to press right ctrl key or ctrl-alt to come out

65541
vmware	virtualbox
so i wonder why virtualbox and vmware s player do it that way and can it be configured that they don t

65592
jboss	weblogic
the follow-up question would be do i need to set up jboss weblogic websphere

65635
folder	directory
how can i move only the plain files not the directory from one folder in linux to another folder using the mv command

65639
ati	nvidia
also the nvidia ati graphics vs

65643
svnkit	subclipse
yes you need to upgrade your subclipse plugin svn connectors either javahl 1.6.x or svnkit 1.3.x so they match support your installed subversion 1.6.5

65668
itunes	iphoto
how to stop iphoto and itunes from opening automatically when plugging in an iphone

65719
notepad++	textpad
if it s just a matter of searching it without changing anything no search replace export the whole registry to a .reg file and use your favorite text editor that supports regular expressions notepad++ textpad pspad ...

65783
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
ask also for installation instructions whether you need to uninstall the old versioning before installing the new or just upgrade

65798
switching	screens
edit it looks like the photo is always stretched for both the logon screens and after i hit the switching user button after i lock the computer

65817
put	get
i realize that i didn t get the subtitles so what i want to do is convert the avi to mkv and put the subtitles in the mkv

65847
ethernet	wireless
station-infrastructure doc refers to this as connects as client to wireless router provides over ethernet

65880
tunnel	vpn
i would notice a statistical deviation if you hypothetically suddenly started tunnel a vpn connection out on port 80 or something

65949
debian	linux
debian reference introduce the debian linux operating system all aspect

65974
mouse	keyboard
i have a usb mouse plugged into the keyboard s usb hub - this always works fine

65998
subscript	superscript
can t get anything that looks very good but you can add a fraction then right click that to remove the dividing line fraction bar this at least gives you the effect of a superscript directly above a subscript which looks ok

66002
installation	upgrade
start the installation upgrade or

66005
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
note that the link is a direct download to the firefox safari opera plugin

66052
bash	zsh
does bash zsh + coreutils count as an advanced file manager

66083
mp3	flac
differentiating a 320kbps mp3 from a flac or audio cd is difficult even for most healthy ears

66089
openbsd	linux
if blocking p2p traffic is a real issue you might want to get a real firewall linux openbsd etc

66090
width	height
i also increase the width and height of the screen and make the buffer much bigger as when i am doing admin type things i tend to want to go back further - some of those

66091
wav	flac
any lossless audio format will do for instance flac or wav

66091
mp3	flac
keep in mind that even lossless audio formats are only as good as the source that s being recorded so it wouldn t make sense to convert mp3 to flac or use flac for recordings off the radio or a cassette tape

66123
inherited	properties
in general copying a file will inherited the efs properties of the target but a move operation will not inherited the efs properties of the target folder

66123
filesystems	ntfs
the access denied error message is returned to applications from the ntfs filesystems in order to ensure compatibility with existing applications

66160
filesystems	ntfs
as hugh said ntfs has data streams beware though ms claims it may not be supported in future filesystems and just that sentence is enough for me not to use that feature

66194
ssl	https
i want to have all my content from my blog distributed in a ssl encrypted connection meaning i want to go https

66203
mouse	keyboard
but now none of the usb ports recognize any of the usb devices such as mouse keyboard thumbdrive nada.

66203
mouse	keyboard
ps there is no ps2 ports for both mouse and keyboard

66206
pop-up	dialog
when i later on launched mspaint i was expecting windows xp to pop-up a dialog to warn me and say that the file had been tampered

66245
ubuntu	linux
as far as choosing a linux distro ubuntu is very popular and user friendly if you prefer more of a challenge and don t want to be spoon fed with setup wizards try slackware its not normally recommended to beginners but worth a shot

66305
firefox	safari
below see safari on the left and firefox on the right when the microsoft opentype arial font has been installed in 2008 os x and browser versions

66310
ubuntu	linux
i ve just installed ubuntu my first time installing linux and i ve got my first error

66331
folder	directory
if not are there any workarounds to increase the number of folder allowed in a directory

66382
postgresql	mysql
consider storing your data in a postgresql mysql or even a sqlite database

66410
put	get
i m actually able to put in my vpn information username and password but when i click conenct i get the following message

66426
freebsd	linux
this tool is multiplatform for windows linux freebsd and mac os x

66426
ubuntu	debian
the only thing i don t like is that the installation package for debian ubuntu is done incorrectly and places some unnecessary files under can be deleted safely

66495
mouse	keyboard
then click on use the computer without a mouse or keyboard most likely the 3rd option in the list

66497
folder	directory
is there a certain folder or directory where i should be keeping this website

66503
versioning	upgrade
i m using firefox 3.54 and just upgrade the firebug add-on to the latest versioning

66507
cpu	processors
bear in mind that the cpu usages are averaged across all processors cores but most programs do not make efficient use of all cores

66507
cpu	processors
for instance if you have a dual core processors and you are running an intensive application that is doing most of its processing in one thread the application s process will not tend to show more than 50 cpu usage

66564
mouse	keyboard
far too easy to press these by mistake especially if you re like me and prefer the keyboard to the mouse

66575
ubuntu	debian
if you re running ubuntu or debian i think you can install it with sudo apt-get install trickle and then run it

66591
vim	emacs
it s not emacs but vim has a console version

66645
versioning	upgrade
for some reason it doesn t let me log in and want to force an upgrade i really don t like the new versioning

66676
stdout	stderr
what are the gui session s stdin stdout stderr hooked up to

66677
stdout	stderr
it does have stdin stdout and stderr

66677
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr go to the console log in

66712
mouse	keyboard
use ps2 for keyboard and mouse

66730
mouse	keyboard
my guess would be that the iogear didn t work because of it s unique usb sniffing technology for usb mouse and keyboard emulation

66732
folder	directory
i was wondering if i could create a junction directory so that i can have both my music folder redirect to a common library folder

66734
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
to see the wrong headers if you re familiar with such tools you can use things like firebug s net panel in firefox or web inspector s resources panel in google-chrome or safari

66738
versioning	upgrade
it occasionally conflicts with another add-on after a firefox versioning upgrade though so i currently have it disabled

66739
switching	screens
current performance gripes are the time to switching between osx and the vm in full screens and occassional appearance of coherence when it is most definitely off in my environment which causes crawling performance for a few minutes occassionally

66757
put	get
is there an app which can run as a widget or systray app that can remember a magic combo of most used most recent folder so i can get straight there also to have an option to put the path into the clipboard would be great

66777
vmware	virtualbox
the issue here is that yes you can convert your existing system to a disk image and then use on in virtualbox vmware fusion or parallels.

66782
vmware	virtualbox
see the article virtualbox p2v success for how to convert a windows machine to virtualbox by using the vmware converter

66782
vmware	virtualbox
as virtualbox is able to use vmware s vmdk the problem is solved

66802
mtu	icmp
under windows there is a registry setting to enable blackhole router detection enabling path mtu discovery to function when there are misconfigured routers firewalls in the path blocking the icmp fragmentation needed messages

66865
opensuse	linux
i ve tested in linux opensuse and windows vista x64 and it works really fine splitting in 4gb zip encrypted files so i can burn them

66871
textarea	textbox
if you re talking about the textbox suddenly highlighting around edges i m guessing that this how chrome tells you that you re working in a textbox textarea

66875
mouse	keyboard
for my current setup i only need mouse and keyboard switching

66877
switching	screens	mouse	keyboard
however if you only want keyboard mouse switching you might try synergy which connects computers over the network and lets you simply move the mouse from one screens to another to switching where your input goes

66907
ubuntu	debian
i use debian rather than ubuntu but i would be surprised if ubuntu really had security updates daily

66909
switching	screens
whenever i switching tasks in ubuntu alt+tab the switching takes place instantaneously but i have to wait a second before i can use the new screens because the task preview window comes up after the switching stays on the screens for a moment and then disappears before i can use the new screens

66930
ubuntu	linux
i d suggest getting an ubuntu live cd and booting into linux then using badblocks to scan for physical defects

66956
prop	each
you need to open the materials tab and go check every each texture used on every figure prop select the ao node s and hit delete

67005
gtk	gio
newer gnome uses gvfs from gtk s new gio for network shares and similar

67033
switching	screens
you can leave your x server configuration the same and have one large desktop as far as that software is concerned but still switching workspaces on the two screens independently

67085
photoshop	paint.net
if i scale an image the same amount in for example paint.net or photoshop the result is much better

67093
mouse	keyboard
you may then zoom only the text while using the keyboard ctrl +-0 or the mouse ctrl scroll-wheel

67096
debian	linux
i haven t the windows documentation but on debian linux i use

67135
disk	ram
i have a kick-ass vista system 64-bits version with 12 gb of ram and lots of disk space

67200
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
if you don t like ie or firefox you can also install opera or google-chrome as viable alternatives

67233
cpu	processors
i have a intelâ coreâ 2 quad processors q9550 installed and it is supposed to feature sse4 and virtualisation instructions cpu flags vmx and sse4_1 but cpu-z reports it does not

67247
tiff	png	gif	png
with some pdf images extract you can capture the images from the pdf and save them into many different formats including jpeg png tiff gif and lot more

67261
ati	nvidia
ati and nvidia cards should all have this now unless the manufacturer removes it in some editions

67296
google-chrome	firefox
my firefox google-chrome the menus and such is set up like this my the book mark items that are normally on the bookmark bar are moved to be next to the file edit menus

67465
disk	ram
i want to tell the operating system to stop using my hard disk and only use ram as a cache instead

67465
disk	ram
b buffer all disk writes to ram

67465
disk	ram
unfortunately the wince ram overlay driver was very hard to use and i managed to corrupt the disk at the end because the order in which i was supposed to unload and flush things was very particular

67465
disk	ram
i have now installed a ram disk ramdisk plus on my win7 box and tried to install portable apps on it but i don t think that even installing a user profile on the ram disk putting all temp files there etc

67479
unix	solaris
i don t believe the whenever possible clause might be a problem here since i m in unix solaris where permissions retention is afaik possible

67511
public	protected
turn on public folder sharing and turn off password protected sharing

67523
gentoo	linux
i m trying to setup a dualboot with gentoo linux and windows 7

67533
x86	64bit
on 64bit windows c program files x86 mozilla firefox firefox.exe -p

67542
cpu	processors
i encounter a problem these day when i turn on my pc or wake it up from stand by i see my cpu usage is on 100 when i monitor my processors by procexp.exe it s shows me that helpsvc.exe get my 100 of cpu i want know what is it

67567
disk	ram
on a dual core amd 4400+ with nothing special and 6 gb of ram the 64 bit install took me 26 minutes from disk insertion to a start menu

67569
windows	winpe
otherwise if it s a windows based installer i would suggest creating a winpe bartpe boot cd and installing off a flash drive winpe bartpe flash drive should also work

67636
ubuntu	linux
upon the several answers i want to refine my question host os is linux ubuntu

67667
vim	emacs
vim does and emacs does too i m sure

67701
bash	zsh	vim	emacs
bash does have a vi mode which you can edit your commands in a more like vi way than emacs bash default zsh has a vim mode

67726
ubuntu	linux
1 boot from the ubuntu live cd if possible or another linux live cd and try to mount the root partition on your hard drive manually

67729
versioning	upgrade
please note that i am not able in this case to upgrade to a later versioning of office

67745
gif	png
that s virtually the only case in which gif gives smaller file size than png

67745
gif	png
paletted png with 1-bit transparency like gif work perfectly in ie6

67745
gif	png
paletted png with 8-bit transparency not possible in gif work partially in ie6 degrade to 1-bit

67745
gif	png
true-color png with 8-bit transparency not possible in gif don t work in ie6 without hacks

67745
gif	png
in short if picture can be saved as non-animated gif it will certainly work as png in all browsers without hacks

67749
kde	gnome
debian can be a good fit to old hardware if you don t select the installer s desktop profile all of gnome and kde

67761
mouse	keyboard
disconnect any usb ports leave only the mouse and keyboard where ever they are

67765
sudo	passwd
but what i see the next day is the screen where sudo asks me for the passwd

67765
sudo	passwd
so how could i run sudo with passwd in one command line or is there any other method to do this

67769
sudo	passwd	passwd	visudo
you could also configure sudo with visudo to allow you user to use make as sudo without passwd

67803
disk	ram
the other modes ewf disk and ewf ram modes at minimum require a separate partition to operate

67912
sudo	passwd
sudo is a little more vulnerable to attack than su as you don t always need to supply a passwd to have privileged access to some resources depending on how it s set up

67914
pop-up	dialog
my windows computer pop-up a dialog offering to download the photos as if it were a camera

67932
cpu	processors
everything works well most of the time but for the last few days every morning after my computer has been idle overnight i find that rundll32.exe is consuming a steady 50 of cpu all of one processors

67935
ati	nvidia
you won t find a driver for screen but you will find in their tools at least for ati nvidia and intel probably others too a way to set the brightness the color strength etc

67936
pop-up	dialog
find your exact model number in the model browser dialog that pop-up there are a couple of w1934s models listed

68047
cpu	processors
51c is not especially hot for a cpu but do you know the temp of your gpu the processors on your video card

68056
filesystems	ntfs
i don t have a solution that will work in all situations however on ntfs filesystems first edit your cygwin environment variable adding ntsec

68060
mouse	keyboard
remove any external devices besides your keyboard and mouse and see if you still get the messages

68063
portrait	landscape
some pages are setup as portrait others are setup as landscape

68063
portrait	landscape
is there a way to define which pages should print as portrait or landscape or is it an all one way or the other type of thing

68074
google-chrome	firefox
even i close firefox google-chrome ie or the hulu desktop app when they start getting choppy or laggy the processor still maxes out

68085
google-chrome	firefox
i use this ability in firefox and need to find it in google-chrome

68127
wav	ogg
firefox 3.5 adds support for ogg and wav playback using the html5 element

68127
wav	ogg
however it also defaults to opening a media player in the browser whenever i follow a link to ogg or wav

68127
wav	ogg
i ve set the action for ogg and wav to â always askâ in the â applicationsâ tab on preferences but this is ignored

68176
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
xubuntu uses the xfce window manager which is less resource intensive than gnome or kde

68208
ubuntu	linux
i have correctly configured a dual monitor setup on ubuntu linux karmic 9.10

68264
redhat	fedora	debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i m not extremely linux familiar but i ve heard all these different types like ubuntu debian redhat fedora etc

68279
put	get
put the following code at the end of your .vimrc and you ll get filetype detection again

68282
ubuntu	linux
this is for linux specifically ubuntu 9.04

68303
ubuntu	linux
i was thinking maybe there s a linux distro that s less demanding than ubuntu that i can use or some way to run a decent linux within windows without virtualizing

68304
ubuntu	opensuse
i m running ubuntu and opensuse on top of my windows xp

68308
kde	gnome
you could stick with ubuntu in a vm keep the benefits of broad community support etc. and try a less demanding windowing environment than gnome or kde

68309
mouse	keyboard
you can join them together and share the keyboard mouse with win2vnc or x2vnc

68315
pull	push
i use git for all my source control and just push and pull from a remote repo to share code between my vms it s just easier that way than setting up something special

68324
pop-up	dialog
if your camera supports picture transfer protocol over usb and most do just plug it in and windows should pop-up a dialog for downloading the pictures

68329
vmware	virtualbox
ubuntu+text editing shouldn t be a problem for virtualbox or vmware

68406
opera	safari
you can do this for selected text also up to 500 characters in most browsers except safari v3- safari v4 is okay and opera

68442
kde	gnome
edit if you re working with the gnome or kde gui network managers look for a set this interface as default option in the configuration for your eth1 device

68486
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
you may see the common bin bash or something less common like bin tcsh bin zsh or something else entirely

68486
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
of course if you want a shell other than bash you ll say which tcsh which zsh or similar

68518
gentoo	debian
also i m quite inexperienced with debian more used to gentoo and after reading some documentation i m quite confused about how to install unstable testing packages can someone point me some good documentation

68523
ubuntu	linux
if you can t then download a live version of a linux distro i would say ubuntu but you use linux to mount ntfs at your own risk

68533
ubuntu	linux
as for ubuntu security vs xp security yes it is true that there are less viruses written for linux and there are less known exploits and attacks against linux

68543
rss	feed
is there an easy way to add an rss feed in chrome to your bloglines account

68561
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard between multiple

68561
ubuntu	linux
i ve used it on windows 2003 ubuntu linux and mac osx all at the same time

68635
emacs	textmate
i m trying to get my emacs color scheme set up like i have it in textmate

68654
vmware	virtualbox
if you d like to create your own as well look into vmware server virtualbox or virtual-pc

68655
filesystems	ntfs
gparted can read the updated partition table but it gives an error message regarding the windows xp partition something about ntfsresize tool and i think that the ntfs filesystems on the windows xp partition still contains the old size or other corrupted data

68659
webkit	gecko
a lot of them will but probably some won t because fluid is based on webkit and they were made for firefox which is gecko

68669
disk	ram
ram will make some difference to things like file compression or audio video processing but again these are just as likely to be disk limited so the ram will only make a very small difference

68671
installation	upgrade
as you cannot make an in-place upgrade of xp to windows 7 you will lose the permissions on the folders when you make a fresh installation

68794
pop-up	dialog
an error dialog pop-up and again i have to re-open nautilus with gksudo

68794

any time you switch to a very new distribution debian vs bsd based for example you will have to invest some time learning the ins - and - outs of how to administer that type of system - this is where the largest differences are between different types of gnu linux

72488
ubuntu	debian
the advantage to get this working properly with ubuntu is its fantastic debian support

72546
hfs+	ntfs
having a ntfs partion a hfs+ partition a ext3 partition and a fat32 partition

72559
rsa	dsa
generate 1024 bit dsa key could also be rsa but then 2048 bit or more

72604
ubuntu	debian	kde	gnome
i m on debian kde so i can t recreate this you should be able to open whatever menu editor there is on gnome and look at the entry for the ubuntu software center find the box labelled command or something similar

72818
switching	screens
for remote desktop press ctrl + alt + pause to switching the client in full screens then ctrl + + - will work normally

72900

amusingly enough you can use an ethernet cable to run the signal making it not so wireless

72902
ubuntu	linux
when i m running in ubuntu though any changes i make to the raid will not be backed up to that external because i don t have a linux backup plan

72927
hex	binary
you do have to either hex edit a flash binary or you can use the one he supplied if you trust it

72946
switching	screens
the screens change is distracting while i m trying to figure out which window to switching to based on the thumbnail preview which is sufficient for me most of the time

72951
tar	md5sum
doing a md5sum on the tar would never work unless all of the metadata creation date etc. was identical as well because tar stores that as part of its archive

72984
srt	subtitle
aviaddxsubs is a simple to use free program to subtitle videos converting the original srt files you may have

media playback mp3 m4p wmv wma dvds etc

72991
ftp	telnet
ftp sftp ssh telnet automation

72993
kde	gnome
however uiwise i found that kde is more windows like than gnome

72996
kde	gnome
either kde or gnome are fine for the purposes you list here - they aren t really competing on features per se more on the general feel and look of the system

72996
kubuntu	gnome
kubuntu starts with the panel at the bottom much like windows gnome starts with it at the top more like osx sort of but you can move everything anyway

72996
switching	screens
as a beginner i d just look at some screens shots of each and pick based on that - it won t make a massive difference and it s easy to switching from one to the other once installed anyway

73013
ubuntu	mint
mint is a popular rebuild of ubuntu with a few ticks to make windows users more comfortable menu installer et al

73027
pull	push
i m trying out mercurial for the first time but am having problems doing a push pull clone with a remote server in this case it s codebasehq.com when using tortoisehg

73076
kde	gnome
e.g i can t stand using a kde box - but other people would hate to use my gnome desktop on a day to day basis

73076
kde	gnome
web browsing firefox 3 on kde or gnome will be most like you are used to

73076
kde	gnome
file indexing search - tracker beagle on gnome not sure on the kde options

73076
kde	gnome
windows live - kde will use kopete gnome will use empathy or pidgin

73076
kde	gnome
if you d rather avoid this i suggest you use a lightweight file-browser such as thunar which will be more responsive than nautilus gnome or dolphin kde

73132
filesystems	ntfs
i ve seen ntfs performance go down on large sizes though i had not that big filesystems yet

73167
mp4	h.264
then you can use handbrake or avidemux to rip the movie to h.264 mp4 or to mpeg4 avi

73219
macbook	bootcamp

on a computer configured with firefox or opera as the default it just causes the default browser to prompt you to open or save the file

73275
pop-up	dialog
i work with many csv files and am constantly annoyed by the excel dialog that pop-up when i try to save a file

73293
filesystems	ntfs
for example windows uses the ntfs or fat32 filesystems

73293

check that the filesystems is ntfs and hit ok

73310
gmail	hotmail
such as hotmail gmail or just about

73338
ubuntu	linuxmint
i am using an older toshiba laptop and am very happy that i have replaced win xp with linuxmint based on ubuntu

73340
opensuse	linux
if you re new to linux may i suggest opensuse

73347
ubuntu	linux
i think you should try xubuntu its a light weight version of the normal ubuntu and ubuntu is known for being among the most user friendly linux flavor for beginners and powerful enough for experts as well

73360
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is probably the most user friendly and in my experience the best for learning linux if you re not used to it

73375
switching	screens
when i switching the tv to pc the screens is nearly centered with a slight offset

73388
bluetooth	usb
i have a bluetooth mouse and have used the usb ports to connect a gps and the sd card slot to read a camera sd card

73413
ubuntu	debian
i use debian normally but whenever ubuntu releases a new version i tend to use it for some time

73413
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu i observed that the backup battery shows 2.15min but the same in debian shows 1.40min

73436
16-bit	64bit
as 16-bit is now totally abandoned in windows 64bit i don t think there is much point in reporting it to microsoft

73466
ubuntu	linux
windows 7 vista also seems to detect hard disks not detected by xp also i found out that if xp cant detect a hard disk ubuntu linux also cant detect it if they both os are installed side by side

73470
vmware	virtualbox
i m using virtualbox 2.1.4 and want to convert a vdi file to load it in vmware 3.0.0 build-197124 on vista home premium

73481
xfce	kde
opensuse is not normally considered lightweight but during the install i just chose xfce rather than kde as the desktop

73532
folder	directory
currently i m storing everything in a folder in my home directory sh

73566
next	except
if you make the sideshow and set it to run on a particular screen with auto next slide it should work except for the when locked part

73578
mp3	flac
audio aac coreaudio aac he-aac os x only mp3 flac ac3 or vorbis

73595
ssd	sata
any standard sata based ssd will work with any sata based socket

73595
ssd	sata
if the computer takes sata drives you should have no problem using ssd sata drives

73606
ssd	sata
i cloned my existing sata hard drive to it and then booted off the ssd

73606
ssd	sata
an ssd drive is drop-in compatible with typical sata hard drives

73612
mouse	trackpad
edit i know about the emulate three-button mouse option but that won t work for me because the trackpad only allows you to click one button at a time

73615
ubuntu	linux
is my system ubuntu 9.04 doing something special or am i forgetting something on how linux works in general

73625
ubuntu	linux
if you re unfamiliar with linux and have no idea what you might like try ubuntu but be ready to use others because they vary widely

73627
pop-up	dialog
this dialog should pop-up

73666
disk	ram
macs newer than about october 2005 use safe sleep which saves data stored in ram to the hard disk as well

73666
disk	ram
if your computer loses power while it is sleeping it will restore ram contents from disk

73673
ubuntu	debian
it might well be that your debian and ubuntu installations have a different record of your battery usage history they have a different record of how much energy you typically use in one unit of time

73673
ubuntu	debian
an experiment you can do is to actually check if the actual duration of the battery is the same under debian and under ubuntu

73678
move	drag
two of my favorites are automatically sliding back to next area of a page when you get to the right edge and two locks - one that does not let you skip to the next or previous page without an extra drag and another that only allows vertical scrolling so you cannot accidentally move the page out of the text area

73686
versioning	upgrade
if what you want to do is an upgrade to versioning 9.10 the very first thing to do is a full backup of course

73689
vmware	virtualbox
sure it s called virtualization and there s a lot of software to do that vmware and virtualbox are popular ones

73710
vmware	virtualbox
you might prefer virtualbox open source or vmware commercial but free versions also available which are essentially the same thing as virtual pc but do explicitly support linux

73740
ubuntu	linux
it is based on ubuntu but comes with more things to make the windows to linux transition easier

73790
mouse	keyboard
i have neither a microsoft mouse nor a microsoft keyboard nor any microsoft software installed on my mac

73857
mouse	keyboard
could the computer have had a microsoft keyboard or mouse connected at any time in the past

73871
ssd	sata
ssd - sata 2.5-inch

73900
debian	linux
i compiled and installed a custom linux kernel using debian kernel-package

73939
disk	ram
short of setting off an emp every time you want to clear your history any system that keeps your history in ram and doesn t write it to disk will probably do what you want

73959
installation	upgrade
based on the premise that some dll went wrong and if you have a real windows installation dvd meaning not just a restore one you might try to do an upgrade installation

73975
put	get
if all else is lost take it outside and get a garden hose pressure washer on a low setting and simply put as much water as you can over it to get rid of all tea residue.

73979
ssl	https
how can i easily make apache2 respond to ssl just for test proposes - i don t want a real certificate just a fake to make local https work

74008
ubuntu	debian
the option you need to tweak is grub_gfxmode in etc defaults grub assuming grub s conf files are the same on ubuntu as they are on debian

74021
hash	md5
they then respond with either whoa that hash is totally a virus or nope that md5 doesn t look very virus-y to me

74042
firefox	safari
seems like both firefox and safari on mac cannot show the webpage in a full screen mode

74042
firefox	safari
for firefox or safari

74045
firefox	safari
i think it is a design decision that firefox and safari both don t show the favicon the little icon for a website next to the bookmark s title on the bookmark bar

74045
firefox	safari
any simple way to make it work for firefox and safari

74046
titlebar	window
this is a really silly and stupid question but is there a way to change the text of the titlebar for a wine window or any window for that matter

74048
firefox	safari
it isn t possible to go full screen with firefox on mac safari s probably similar in this case

74149
ubuntu	linux
i suggest the wubi linux distribution since it s a variant of the very popular and easy to use ubuntu linux

74190
disk	ram
though this is not directly related to ram disk this may help you get around your problem

74201
pop-up	dialog
select the taskbar tab of the taskbar and start menu dialog that pop-up

74206
filesystems	ntfs
my os is windows xp sp3 and filesystems is ntfs

74210
bash	zsh	fish	bash	fish	zsh
so many times the characters on the bash gets eaten up and not displayed when used as a server and some python stuff is done and i know this is bash s problem because zsh and fish dont have the problem

74212
hide	show
i have also set my options to always hide files and folders and it still show them in the library

74239
ubuntu	debian
on debian and thus ubuntu the apache configuration files are stored under etc apache2

74316
ubuntu	debian
it seems to require modifications to xfree86 drivers which is why there s no debian ubuntu package

74362
switching	screens
i ve thought of using a command line to lock the pc which will take it to the switching users screens but what i really need is for it to actually switching to a specified user

74406
ubuntu	linux
is there a google wave desktop notifier for linux ubuntu

74423
ubuntu	linux
this is regarding wintv hauppauge mythtv linux ubuntu 9.10 audio

74549
ethernet	wireless
i make it so that all of the desktop machines that have ethernet connections have a locally set ip no dhcp reservations and everyone on wireless hits my wireless router for a dhcp assigned ip

74603
disk	ram
for people out there who insist on 64 bit usage - there are some things that would not work in 64 bit environments that could benefit a performance gain from a ram disk that could access past the 3.25 mark in a 32 bit environment - specifically applications that page often

74603
disk	ram
ps there is a reply to this post stating that putting a page file on ram disk makes no sense

74603
disk	ram
if the system has 4gb ram and you make a 2gb ram disk and put the page file there then yes this configuration makes no sense

74603
disk	ram
however if the system has 8gb ram and you make a 4gb ram disk accessing the extra memory that 32 bit windows can not reach and put the page file and temp folder and turn on readyboost and add any other frequently used files on there then yes the speed up is very considerable

74603
disk	ram
and yes is the answer you can get software that allows you to create ram disk above the 4gb limit on 32bit systems

74625
width	height
note that if you re using a browser to view the image and you include height and width attributes on the img tag it should show the zoomed-out view for you

74639
udp	tcp
video conference tcp 9000-9999 5004-65535 udp + 80

74733
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu live cd to get an access to the broken ubuntu after running a few linux kernel magic commands without knowing completely what i did

74733
ubuntu	linux
the output means apparently that ubuntu s linux kernel does not support the feature loop

74750
vmware	virtualbox
check out virtualbox and vmware server

74759
vmware	virtualbox
both recommendations - virtualbox and vmware - are awesome

74763
kde	gnome
this answer has tips on how to do it on gnome or vim but these don t work on kde

74768
unix	bsd
as for downloading the list check out httrack available for windows linux unix bsd

74792
logmein	hamachi
logmein hamachi is a hosted vpn

74799
mouse	trackpad
i thought it was just the button on the trackpad itself but it was doing the same thing when i plugged in a mouse to the usb port

74800
stdout	stderr
both log some info to stdout stderr

74820
versioning	upgrade
they can try and get used hardware and run mac os x 10.4 with classic but they ll need to upgrade their versioning sooner than later

74843
mouse	trackpad
an external mouse has no bearing on your internal trackpad

74871
pop-up	dialog
when i press the scan button on my scanner plus setting the options and pressing start on the scanner a dialog box pop-up titled brother dcp-7040

74892
folder	directory
it is hardcoded into gedit that the initial default save directory is the user s home folder

74914
switching	screens
- separate x screens does allow me to separate workspaces but does not allow me to switching to a workspace from the other x screens

74917
disk	ram
also make sure to align the partition of your ssd and make proper use of a ram disk

74923
folder	directory
this does not include moving the whole user directory just some of the data folder

74925
kde	gnome
not aware of a way to do it in kde or gnome at least not easily

74956
mouse	keyboard
the xkbset line is critical to switch on mouse actions from the keyboard

74972
post	get
if you do install other utilities and still get the error please post here what programs you installed

74979
versioning	upgrade
i would advise you upgrade to the latest versioning - vmware workstation 6.5 should be a free upgrade for you

74980
filesystems	ntfs
problem is that since windows doesn t really recognize the ext2 3 4 filesystems it s a lot more convenient to keep a ntfs partition as a shared partition for content like pictures videos etc. for the two os s

75018
firefox	safari
we ve been advising they download firefox but a few have suggested filing a bug with safari

75074
mp3	wmv
like pdf wmv mp3 quicktime etc

75090
pop-up	dialog
i have seen the dep dialog pop-up on two occasions once when running blender and more recently when running skype

75105
filesystems	ntfs
is there a simple way of disabling permissions on an ntfs filesystems

75109
pop-up	dialog
i use the always ask me where to save files option as a weak safeguard against this sort of thing since it pop-up a download dialog that i can always cancel even if i click yes to the web site s dialog

75129
firefox	safari
i usually don t want to install 3rd party app for this purpose as you never know what the app does or how trustworthy it is if it is not a popular app like firefox or safari

75132
put	get
i want to put these on a netbook for the kids to watch on holiday but want to get the file sizes down from around 2gb hour to something more reasonable

75135
mp3	wav
create a task that opens a sound file wav or mp3 for example and give it the time you want it to launch

75158
mouse	keyboard
autohotkey can automate keyboard and mouse functions but not knowing enough about your setup i ll simply have to say have fun

75164
rss	feed
if it has an rss feed you can subscribe to it in google reader and email it from there in one click but it only works on rss feed

75199
put	get
you could make an encrypted disk image on it and put your files in that or get an ironkey

75226
jobs	cron
manage aspects of the router through cron jobs

75254
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know of any way to avoid this in internet explorer or google-chrome but if your users use firefox they can go to tools options advanced encryption and click select one automatically under when a server requests my personal certificate

75292
sudo	passwd
if you are really worried about someone doing something malicious on the box do not give them sudo or root passwd obviously privileges period

75323
pop-up	dialog
when i reboot my suse linux machine after i log in i am constantly bombarded with pop-up dialog with the title software signature is required and asking do you trust the source of the packages

75329
firefox	safari
iâ ve downloaded from bizspark msdn with a mac using both firefox and safari

75333

75342
lan	intranet
the local lan intranet sites are not opening on my vista system

75350
kde	gnome
so as implemented in kde and gnome this is beyond not easy - it s darn near impossible

75410
ati	nvidia
if it an older nvidia card the will most likely be ok but it may complain a bit having say an old ati matrox etc

75426
screens	tablet
i m the owner of an hp pavillion tx2120us tablet pc which has a known problem of making the cursor jump to the lower right corner of the screens

75426
screens	tablet
yet after a reboot the screens still seems to react to the tablet pen

75431
firefox	safari
i also believe this option is available on safari and firefox as well

75442
installation	upgrade
what i mean is if i do an in-place upgrade will it act like a clean installation of windows 7 with all my programs docs etc

75444
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to windows 7 it will typically do an in place upgrade and keep all documents and programs installed where you left them and just upgrade the versioning of windows

75446
ubuntu	linux
can be on pc mac or even ubuntu linux

75448
installation	upgrade
no an in-place upgrade is not like a clean installation

75545
robocopy	xcopy
i know that xcopy is marked as deprecated with robocopy being its replacement

75570
ssl	https
header cache-control public max-age 999999 used over ssl https is causing that encrypted pages can be cached by browser

75590
msg	eml
you can either import the msg into outlook express and save them as eml files or use outlook extract

75599
udp	rtp
vlc can stream using http mms udp udp doesn t work for me rtp and icecast

75679
opensuse	linux
i want to create a virtual machine from the installed opensuse 10.3 as i have a lot of software and settings in the linux partition and run the virtual machine from xp

75681
freebsd	centos
the sender is centos receiver is freebsd

75684
versioning	upgrade
so i eventually upgrade to ubuntu 9.10 and even though it has the same versioning of libdvdcss it works fine now

75691
versioning	upgrade
so you can upgrade to win7 x86 now and if you purchase more ram later you are still licensed to run the x64 versioning

75694
ubuntu	linux
must desktop linux variants come with one in the standard repositories ubuntu 9.04 unr installs one in the default install and you will not doubt be able to find free examples for windows too

vmware	virtualbox
try virtualbox free or vmware not free but well worth the money.

75749
width	height
should show the resolution in height and width

75772
x86	64bit	versioning	upgrade
x86 32-bit to x64 64bit is not supported in any versioning of windows through either upgrade or anytime upgrade

75784
ati	nvidia
software that allows you to adjust colors with more control and precision than you get with most ati nvidia display drivers

75784
ati	nvidia
i find that some of the ati nvidia drivers perhaps for older graphics cards lack enough control to really allow an accurate match with printed output

75816
ubuntu	linux
i m fairly confident that drivers for these devices exist in linux as i ve installed ubuntu on a netboot very similar to this one previously well that one was baby-blue not pretty-pink

75830
ubuntu	linux
i would try slitaz 2 just to see linux pure speed ubuntu to learn the basics and straight when you get confortable with it you could use chakra live cd to install arch linux you will have a hard time but you will maybe have this netbook for a lifetime up-to-date with decent software on it .

75868
mp3	ogg
i want to retag all my music collection mp3 ogg etc with replaygain info but i don t want them to lose their original file timestamp as sometimes i want to know when i added a file to my collection as it helps me find them by sorting them in my favorite file manager by date

75872
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade ubuntu and it worked on 9.04 but not anymore in 9.10 check that you are booting the right kernel vmlinuz-2.6.31- something and not the one from previous versioning vmlinuz-2.6.28- something

75879
notepad++	textpad
i could do this easily with textpad then i got irritated with textpad once i d played with notepad++

75891
folder	dir
unpack it and change dir to result folder for example subversion-1.8.1 - latest one

75899
spaces	delimiter
to avoid problems with spaces in directories and names this version of the command uses the | sign as delimiter for the fields

75933
octal	hex
you used to be able to enter addresses in either hex octal or as dwords as described on this page but none of my modern browsers seem to support it any more for any number of good reasons

75934
octal	binary	octal	decimal
one of the possible reasons why binary fails is that the numbers are interpreted either as decimal or octal not binary

75934
octal	decimal	octal	hex
and there can be many variations of those - one octet can be decimal other in octal yet another in hex

75954
ethernet	wireless
best solution is an ethernet cable if you have less than 40 meters to avoid the walls unless you ll certainly have to go wireless but 60 meters without an decent antenna gain is going to drop the bandwith down

75960
firefox	safari
i can not login to or or with safari works fine with firefox

75978
gmail	hotmail
is there some form of vpn or encryption that i can use so i can say log in to securely to my hotmail or gmail account without the proxy being able to see my password

75986
ubuntu	linux
updated a reason i am asking this question how do non-geeks or cli-paranoid get to configure their ubuntu linux machines

75995
disk	ram
some apps will slowly leak ram and then the system starts disk swapping which can really hit performance

75996
switching	screens
i have three computers and three screens wherein i would like to be able to switching between the following setups

75997
mouse	keyboard
for controlling all three pcs with one keyboard and mouse

76013
solaris	bsd
what i d suggest instead would be to use os level virtualization like solaris zones bsd jails and gnu linux vservers openvz freevps

76014
mouse	joystick
can your friend operate a mouse or a joystick

76019
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade downgrade to an earlier versioning of xp pro sp2

76055
redhat	fedora
redhat and fedora are similar

76055
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based off debian

76055
redhat	fedora	debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
in debian ubuntu you use .debs and in redhat fedora centos you use rpms

76057
freebsd	linux
freebsd is the main bsd distro bsd is more secure than linux but more limited it s also more structured than linux between projects but some softwares won t compile on it .

76066
freebsd	linux
freebsd - this is not a linux distribution but rather a member of the bsd family which is mainly focused on being a mainstream server platform and supporting as much i386 hardware as possible

76066
redhat	fedora
fedora 12 - also great as a development platform - it s based on redhat distribution therefore is rpm based

76066
gentoo	linux
other great development platforms include arch linux if you re comfortable with some configuring - it s ranked 1st in updated software and gentoo

76083
redhat	fedora
in 2002 or so two forks were created fedora and rhel redhat enterprise linux

76083
kde	gnome
they all can run gnome kde or openbox desktops

76083
debian	centos
that means debian buntu fedora slackware mandriva or centos

76096

all personal settings get saved in your home directory so nothing gets lost when i eventually move the app to the applications folder

it s worthy of note that when i plug the keyboard in and have device manager open i can see it refresh as if reacting to a change but nothing on the list changes not under unknown devices nor keyboards hid

hash	md5
i came up with this idea to take the md5 sha-1 sha-256 or whatever hash of a common english word such as superuser and use the hash as the wpa2 key

76224
mouse	keyboard
you can now start your session from the new window or new tab menu items and of course a keyboard shortcut can be assigned in keyboard mouse in system preferences

76225
vim	emacs
short of an ide both vim emacs contain plugins that can get either editor to perform many of the functions of an ide including autocomplete and jumping to function definitions

76362
folder	directory
running this from the command line either in nircmd.exe s directory or if you copied it to your system32 folder

76378
versioning	upgrade
that means that my scripts can be upgrade to later versioning on my schedule not the maintainers

76387
sudo	passwd
i tried putting sudo ufw enable as one of the startup applications but it asks for the sudo passwd every time i log on and i m guessing it does not protect anyone else who logs on my computer

76427
stdout	stderr
is there a way to attach to it s stdout stderr in order to see the output of the application

76435
mouse	keyboard
i found this for the keyboard but cannot find anything for mouse - i will keep looking

76447
filesystems	ntfs
the second option is not doable with chmod on fat32 or ntfs filesystems

76448
mouse	keyboard
this should keep the monitor up and lock the keyboard and mouse until you type in your password

76495
versioning	upgrade
upgrade ubuntu to versioning 9.10

76553
folder	directory
defining a documents library whether it contains only 1 directory or more does not change the default location for the documents folder

ubuntu	linux
is there an equivalent to this for linux users specifically ubuntu

76658
rss	feed
i found out that you could also ues iphoto to download images from a rss feed

76660
disk	ram
it s a 386 with 640kb + 1mb of ram a floppy disk drive and a serial port

76697
ubuntu	linux
or maybe there is a windows 95 cd driver emulation for ubuntu somewhere that would allow me to read the cd directly from linux

76709
itunes	iphoto
the only option i can find in itunes is to sync them from iphoto

76762
photoshop	paint.net
typical image editing software like paint.net or photoshop is too slow you have to open the image file select a rectangle manually crop save close ..

76767
umask	mount	filesystems	ntfs
as an example of such command to mount the ntfs partition here under the mnt windows with readonly -r and umask to control permissions the filesystems is specified using the -t switch

admuncher shareware blocks ads in all browsers including internet explorer firefox opera google-chrome safari flock netscape maxthon and avant browser and thus speeds up page loading and saves bandwidth thanks to the missing ads and pop up windows

76775
vim	emacs
open the etc passwd file using vim nano emacs joe whatever editor rocks your boat and look for the id you have just created ie

76822
mouse	keyboard
issues to resolve are that you will require a two button mouse or keyboard with a right click equivalent the latter being my solution to get to the menus

76996
opera	safari
please verify you can wget google.com just fine and that either safari or opera or both work just fine

76996
versioning	upgrade
i ll guess you were running an older versioning of firefox previous to the upgrade

77005
kde	gnome
conky afaik does require a bit of tweaking to get it to play nice in gnome kde because of they way they want to manage your desktop but in leaner wm s it s a zero config application

77117
post	get
if i m remembering correctly pressing f12 during post on a dell computer will get you into the bios

77133
mouse	keyboard
there seems to be a lot of software to control or emulate mouse input through the keyboard but what about the opposite

77138
mouse	keyboard
if however you re looking to essentially replace the whole keyboard with one mouse well this may not be the answer you need

77155
bluetooth	usb
i ve heard that there are certain bluetooth dongles that act as a regular input device just as if you ve connected a regular usb keyboard instead of just forwarding the bluetooth signal so to speak

77165
ethernet	wireless
after you have done this just plug one rj45 ethernet cable in to your current router and then it should provide wireless access to the network

77167
ubuntu	linux
since someone is bound to ask the distro is ubuntu netbook remix 9.10 and it uses grub2 version 1.97 but i fail to see how that makes any difference since it can t even load the generic linux kernel

77169
kde	gnome
there is two things that comes to my mind on this...if you are talking about in x kde gnome then you have to get out of it ctrl+alt+backspace unless the system is set up to use kdm or gdm the login screen for kde gnome respectively

77171
bluetooth	usb
are you asking about usb bluetooth adapters

77171
mouse	keyboard

vmware	virtualbox
3 purchase vmware fusion instead of virtualbox

77413
udp	tcp
just port foward 3389 tcp and udp to the computer that has the remote desktop enabled

77415
vmware	virtualbox
imo it s a much better solution for doing development than using vmware or virtualbox on a mac

77426
vmware	bootcamp
however if you want to put your vmware image contents on it s own partition this is only supported by fusion with a bootcamp installation

77524
vmware	virtualbox
at a glance it looked like virtualpc and virtualbox were lacking several of vmware workstation s more advanced features although virtualbox does look like a better fit than vmware server for what i m currently doing.

77588
mouse	keyboard
if you have multiple monitors you can run different x servers for each monitor in linux and manually specify the keyboard mouse devices which each server uses

77602
imagemagick	mogrify
try convert or mogrify using imagemagick

77649
folder	directory
failing this take a look at httrack if you type the website address it should be able to download everything to a local folder and keep the directory structure the same as on your host

77650
mouse	keyboard
select the virtual machine so you can move inside it then press the release key so the virtual machine software still has focus but your keyboard mouse is not captured then press the alt + print screen combination and it should capture a screen shot on the host

77683
vpn	lan
rpc is how outlook connects to exchange on the lan or vpn you always hide this behind the firewall

77711

vim	emacs

77804
google-chrome	firefox
this problem occurs in firefox ie and google-chrome

77812
gif	png
edit it to only show the command box and save it to png gif will lead to paint dithering the classic grey text and jpeg would create artefacts around your text

77827
opera	firefox
change the default homepage for internet explorer firefox and opera

77827
opera	firefox
proxy settings for internet explorer firefox and opera

77850
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	ubuntu	linux
gnu screen screen behaves differently on os x 10.5 leopard and 10.6 snow leopard compared to linux at least ubuntu red hat and gentoo and os x 10.4 tiger

77896
x86	64bit
windows has never supported a x86 32-bit to a x64 64bit upgrade in any operating system

77902
filesystems	ntfs
you can try using the badblocks utility on the raw device which houses your ntfs drive since it works on the device and is not filesystems dependent

77940
firefox	safari
i ve recently switched from firefox to safari and basically like the change

77954
google-chrome	firefox
is there anything - another browser google-chrome extension firefox extension plugin anything - that can help me be more productive with my url bar like that

78001
afp	smb	ftp	smb
it does smb afp ftp http https apple bonjour and bittorrent

78009

em64t and amd64 are specific implementations of the x86-64 instruction set originally specified by amd as a 64bit extension to the x86 instruction set

78061
folder	directory
use cut copy paste shortcut keys ctrl-c ctrl-x ctrl-v to move and copy files and folder between directory

im not asking for nvidia vs ati thread just the main diferences between the gpu families

78132
ethernet	wireless
enter device manager and locate your ethernet or wireless card

78167
rss	feed
your best bet is to find a way to use the content query web part publishing feature required - it has an option to publish an rss feed of its query results

78176
folder	directory
i ve revealed the hardrives directory structure through terminal and when i get a new package to install after it has been mounted not only do i see the .app file and application folder but i also see other files such as a background folder being if the package had a nice backround to it and some other files

78227
mouse	keyboard
i have a razer deathadder mouse and a stock dell keyboard plugged into my system

78232
vim	emacs
i am looking to switch to emacs from vim and one thing that is keeping me away is that emacs opens up a separate window of its own when run under x

78234
vim	emacs
unlike vim emacs generally has a longer startup time and anyway tends to be running all the time with multiple open buffers

78269
post	get
this is a know issue there is a bug in mdnsresponder there are plenty of post in discussions.apple.com some others already opened a bug in apple we don t know if they will deliver it in 10.6.3 as this bug is not massive but depends on the isp s dns server even if you set the opendns servers it will not change the situation as a second bug in mdnsresponder mess up with the order of dns servers it has in list and even if you force it to use the opendns it will get the one offered by the default gateway which is the one provided by your isp which is the one matching with the first bug

78315
ubuntu	linux
i didn t think ubuntu could use an sd card in sd mode--i thought it was using the older mmc mode because linux can t abide by the sd consortium s restrictions on sd mode

78366
disk	ram
i load up my 20mb jpeg the program reads the entire image and the os keeps that in ram for you all working memory looks the same to the program the os decides if it goes to the page swap file on disk or ram

78368
disk	ram
on the other hand if you have a fast cpu but a small amount of ram processing of the numbers will be fast but from time to time the machine will need to drag them from disk and put them back again to make room for more which is many times slower than taking them from ram

78415
rss	feed
some podcasts don t provide an rss feed for downloading the episodes but only a itms link for itunes

78431
pop-up	dialog
a dialog pop-up and says

78481
folder	directory
navigate to the directory library preferences systemconfiguration note that this is the library at the root of the drive not in your user folder

78495
daemons	systemd
8 - systemd administration commands and daemons

78606
rar	zip
archive files eg zip rar 7z exe ace etc. however should be pretty simple they have a built-in corruption detection facility

78608
x86	64bit
as for seeing which one is x64 and which one is x86 i think that grmcprfrer_es_dvd is x86 32-bit and grc1culxfrer_es_dvd is x64 64bit but you can confirm by opening the iso in winrar or another extraction program and take a look at autorun.inf - the top line of the x64 disk should be -

78613
rar	zip
the program for scanning archive files on a disk and i presume you mean the zip rar 7z exe ace and the likes is called a script

78620
chm	rtf
fbreader supports txt html palmdoc rtf ms word chm ztxt oeb fb2 openreader

78632
bibtex	latex
i use it with bibtex latex myself

78647
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	linux
choose one of the major linux distributions such as ubuntu redhat or fedora

78651
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu should do you fine for the linux side of things

78656
opensuse	linux
my personal choice for linux c c++ is opensuse netbeans

78677
disk	ram
my machine has an amd athlon 64 3000+ cpu not dual core 2gb of ram an nvidia geforce 7600-something and 500gb disk space

78683
filesystems	ntfs
your best bet would be ntfs as it s rather painful to install drivers under windows for other filesystems

78683
filesystems	ntfs
now linux and osx can write on ntfs filesystems

78689
udp	tcp
i like to to able to monitor and block any linux program from making in out tcp udp connections on per application base

78776
tunnel	lan
so you don t tunnel your local lan traffic and everything else goes out the tunnel

78826
truecrypt	umount
umount the truecrypt volume

78864
ubuntu	linux
however i m running ubuntu linux 9.10 i am curious to know if there is a solution not using virtual machines that will mimic these effects on linux thanks

78868
filesystems	ntfs
although linux filesystems don t suffer from fragmentation as dramatically as ntfs they do fragment over time

78880
pull	push
in order to not get the error permission denied publickey when trying to push to or pull from github i have to issue the command ssh-add github_id_rsa

78976
ethernet	wireless
i had a time when i used an adsl modem in bridged mode so that a wireless router next to it became the internet gateway and prior to selecting bridged mode it pretty much stated that the device would become invisible to the network and would essentially be an adsl - ethernet converting paperweight

78976
put	get
basically you have a choice of seeing what speed the connection is and put up with a useless extra gateway or you just accept that the speed is what it will be and get on with making use of it

79002
robocopy	xcopy
in the command prompt you will be using robocopy not xcopy

79018
beyondcompare	winmerge
since your backup source is relatively small you could use a tool like beyondcompare or winmerge free to compare the directories and any differences in the files

79023
bluetooth	usb
also mimo makes a usb touch screen monitor that could in theory be connected to a wireless usb or bluetooth extender

79026
width	height
i tried playing around with the width and height under properties layout but it seems to resize the window itself the borders without resizing the textarea inside the window text does not have more room but the window is bigger

79043
centos	linux
also it has to work on red hat enterprise linux 5.3 or centos 5.3 for the x86_64 architecture

79043
debian	centos
i found a precompiled version for debian x86_64 but it doesn t work on centos

79073
ubuntu	linux
set up ubuntu today to sandbox linux a bit and see what it s about as well as to have it available to test out my web designs in a linux environment

79134
kde	gnome
i use awesome as my window manager but gnome and kde handle xrandr as well if not better

79137
kde	gnome
but then again i don t use gnome or kde

79141
range	minimum
the psu one has to get range between 100 150 â minimum to keep the noise down

79172
antialiasing	transparent
antialiasing onto a white background where it should be transparent

79174
voip	sip
1 ethernet port so i can make sip voip calls

79322
mouse	keyboard
we control the media pc with a wireless mouse keyboard which is pretty sweet

79322
mouse	keyboard
but it would be even sweeter if we could control the media pc from one of our laptops the laptops media pc other computers are all running on the same lan instead of using the wireless keyboard mouse

79323
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard between multiple

79323
mouse	keyboard
not only can you share mouse and keyboard but also the clipboard to copy paste a youtube url

79325
ethernet	wireless
ethernet or wireless network

79325
demo	shareware
maxivista is shareware so you can try the demo before considering a purchase

79357
mouse	keyboard
edit another option if you have a second machine with a monitor is to share your mouse and keyboard from your main computer with either teleport or synergy

79362
folder	directory
now copy all the music to a folder under your ubuntu home directory called music which we will create for example

79414
versioning	upgrade
in the end i just upgrade my release and used that pre-packaged versioning

79418
put	get
the packaged version may not put things in the same places as the make install defaults so there s no guarantee that the old version files would get overwritten by the newer files

79436
post	get
post would pass but after the little windows logo all i would get was a black screen

79452
put	get
that being said i sometimes have problems and by far my favourite way of file recovery if a disk is still readable is to just get out the cd put it in a working windows computer and use either recuva for the light accidental deletion job or r-studio for anything half serious as i have not seen anything better

79469
voip	sip
you just need voip based phones that can either use your router and directly link to a third party sip provider or roll out your own pbx such as trixbox however that would require a computer to be on 24x7

79489
hide	show
to hide or show the recycle bin icon using folder options follow these steps

79493
google-chrome	firefox
slow is too much relative thing but looks like that gif animation is slower in firefox than in google-chrome and even ie 8

79523
hash	md5
i add a textfile containing md5 hash of all files on the disc

79523
hash	md5
in a cygwin terminal find all files in the set to be burned calculate an md5 hash for each and store it into the file

79555
wan	lan
so if your wan is on eth0 your lan on eth1 you need another nic to be eth2

79605
ubuntu	debian
maybe the tutorial how to compile rtorrent from svn in ubuntu 9.10 karmic koala debian 5 lenny with magnet link support will help you

79606
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r user group . folder

79609
chown	chmod
if this is the case chown and chmod won t help -- you ll need to fix the filesystem eg with fsck before you ll be able to remount the partition normally

79616
rss	feed
this will copy the url to the rss feed of the podcast into your clipboard

79628
voip	sip
i want to make it connect to a sip gateway lancom 1823 voip through internet both sides use an adsl connection

79651
put	get
or you can put newgrp web or whatever the group name is in your .bashrc somewhere near the end of the file to get logged into the web group each time you login -- without changing your user s primary group

79653
kde	gnome
if you re talking about a full-blown gnome kde desktop upgrading won t help you and may be very detrimental

79678
xfce	gnome
i want to copy all output that is currently in an xfce or gnome terminal session and save to a file for further analysis

79683
folder	directory
the tilde signifies your home directory so the file output.txt will be under your home folder containing the output of the command

79688
installation	upgrade
its not due to an upgrade or new installation since i haven t done either in a very long time

79690
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
is it also slow in ie we know it s not in google-chrome how about safari opera because maybe the sandbox in google-chrome is hiding it from something on your system

79707
vmware	virtualbox
apart from virtualbox vmware also works well

79714
udp	tcp
memorize this command t tcp u udp n numerical a all p processes

79744
folder	directory
live sync now fails to sync that folder as it has a limit to the number of files in the directory

79809
vmware	esx
unless that have reduced the functionality recently you can use the converter to create a vm on a vmware server instance no infrastructure esx esxi ... as i have done this previously creating a vm on one of our test dev vm host machines from an old laptop that was about to be rebuilt

79842
vmware	virtualbox
i used vmware in my discussion simpley as that s what i use however virtualbox is an open source alternative that will allow you to do the same

79863
filesystems	fat
for fat filesystems read write availability is governed by the mount options

79882
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
if nothing appears make sure the filesystems used is supported that is is fat unless you add support for ntfs or whatever

79882
filesystems	fat
and by the way if you want to mount manually use solaris device names eg dev dsk c9t0d0p0 1 not linux ones eg sdb1 and fat filesystems type is pcfs not vfat

79907
mouse	keyboard
you might want to look at your keyboard or mouse more likely mouse

79914
umask	sudo
on older versions of os x 10.5 and below sudo used the umask of the root user which was 0022

79914
umask	sudo	sudoers	umask
i discovered the umask option for sudo and in etc sudoers i added the following line

79914
umask	sudo
however this did not function as desired because the real umask used by sudo is the union of the user mask with this default mask

79914
umask	sudo
in order to override the behaviour of sudo s umask and use the default directly not the union of the user and default sudo mask one can add the following

79990
ubuntu	linux
i have a ubuntu machine running nagios on the network already so the solution could be run from a windows or linux environment

80105
post	put
start a blogger blog put up a few post with an extra gmail address in the text

80145
folder	directory
if you only want it to look in the folder starting with a and no directory in those a folder use maxdepth

80155
antivirus	mcafee
in my experience mcafee antivirus causes an insane performance hit every time you touch a file but some other antivirus apps such as ca and avast don t seem to have as severe a performance hit even with on-access scanning enabled

80161
kde	kubuntu
i have one computer running kubuntu 8.04 and one running mepis and i m thinking mepis using kde 3.5 is nicer

80251
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	debian
how can i know this is ubuntu debian fedora or redhat

80260
ubuntu	debian
it so happens i m running ubuntu which is a debian derivative

80281
vim	emacs
both vim and emacs fit that bill and are a nice way to go for cross-platform being available on nearly every nix install

80281
vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate
if you just want to hack out text and don t care to learn emacs or vim there are a bunch of options textmate is a joy on the mac with e-text editor acting similar on windows

80281
notepad++	sublimetext
also for windows there s notepad++ notepad 2 both being scintilla based text editors and sublimetext

80281
notepad++	scite	notepad++	sublimetext	sublimetext	scite
on windows between scite notepad++ and notepad2 i prefer notepad++ but sublimetext is finding its way into my arsenal

80304
filesystems	ntfs
how to change the traditional filesystems of a usb flashdrive fat32 into ntfs or other filesystems

80305
filesystems	ntfs
q how do i format a usb flash drive to ntfs filesystems

80305
filesystems	ntfs
choose ntfs in the filesystems dropdown box

80348
ubuntu	opensuse
opensuse is your best bet for the best looking best integrated but it s not as polished as ubuntu

80414
temp	tmp
from file browser i can open files from samba with open office but from krusader it makes a local copy in tmp and open that temp file instead of original file

80415
ssl	https
certificates for websites using https and ssl rely heavily on dns to work since that s one of the major checks that help prevent phishing

80467
ubuntu	centos
note i am experiencing the problem on a work machine which needs to run centos so switching to ubuntu which i normally run at home can not be considered

80522
width	height
another issue i can handle the width and depth of a large laptop but both of the machines you mentioned -- and the acer which is the largest of the bunch by height -- are 0.8 greater in height than an apple macbook pro 17 0.98 6.6lbs

80526
ati	nvidia
ati doesn t play as well with linux as nvidia does

80530
rss	feed
one way to check for deals on all sites though is to use rss feed

80543
afp	smb
for the time being i have verified that it is an smb problem as i installed a trial version of extremez-ip on my windows system which lets you share your windows 7 folders using afp

80544
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse work but i can t install the supplied intellitype pro software to make use of the media keys assign favourite programs to run

80567

download mouse and keyboard software

80640
iwork	iphoto
aperture is geared towards a raw workflow and still syncs with iwork and iphone but it is laking some iphoto features such as faces

80643
google-chrome	firefox
i we don t really care much for ie and i d like to add google-chrome and firefox for her to let her choose her own browser

however windows 7 should find the driver if you point to the folder you have backed up it will go through all sub directory or get the latest 32-bit version here

81269
google-chrome	firefox

81348
rar	zip
i have noticed that this happens with files also but only of specific file types - exe zip rar etc

81350
vbscript	jscript
instead internet explorer supports jscript and vbscript

i push and pull from what i consider a central repo

81579
pull	push
add the remote repo as the origin so push pull will act upon that repo

opera is easier on the scarce system resources than firefox and the theme is nicer the wood theme in foxy has some readability issues

beyond that you would have to start digging into the details of fat filesystems layout

82092
folder	directory
in your documents directory normally c users your_username_here documents for your user account create a windowspowershell folder named exactly like that if one does not already exist

82119
disk	ram
you can in fact define swap areas in files on most unix-a-like oss if you want to and don t mind the reduced efficiency introduced by working through the filesystem layer when pages need to be moved between ram and disk but very few people do because it isn t the default and there is very little if anything to gain by it in most if not all common use cases

82153
vmware	virtualbox
can i install a virtual machine host software such as virtualbox or vmware on the windows home server machine

82171

so my question is is it possible to use grub4dos or standard grub or any other bootloaders to boot a raw disk image of windows xp the filesystems is ntfs which is created by dd

82665
ati	nvidia
there will be no problems in using an ati graphics card on an nvidia chipset motherboard or vice-versa

82665
ati	nvidia
just be sure that prior to installing the ati card you boot into windows in safe mode remove the existing nvidia drivers and then install the ati drivers post installing the hardware to ensure no driver conflicts crop up

82671
windows	winpe
ntldr is used to boot a full windows installation as well as winpe 1.0 used with xp over pxe so it includes this functionality

82711

one way would be to get an lcd with a media card reader and just put those pictures on there

for instance if you previously used the do this automatically for files like this from now on checkbox to have thunderbird always open .doc attachments with word you can undo that file-handling association by clicking on the doc file type and clicking the remove action button

83062
kde	gnome
also chrome chromium makes use of xdg scripts so you can try configuring the proxy server in gnome kde and set up xdg scripts to use settings of the desktop environment

83064
kde	gnome
if you don t use either kde or gnome you could try browsing gconf chrome uses it to store it s settings

83073
filesystems	ntfs
this compact and portable windows application supports ntfs and fat32 filesystems

83079
mp3	aiff
are there any windows command line tools for converting mp3 files to aiff the standard itunes format and back

83090
min	max
you can also see about moving your page file to your secondary partition and giving it a fixed size max and min set the same

83096
mp3	aiff
you could use it to convert aiff to mp3 but i don t believe it will write aiff

83100
kde	gnome
if you find that you re a gnome desktop user we a thing for some kde applications and the occasional fling with vim no one is going to stop you

83113
ubuntu	opensuse
apart from ubuntu which is one of the obvious choices i would suggest glancing at xubuntu which is its small brother or opensuse as one of the alternatives

83157
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux
if you re new to linux you ll probably want to go with one of the big four distros ubuntu fedora opensuse or mandriva

83157
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
as you re interested in media you may also like to look at linux mint which basically respins ubuntu to make it work a bit nicer with multimedia out of the box

83157
kde	gnome
the big two are gnome and kde

83165
google-chrome	safari
today i was using and safari and google-chrome both crashed when i tried to upload photos of the dents in my car

when i turn my machine on it goes through the post screen for about 35 sec and then goes into a screen i never seen before and the message i get is searching for array.

83248

imho you will be happier if you sold this for what ever you can get at a garage sale or craigslist and just put the money toward the new laptop

83298
versioning	upgrade
if your media is not limited to a specific versioning you could install the lowest versioning onto a nominated partition then upgrade that copy of win 7 with your license key

83298
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
see paul thurrots win super site for details on the clean install upgrade and my digital life for information on how to make your installation media capable of installing any versioning on win 7

83307

if you buy the 29.99 student upgrade you can do either an upgrade installation if your machine was running vista or you can do a clean install if your machine is running xp

83308
pop-up	dialog
every time i close the lid on my macbook pro running 10.6.2 and open it again mail cal and or adium will pop-up the keychain unlock dialog

83313
filesystems	hfs+
the filesystems was intact but the hfs+ partition on the external drive was mistakenly flagged as microsoft basic data instead of apple_hfs

83378
vmware	virtualbox
you have two options for a decent experience vmware or virtualbox

83393
ubuntu	linux
i too have experienced strange problems with the hard drive after having installed suse or ubuntu linux on them

83397
disk	ram
you can reclaim the disk space you partitioned for linux and all you ll really end up using is more cpu ram but these days those aren t too expensive

83433
mouse	keyboard
it happened today twice - the mouse and keyboard stopped responding and i had to re-boot

filesystems	fat
is it true that in fat filesystems the maximum number of files per filesystems equals the number of entries in the fat table

83494
filesystems	ntfs
other filesystems have similar limits ext2 3 has a 32 000 entry limit without certain tweaks some do not or effectively do not ntfs allows 4 000 000 000

83494
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
you will hit performance issues on some filesystems long before you hit the limit of entries per directory as some search directories linearly fat do ext2 does ext3 does unless you specific indexed directories ext4 and ntfs do indexed directories by default iirc

83495
firefox	safari
this disables touch gestures in safari firefox and mail.app

83539
post	get
i ll update this question or post an answer if appropriate if i get feedback from there

83555
mouse	keyboard
is there a keyboard shortcut that allows me to switch to the desktop background and hence i can close the apps to regain my mouse focus

83577
put	get
why not just move the logic board from the spare drive and put it on the dead drive and see if you can get it to spin up

83625
uninstall	upgrade
the ati drivers for the motherboard and video have never upgrade themselves cleanly - i always have to do a command-line uninstall and new install

83669
vmware	virtualbox
just like livinloud said using windows with a virtualization software like virtualbox vmware server etc

83690
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
the debian ubuntu package for this is moonlight-plugin-mozilla so it should be the same on linux mint

83691
emacs	textmate
have the new window create a new emacs process not just a new buffer so that i can manage and navigate multiple projects similar to how textmate does it using one emacs process for each project

83692
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
firefox opera and google-chrome all have this enabled by default but safari doesn t seem to have this ability

83696
vmware	virtualbox
i don t want to use any vmware virtualbox etc

sudo	passwd
note that you have to create a second user to do that have the proper rights to run sudo and enter your passwd every time you run pidgin like that which can be a little annoying too

83767
filesystems	ntfs
fat32 and ntfs are not compatible filesystems

83767
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
upgrading the filesystems from fat 32 to ntfs in the xp system will not change how the system works and will actually give you better performance

83770
mouse	keyboard
when i click the shortcuts keyboard buttons my computer freezes i can move the mouse but i can t make things work

83784
ready	each
it wouldn t be so bad except that the cursor moves back to the center of the laptop screen with each flicker so i can t really do anything until the machine decides it s ready to calm down

83784
versioning	upgrade
all i can suggest is if you re running an older versioning of windows upgrade to 7 or later

83787
arp	icmp
if the arp cache shows something then the firewall is blocking the icmp ping

83804
disk	ram
i booted from the dvd and ran a few tests noticed that hd and ram are being detected also did a repair on the disk through disk utility still getting same error

83814
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade versioning of windows 7 will allow you to perform a clean install however you will need to have a previously installed versioning of windows xp or windows vista in order to validate the upgrade install and activate the upgrade product key

83832
tunnel	vpn
potentially you could use a vpn or ssh tunnel to some remote location

83929
gif	bmp
standard picture types bmp jpg gif

83934
disk	ram
windows 7 home premium 32 bit takes 9 gb of disk space installed but you will typically need a few gb for the pagefile depending on how much ram you have

83947
mouse	keyboard
in keyboard and mouse you can then assign keyboard shortcuts based on the location names as they are found under apple menu -- location

83956
rss	feed
also if you are working with the mouse a lot say web browsing and you want to quickly check an rss feed the weather a webcam any kind of real-time gadget you might have on the desktop it is a really easy spot to hit slide all the way down and to the right

google has done a lot of statistical analysis of consumer disks and have noted several trends the most important to your question is that you will get about a 10 chance of failure in the first 3 months if you put your disk in high-utilization stress test

84025
ubuntu	debian
you could also look at libfaketime which is packaged in ubuntu debian

84043
titlebar	window
one of the problems you encounter with this setup is the occasional window opening underneath the task bar completely obscuring the titlebar such that you can t move it or click its buttons

84048
daemons	systemd
the ntpdate package isn t a daemons and should not be updating your systemd time automatically it should run once at boot and no more

84048
ubuntu	debian
datefudge available in debian ubuntu repositories and other places

84060
lvm	mdadm
i ve also seen mdadm used together with lvm

84115
ubuntu	linuxmint
i m running linuxmint ubuntu derivative with twinview enabled

84132
ubuntu	linux
i am completely new to linux so i would like to ask how to add these libraries to my ubuntu linux

84148
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
linux mint is an ubuntu derivative so you should be able to use synaptic to search if the program you re trying to install is already packaged for it

84178
daemons	launchd
you can do this by adding the key strictunicastordering and setting it to true to mdnsresponder s launchd daemons plist and reload it as necessary

84197
windows	winpe
the pe-xp part of that name makes me think of winpe such as found on windows boot recovery cds

84201
ati	nvidia
video drivers often give improvements on nvidia and ati cards they are always trying to add new optimizations

84206
versioning	upgrade
windows upgrade - upgrade a single copy of windows to the latest versioning

84265
filesystems	xfs
xfs is not a data journaling filesystems such as ext3 and ext4 it is a meta-data journaling filesystems

84266
folder	directory
this creates a new folder repository you can name it however you want and downloads all the stuff in path to directory to checkout to it

84289
ubuntu	linux
certain linux distributions ubuntu and mandriva that i know of have the proper keyboard mapping for me run them inside vmware fusion without having to do any special keyboard configuration with my portuguese keyboard

84300
filesystems	xfs
would using a filesystems like xfs give noticeably better results

84367
rss	feed
so there s no hidden stored version of the rss podcast feed and files in itunes

84392
gentoo	debian
i m looking to install debian and gentoo alongside mac os x on a intel macbook

84392
gentoo	debian	gentoo	linux	debian	linux
debian will be for using linux and gentoo for toying around

84396
freebsd	opensolaris	freebsd	linux
some choices are linux freebsd or opensolaris

84414
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox is free and quite good but in the same situation i chose to use vmware fusion as their web site has many appliances - prebuilt virtual machines with linux and other oss which makes installation very quick

84424
mouse	keyboard
however you might be able to use input director to set up keyboard mouse sharing and share the mouse or stylus on your tablet to your desktop with mirror mode enabled

84547
ubuntu	linux
i also use windows and linux xubuntu and ubuntu for desktop applications so either of those would be great too

84753

suddenly that usb port doesn t detect the mouse and the keyboard even with the light of the hub is on and the only solution that i found is restarting the laptop

84753
mouse	keyboard
but just some minutes and the keyboard and mouse goes undetected again.

84769

since the problem is occurring for two different devices i think it s less likely a hardware failure on the mouse or keyboard

disk	ram
so if you want something off the disk you instruct the disk to store it in ram for you and then go and do something else

84925
cpu	affinity	disk	ram
then you re going to need to put some kind of affinity algorithm into the os which maps processes to cpu ram sets based on what disk they re using

84928
ubuntu	linux
unfortunately using a more recent version of fedora or even another linux distribution altogether isn t an option becuase of outside constraints - which is annoying since i know for a fact ubuntu works fine on this setup

google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome certainly uses the system dns settings and not anything specific to itself furthermore its network connectivity preferences makes use of the system preferences on windows at any rate i haven t checked how this is handled on the recent mac release unlike firefox which has it s own connectivity preferences stack but it will still have to make use of the underlying dns and ip-settings of the machine there is no way for it to find any alternatives unless you set them at the shared system level

kde is a huge unified project which has quite a different approach from the gnome project

88261
kde	gnome
xubuntu was initially created for old machines that couldn t run gnome or kde properly

88261
xfce	gnome
xfce uses gtk just like gnome and quite a few programs from xubuntu are actually the same as in ubuntu or sometimes lightweight versions of them

88261
kde	gnome
as i said kde is generally a more unified environment so it also pulls more dependencies between programs which means installing a kde program in a gnome environment might make it feel quite heavy when all the kde libraries load for just one program while loading a gnome program such as gimp inside kde won t be so heavy since gtk programs don t interact as much as kde programs do

88261
kde	gnome
i run kde and i don t care to load gtk programs when i really need but gnome users often complain that kde programs slow down their desktop experience

88278
pull	push
i can connect to my pc as media server but that seems more pull than push unless i am missing something

88297
folder	directory
i could just compress the directory as a .zip file w a password which i think would just look like a compressed folder w a password but i d like something with less overhead none of the decompression etc.

ethernet	wireless
i figure since it s happening with both wireless and the ethernet conroller it has something more to do with the the os dirver configuration

88624
move	drag
here s a catch if you start a new line remove those markers from the ruler click and hold your mouse on one of them drag it down until the mark becomes gray release your mouse and it will disappear otherwise next time you hit the tab key your cursor will move to the middle of the page

88628
ethernet	wireless
i figure since it s happening with both wireless and the ethernet conroller it has something more to do with the the os dirver configuration

88748
folder	directory
the only way that i know of would be to simply look in the exclusions list in settings and see if you can just include that one file if not possibly exclude the whole directory if you have nothing critical in there do not use it as a staging folder for other activities

88772
switching	screens
switching back to the gdm screens using alt-f7

i m not sure about usb and bluetooth but if your computer doesn t have a network adapter there are plenty usb and pci ones

88808
switching	screens
uncheck use the welcome screens and use fast user switching

using a live linux cd like ubuntu you should be able to access any files and folders on your system assuming that they haven t been overwritten

88928
disk	ram
what i find weird about this is that it s not entering sleep until the battery is completely depleted but it simply shuts down and when i connect it to mains it restores from the safe sleep loads ram from disk

88928
disk	ram
my previous macbooks went to sleep a while after the battery warning keeping the ram alive for a few hours before the battery gets completely empty then shutting down deep sleep suspend to disk

88928
disk	ram
during that time you could reconnect the power supply and the macbook resumed from ram instead of disk

rss	feed
thanks to all what i am after is a general xml rss feed that offers versioning info as a general information issue definitely nothing that scans our boxes super tight security and definitely nothing windows related

88985
rss	feed
more info we use a lot of open source packages on our slackware servers and having an xml rss feed that we could parse would allow us to write notification routines that alert us to version changes

88995

you can get rss feed from versiontracker.com keeping you informed about new releases

vmware	virtualbox
the easiest way to do this is to use some virtual machine software such as virtualbox or vmware and run dos in it

89218
bluetooth	usb
as from experience you can only do it through one connection and usb takes dominance over bluetooth connection

89224
vmware	virtualbox
although i assume it only supports 16-bit dos applications i can t find a definitive answer so setting up a vmware virtualbox or virtualpc dos installation as david suggested might be the easiest and most surefire way to test it

89224
16-bit	64bit
windows 64bit editions do not include the 16-bit compatibility layer so i suppose if all else fails you can assume that your program is either corrupt or 16-bit if it doesn t run on a 64bit windows installation

89232
hash	md5
md5 context menu is a freeware shell extension for windows which displays the md5 hash sum of the selected file

89233
vmware	virtualbox
if you own multiple windows licenses you can set up a vmware virtualbox virtualpc virtual machine for each user

89233
disk	ram
the main drawback to using this solution instead of windows server is that you ll have to invest a little more in hardware more ram more faster disk and possibly a faster cpu to handle the extra overhead of running several complete windows instances on one machine and balance out the resource contention

89233
tunnel	vpn
they could all use ssh tunnel to login securely forward the x sessions to their workstations possibly eliminating the need for a separate vpn depending on the server s network setup

the only advantage i can see over other approaches is that in zsh at least and i think bash you can use command completion to see all your servers to connect to

disclaimer you might need to do some shell customization to get that working but i believe it will work by default in zsh and probably in bash as well.

i ve been using the 64bit version of windows 7 since the ctp and have run into a few problems with applications that get installed in the c program files x86 folder

89540
x86	64bit
if indeed there is some benefit to having a separate folder for 64bit apps it seems like the more sensible default would have been to use c program files for x86 apps and create a new c program files x64 folder for the new 64bit apps

89540

edit regarding environment variables using only default english values of variables for simplicity. on a 64bit machine programfiles will be c program files while the brand new variable programfiles x86 will be c program files x86

ubuntu has good ntfs support and linux handles a lot more wonky-characters-in-filenames than windows

90326
filesystems	ntfs
the reason that such files can be created is that windows has support for posix so ntfs was designed to be able to support all the features of posix filesystems

there are two main systems for unix software on os x macports and fink

92885
ubuntu	debian
fink is akin to and iirc based on the debian ubuntu apt system it delivers pre-compiled binaries

both will get gimp and all its dependencies installed for you - fink will be faster as it doesn t have to compile but macports gives you more control over what gets built

disk	ram
if the total size of the image s being edited are smaller than your available physical ram after photoshop is loaded there should be almost no disk activity

96076

for example libraries used by apple programs can be individually moved to a folder on your other partition following instructions on the internet itunes iphoto aperture

99412

is just a directory os x unix version of a folder just like users username desktop is so why not just store all of the data on the second partition and use a soft-link to the username .

99454
opera	firefox
the requests are extremely slow so loading any pages in firefox or konqueror doing package installations in kpackagemanager and other apps is really painful while for example opera doesnt have any problems and ping is normally fast as well for dns pings

on snow leopard you have to set safari to 32 bit mode or use firefox set to run under rosetta to successfully open fdf files in acrobat reader

spoofing	traffic
if you own the network you could use arp spoofing to trick your network into thinking that your pc is the internet gateway router modem then all traffic headed for the internet will go to your pc

99896
spoofing	traffic
so if you setup your pc to do traffic shaping as john t suggests but don t have access to the other pcs you could use arp spoofing to deceive the other machines on your network into using your traffic-shaping-pc whether they want to or not

if you do that in opera or firefox in windows it s lost iirc

100278
mouse	keyboard
reaching way back in my memory here but i seem to recall that older computers you could put either type of device in either port as both ports were always fully wired up if i can find my old ps 2 hardware book i ll verify it but i m pretty certain mouse and keyboard use different data lines

100278
mouse	keyboard
i seem to recall that at some point the manufacturers started cutting costs by not fully wiring both ports thereby making one keyboard only and one mouse only

100390
ubuntu	debian
alternatively you could use pdftoabw from the poppler-utils package in ubuntu and debian to convert the pdf directly to abiword format which might preserve formatting images better than copy-paste

100404
disk	ram
cd s are by definition non-rewritrable media which makes them unusable for os s installations live-cd s are working by creating a ram disk in which they can store temporary files and settings which are lost upon reboot

100405
disk	ram
there would have to be a heavy-weight conversion process to handle this as well as to set up the appropriate ram disk behavior that bongo described

100419

the command uname -a would show you your kernel info and help you determine if it s a 32-bit os x86 or 64bit x86_64

personnaly i prefer prevention and run an effective antivirus spyware application my personal recommendation the one i sing from the rooftops about is vipre from sunbelt software www.sunbeltsoftware.com

it would be really nice to just get sun engineers to put couple of thumpers in the basement but the cost is too much for most consumers

100691

if open source i would suggest postgresql since i believe it to be more robust than mysql

100873
cpu	processors
it is essentially the cpu of your video card cpu is central processing unit the brain or processors of a computer

100873
ati	nvidia
however companies like intel nvidia and ati are starting to push the envelope with more general-purpose gpu components making it easier than ever before for software developers to utilize extra processing power available on the video card to perform non-graphics operations

100874
cpu	processors
the cpu is the central processing unit probably your intel or amd processors

100882
cpu	processors
graphics card manufacturers realized that the gpu was now a really powerful piece of hardware that is often sitting idle for example when browsing the internet editing documents etc. so starting with the x1300 atiâ s cards included avivo which would allow the user to run video conversion software on the video cardâ s processors instead of doing it just on the slower cpu

100889
filesystems	ntfs
the device driver usually applies this restriction to the higher level and also reading whole sector with ntfs superblock is much more faster than reading the same sector several times implicitly because of a driver that translates byte range requests to sector requests so filesystems drivers are also performing read and write operations by sectors or any multiplies of sectors there exists a technology called dma -- direct memory access -- that allows reading and writing large bursts of sectors without using cpu time thus making disk access very fast

100900
ethernet	wireless
however i found out that my ethernet port is not working i have only used wireless so far and getting my computer repaired for 6 months is currently not an option..

100970
switching	screens
i suspect if you do this the display switching between monitors and i suspect perhaps your screens saver for suspend resume should no longer mess with your settings

101013
ati	nvidia
and one of the useful parts of each of these is one of the final pages of the reviews is the graphics card hierarchy chart which puts all the chipsets together and shows you which ones are similar in performance with nvidia and ati cards

101034
vmware	virtualbox
you can simulate multiple machines using vmware virtualbox virtualpc etc

101068
filesystems	xfs
if you find you re running out of space on your root partition you can extend the lv and the filesystems -- the ext3 4 xfs filesystems can even be grown while mounted lvextend then resize2fs or xfs_growfs

101072
notepad++	scite
it will tab-delimited so the columns won t always appear lined up but you can use a more feature-rich text editor such as scite or notepad++ to adjust the tab widths and optionally convert the tabs to spaces

101082
mouse	keyboard
it works well except i think it used to use a ps2 mouse keyboard and while in bios pre-boot the lights for the mouse keyboard is on and they are working but when it gets to the windows xp bootup it does not find the usb kb mouse

101118
mouse	keyboard
this will trick the os in thinking the usb keyboard and mouse are ps2

101127
mouse	keyboard
the computer now freezes completely a few seconds after reaching the desktop and is unresponsive to any keyboard or mouse command

101179
led	electronics
sounds like the monitor is taking the energy from somewhere else because i can not think that a capacitor can maintain the led on off and the electronics to detect that there is no signal for hours

i m using windows vista on a laptop and while my wireless card works fine and takes the address the wireless router s dhcp server gives it for some reason when i plug my built-in laptop nic port into the router via ethernet the ip address assigned to the nic is something like 169.254.xxx.xxx -- nothing close to the 192.168.0.xxx address range the dhcp server is supposed to be handing out

rar	zip
every time i download a rar zip file or any kind of archive from the internet i get this problem

101836
ubuntu	linux
if you re asking if linux software works on ubuntu the answer is yes as ubuntu is a flavor or distribution of linux

101836
ubuntu	linux
that + the libraries and tools is referred to as gnu linux and ubuntu is that + a set of programs pre-packaged to work well together which is called a linux distribution

101836

it s the set of commands to manipulate the files in the archives using rar unrar or unzip zip

101943
mouse	keyboard
the usb tops out at 480 mbits s but the reality is that you are doing very well if you get 48 mbytes s out of that interface and it may be competing with your slower mouse keyboard and other usb peripherals

101944
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs
out of the box the only commonly supported filesystems between host and guest would be fat32 and hfs but you can add ext2 ext3 ntfs support to mac os x

101958
ubuntu	linux
i have for years been using virtualbox under linux currently ubuntu 9.10 to run windows xp pro as a guest os

101992
awk	ksh
the target platform is the bsd4.3 environment in domain os so i have ksh awk sed and the usual bsd commands but not gnu versions

101992
unix	bsd
the native os attempts to imitate unix by providing a bsd4.3 environment with a reasonable set of bsd commands but there is a temptation to mix bsd and aegis commands like lvolfs as i ve done here

102010

to also show files and folders marked hidden and system you must also unmark hide protected operating system files

when i try to run windows 7 installed on bootcamp on vmware fusion 3 vmware fusion window just close and macos x tells me that vmware has crashed

102245
vmware	bootcamp
i am a little confused here - when you use vmware fusion you should not be using bootcamp at all - you should just start a new virtual machine and install windows as if it is a physical machine

102245
vmware	bootcamp
bootcamp is for actually using windows as a native operating system on your mac and has nothing to do with vmware fusion

102251
versioning	upgrade
if you can use synaptic all you ll have to do after you ve added the unstable repositories and after a apt-get update is to open synaptic search for the nvidia packages you want to upgrade right click on it and go to the preferencies there you ll find a versioning tab where you can force versioning

cpu	processors
in case you re using xp bootvis is a great utility to monitor the startup process cpu benchmarking is rather moot as the measures you re talking about hardly affect the computing power of your processors unless you tweak the services and or disable unnecessary unwanted background programs

102478
google-chrome	firefox
i use firefox and google-chrome hardly ever ie 8 so i apparently don t know about something

102480
google-chrome	firefox
compared with new releases of firefox and google-chrome ie6 is quite far behind

102507
ubuntu	linux
once that s fixed try booting off a linux livecd ubuntu knoppix and see what works

102536
ubuntu	linux
try booting the machine with a live linux cd that supports webcams perhaps ubuntu does that way you can rule out the os

102537
google-chrome	firefox
i m using portable google-chrome and portable firefox

102564
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to install the same add-on in google-chrome as in firefox

102564
google-chrome	firefox
do google-chrome add-ons have to be made especially for google-chrome or do all firefox add-ons work in google-chrome

102566
google-chrome	firefox
yes they have to be made especially for google-chrome and no firefox add-ons don t work in google-chrome

102566
google-chrome	firefox
and maybe it s possible to assemble the google-chrome extension and the firefox add-on in the same package

102566
google-chrome	firefox
i know that most of my firefox add-ons already have a similar google-chrome extension

102566
google-chrome	firefox
for instance lastpass has both a firefox add-on and a google-chrome extension

102601
ubuntu	linux
i m using virtualbox 3.1.2 r56127 on linux ubuntu 9.10 64-bit

102648
versioning	upgrade
i don t want to purchase windows 7 upgrade versioning only to find out that i need some piece of info that i don t have

102654
uninstall	upgrade
since you ll have to probably have to replace them anyway if you uninstall them first the upgrade will go quicker smoother

102657
google-chrome	firefox
i had to fix a strange error on a remote computer using windows xp the command ping www.google.com -t always has the replies but navigating to www.google.com on google-chrome mozilla firefox intenet explorer does not show up the webpage

102667
macbook	bootcamp
when windows 7 came out i bought a copy of home premium the retail box with both 32 and 64 bit versions to install via bootcamp on my macbook

102697
ethernet	wireless
i connected two laptops via ethernet cable to the router and got 15-20 mb s transferring a file over ftp which clearly indicated the problem is the wireless

102717
chown	chmod
there are 2 issues here chmod and chown

102717
chown	chmod
the main threat that chmod and chown defend against is protecting your files from other accounts on the system

102718
ethernet	wireless
i connected two laptops via ethernet cable to the router and got 15-20 mb s transferring a file over ftp which clearly indicated the problem is the wireless

102742
ethernet	wireless
how different ip addresses on ethernet adapter and wireless adapter are handled for internet data

102742
ethernet	wireless
i know these ip are translated in nat table but the whole process involving ethernet and wireless adapter together is not clear to me

102820
mouse	keyboard
this has the two standard ps 2 ports with a french keyboard and a mouse attached to them

102824
hid	keyboard
an ps 2 to usb adapter is a chip that emulates an ordinary usb keyboard on the computer side that it is handled by standard hid human interface device windows driver and a computer ps 2 controller really on it s keyboard side so ps 2 keyboard even cannot determine if it is plugged to usb adapter or real ps 2 controller

102858
octal	binary
octal is a natural way to describe them because you only need 1 octal digit to exactly represent any sequence of 3 binary digits

102858
hex	binary
this is similar to why hexadecimal is used in programming -- since 1 hex digit can represent 4 binary digits you only need 2 hex digits to describe 1 byte

102858
octal	binary
it boils down to the fact that 8 and 16 are powers of 2 so converting between octal and binary or hexadecimal and binary is really easy.

102858
octal	binary
so for example 110100100 in binary becomes 644 in octal and you know that the first octal digit is for the owner s permissions the second for the group s permissions and the third for everyone else

102860
octal	binary
notice that binary 110 is equal to octal 6 and binary 100 is equal to octal 4

102866
daemons	launchd
xinetd is a unix daemons that listens on one or more ports and launchd programs generally servers or other daemons when connections come in to those ports

102872
ethernet	wireless
are you connecting via wireless or ethernet

102872
ethernet	wireless
if there s no eth0 be sure your ethernet drivers are installed or wireless if you re not using any cables

102899
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
if i install a package manager such as macports fink or homebrew how does it affect the startup and running of my system

102900
folder	directory
in usr local bin i have a ln -s to usr local foo bash.script and in this latter script i want to know the current usr local foo directory so that i can run a secondary script from that folder

102911
google-chrome	firefox
my pc would not accept any microsoft updates.each time i try to go to microsoft download page it says page not available be it internet explorer firefox or google-chrome

102916
google-chrome	firefox
i think this behavior is not usual compared with other browsers like firefox or google-chrome or any other application for that matter

102919
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
google-chrome and older versions of firefox don t do this but ie8 office 10 apps firefox 3.6 and the current version of safari do

102932
width	height
if you press the lock button it will lock lock the aspect ratio when you paste either width or height

102944
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
i can mainly speak for macports but i m sure this applies to at least fink and likely homebrew as well

102944
fink	macports
i cannot see a way that installing macports or fink etc would inherently break your mono installation which installs itself in library frameworks with symlinks for executables in usr bin

102978
google-chrome	firefox
firefox uses xul xml ui language and javascript to for extensions however google-chrome uses internet standards such as jason html css and javascript

102978
google-chrome	firefox
development process are different guis in both use 2 different technologies although gui-control technology is same javascript at least today there is no firefox to google-chrome extension converter

103009
ubuntu	linux
i m relatively new to linux but i ve been messing around with a ubuntu vm to get more acclimated with it

103022
debian	linux
i am running debian linux without a gnome desktop

103050
ubuntu	linux
i have a nicely configured ubuntu 9.10 machine with crossover linux from codeweavers installed

103081
width	height
i believe you can with vista and above just run remote desktop with the width and height arguments instead of using span

103081
width	height
the width should be the combined width of your two monitors and the height should be the smallest monitor s height

103081
width	height
for example if you re using 2 monitors at 1680x1050 and 1024x768 use 2704 for the width and 768 for height

103120
ubuntu	linux
i connect to my linux box running ubuntu server 9.10 with plink and run urxvt

103148
disk	ram
if you gave up that 4gb ram to get ssd that means you most likely will have to go to disk for some stuff ms office 700mb major game 1gb

103148
disk	ram
it s 100 used for ram disk and immediately available for user use

103174
put	get
you could get a g access point and put it on the same range the n is on

103175
versioning	upgrade
i was also facing this problem i suggest to just upgrade it to 3.6 versioning

103175
versioning	upgrade
then i just click help check for updates and upgrade it to latest versioning 3.6

103195
ubuntu	debian
i ve bought an asus hd 4670 video card installed it on the pc and now the installed debian does not work while the ubuntu live cd refuses to run no matter if i set acpi apic on or off.

103319
google-chrome	firefox
long story short question is there an extension or setting to completely disable tabbing on firefox 3 google-chrome 4 and internet explorer 8 and have one window taskbar entry for each open page

103355

103406
kerberos	ntlm
simple fix is to disable kerberos in favor of ntlm

103406
kerberos	ntlm
setting kerberos and ntlm - kb 832769

103601
folder	directory
delete the folder open notepad and save the blank file as in the root directory of the drive in question now windows cannot create the folder

103618
rss	feed
i ve had a miserable experience with rss feed in outlook especially with my feed from the trilogy sites

103618
rss	feed
so why are rss feed so darned slow to update in outlook

103620
vim	emacs
what switched me over from nvi vim to nvi emacs as my respective change two words in a file spend hours editing a huge directory tree full of files editors was the integration of subprocesses

103620
hide	show
work the same in the minibuffer as in a buffer interactive updating display of potential completions via ido mode c-x b show me a list of buffers i could switch to typing a single letter .c hide all of the ones without a .c somewhere in the name c-s rotates the list enter picks the item on the front of the list

103621
rss	feed
so create a new send receive group and in its properties select the rss feed that you want to update at the higher rate

103621
rss	feed
the screen shot above shows a sample rss feed being prepared for updates every minute

103621
rss	feed
note jeff recommends updating no more than once every 15 minutes or you risk your ip address being automatically banned from stackexchange rss feed

103649
kde	kubuntu
for example an ubuntu user can install the kubuntu environment kde and all its associated programs by selecting kubuntu-desktop.

103658
google-chrome	firefox
this happened a couple of times to me in either firefox or google-chrome the only two browsers i really use

103658
pop-up	dialog
i get out of the situation by clicking the tab s close button over and over again until it closes or chrome pop-up a dialog which says that a plug-in has stopped responding and asks me whether i want to terminate it

103662
opera	firefox
not all browsers support it but the most current versions of most popular browsers such as firefox opera and ie do

103701
mouse	keyboard
if your keyboard or mouse has a key

103701

mouse	keyboard
keyboard or mouse and that you can

103714
gentoo	linux
a coworker suggested gentoo linux and i finally learned it

103760
versioning	upgrade
you should always upgrade to the latest browser versioning if only for the sake of security

103766
persian	farsi
these fonts are created for windows 98 which didn t include full persian support and now we have 2 kind of kafs keheh 0x6a9 ú and arabic kaf 0x643 ùƒ and 2 kind of yehs farsi yeh 0x6cc ûœ and arabic yeh 0x64a ùš

103774
switching	screens
it also gives me the ability to switching between extended screens and remote control modes

103782
put	get
they will most likely put on some tutorials at their meets possibly have kit meets a few times a year and you ll be able to ask questions face to face and get ideas on what to try

103783
google-chrome	firefox
is there a google-chrome equivalent to firefox microsummary bookmarks

103801
sudo	passwd
you can give root a passwd with sudo passwd root and then just log in as normal as root

103802
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade my laptop from xp pro to win 7 pro 32-bit versioning and i need to install the windows server 2003 administration tools pack but the site and the installer say it is not compatible with this versioning of windows

103814
rss	feed
try the feedly extension which is a glorified rss reader based off your google reader feed not bookmarks sorry

103841
vim	emacs
the issue is i want to change emacs to vim in editor style field

103844
ubuntu	linux
so your original is actually better than for example mozilla 5.0 linux gecko ubuntu firefox because the original is a lot more common

103850
uninstall	downgrade
the solutions for downgrade the firefox you should uninstall the firefox and then you could get old version from filehippo.com

103855
folder	directory
i m looking for a pdf printer that doesn t ask the user to choose a filename and directory but simply saves it to a predefined folder with a unique filename

103876
folder	directory
i do this for multiple folder cleanups especially download directory

there s only a single binary of vmware workstation which supports both 32 and 64bit hosts even though it gets installed in program files x86 on windows x64

103898
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko	firefox	safari
you ll have the choice between three browser engines gecko firefox webkit safari google-chrome and trident internet explorer now you can even run all 3 engines side-by-side in a single web browser

103926
mouse	keyboard
i plan on putting this box next to the tv and getting a vga to tv cable and a wireless keyboard mouse and boxee on the machine

103938
filesystems	ntfs
note this only works for ntfs formatted volumes if you copy the files to a drive with any other filesystems fat32 you will be prompted to confirm stream loss the file will be ok however the attached comment will be lost

103980
disk	ram
this is running on a new computer i5 with a terabyte drive 4gigs of ram the disk is still pretty much empty so it should all be pretty snappy

103993
packets	multicast
in multicast protocols 64 is used to restrict the packets to the same physical region

104043
ethernet	wireless
i dont know if i worded that correctly but basically i d like to be able to connect an ethernet cable from one of the ports on the 4100 wired to one of the ports on the 825 wireless and wired and gain 3 extra wired ports as well as serve wireless in my house

104057
filesystems	fat
the best example of this was the point when drive capacities started to push the limits of the fat filesystems

104071
dpkg	apt
you can see what packages you have installed using dpkg -l but in general just find the package you want and tell apt to install it if you already have it then apt will tell you

104152
jobs	cron
debugging cron jobs is tricky

104167
stdout	stderr
if you don t get any mail the system is probably not completely configured all cron implementations that i know of will mail output stdout stderr to the user who created the crontab some also support a variable mailto to set that user

104167
stdout	stderr
in that case redirecting stdout stderr to a file is a good workaround as in mobrule s answer

104206
opera	firefox
change the default homepage for internet explorer firefox and opera

104206
opera	firefox
proxy settings for internet explorer firefox and opera

104224
filesystems	fat
fat for file allocation table is the successor to the original fat12 filesystems that shipped with ms-dos many many years ago

104224
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs or new technology filesystems introduced with windows nt is a completely redesigned filesystems

transparent boxes on design with height and width

104304
photoshop	fireworks
any trick in photoshop fireworks free online tool or any other free and portable utility for windows xp

104338
tiff	bmp
if yes use any vector graphical application to create it in black white boxes than export to some lossless format like bmp or tiff and import to photoshop as mask

104353
post	get
btw i encourage you to post any other questions on our get satisfaction page which we monitor more frequently

104382
docx	xlsx
previously there were asp doc xls ppt etc and now aspx docx xlsx pptx respectively

104382
docx	xlsx
what does x denotes in aspx docx xlsx pptx etc

104410
google-chrome	firefox
i have switched to google-chrome and the tinyurl plugin does this for firefox

104435
screens	tablet
i have an hp touchsmart tx2z and the dinky little string lanyard that comes with the stylus for keeping it from getting lost by keeping it tethered to the computer doesn t cut it for me it s too short to use the tablet in some orientations such as when the screens is angled up from the body and too long and easily tangled when the pen is stored

104445
rss	feed
i really just want to store ichat rss feed and twitter on this other monitor

104459
winpe	dos
winpe probably doesn t have virtual dos machine needed to run dos mode com files

104488
folder	directory
i have a web directory that has many folder and many sub folder containing files

104504
hash	md5
first you will need an md5 hash of the password you want to use

104504
hash	md5
go to this website and type the text you want to use for the password click the button and you will be gifted with the md5 hash string

104509
cpu	processors
if this notebook follows the usual patterns then the intel will be a host-based video system shares cpu and ram with system and the ati mobility will have its own processors and ram

104511
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
if you are using version 7.x the md5 hash will not work i m guessing it uses some sort of salt string on it

104512
ati	nvidia
ati and nvidia graphics chipsets run circles around intel chipsets in every measure except cost

104544
disk	ram
but in technical terms usb thumbdrives are ssds as are drives based on volatile memory and software-based storage technologies like ram disk

104554
g++	gcc
however i did not find gcc or g++ in there

104588
ubuntu	linux
i am pretty new at ubuntu and linux in general

104603
mouse	keyboard
other than the dell built-in keyboard i also use the awesome microsoft natural ergonomic 4000 keyboard actually the 7000 keyboard mouse set

104605
macbook	bootcamp
in order to get the work done i use a macintosh macbook pro 4 1 with a bootcamp partition running windows 7

104605
parallels	bootcamp
to allow for smooth usage i use parallels 5 to virtually boot my windows 7 machine from within os x but whenever i want to do some heavy lifting i reboot into windows 7 on bootcamp which allows me to use my laptop s entire resources for my work

104605
parallels	bootcamp
in theory it isn t a problem to install windows and os x alongside each other and virtually boot the windows under os x using parallels s bootcamp virtualizer

104616
vim	emacs
it gives you a unix console complete with bash shell and all your faves -- ls rm mv cp grep tar find emacs vim svn git etc

104630
screens	tablet
when i plug in an external monitor the touch screens function no longer works properly when i touch the screens it is as if i have touched the external monitor so i cant use the touch function on the tablet screens

104633
x86	64bit
i downloaded itunes 9.0.3 64bit on my windows 7 64bit os and i noticed that on installation the default directory was program files x86

104633
x86	64bit
looking in the two separated program files folders both 32-bit and 64bit i see there are itunes subfolders inside although the bulk of the program resides on the x86 one

104638
x86	64bit
so i assume it s compatible with 64bit but the destination folder is always x86 because it s perhaps hardcoded

104680
multiplying	add
also for example 10000000 binary 128 decimal and if you want to multiplying it by 2 any number of times you ll have to add so many 0s to the end of the number

104681
mp3	wav
to encode some stream as an mp3 or wav at a specified time

104696
single-quotes	double-quotes
unix shells would prefer single-quotes foo instead of double-quotes foo for complete protection from shell interpretation

104732
cpu	processors
now i assume that that s per processors i m on a core 2 duo but that s still an awful lot of cpu for those two processes.

104770
ati	nvidia
the model for display drivers was changed in windows vista and nvidia and ati were too lazy to re-implement horizontal span

104821
cvs	svn
cornerstone or smartcvs for svn cvs respectively

104821
cvs	svn
for version control i recommend svn over cvs

104887
ubuntu	debian
when i turn on my computer using a debian or ubuntu and tried to use the joystick the commands of joystick doesn t pass to so

104887
ubuntu	debian
so debian 5.0 and ubuntu 8.04 lts

104955
mockups	balsamiq
if you are simply looking to design a gui rather than implement a working prototype then balsamiq mockups may be useful

104984
sudo	passwd
i ssh into a ubuntu box with username ubuntu and i can become root without entering a passwd via sudo su

105058
pop-up	dialog
if you ask the app to close everyone that has unsaved work all your notepad and mspaint windows will pop-up with the do you want to save dialog

105063
sorting	grouping
in that case ls will be called multiple times and the sorting will only be correct within each grouping of files

105083
ubuntu	linux
i would prefer to actually perform the sync to my ubuntu guest mostly because of the filename allowed character differences between windows and linux

105122
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
undelete files from fat ntfs and ext2 filesystems

105127
disk	ram
so if you optimize your disk layout thus get more effective bandwidth or more efficient localization of reads and the programs you are running mostly reside in ram like web browsers then you are unlikely to see performance improvements from that alone

105187
google-chrome	firefox
when i watch youtube on firefox or google-chrome nothing shows up under the applications tab

105192
min	max
will see avg max and min time for each hop.

105194
gmail	hotmail
the automatic email forwarding from hotmail to gmail was straightforward but i still log on to windows live messenger with my old account

105194
gmail	hotmail
i have some questions about this if i log in to an im client with my gmail account can i talk to people who have me under my hotmail account without them noticing at all

105194
gmail	hotmail
is there any advantage to chatting from gmail instead of hotmail

105199
x86	64bit
amd64 or x86_64 are identical and all 64bit x86 architecture cpus will work with these which is to say all the amd or intel cpus except the itanium line from intel

105199
x86	64bit
amd created and added the 64bit extensions to the 32bit x86 architecture

105263
mouse	keyboard
and keyboard input or method only to have no ability to enter them since then there is no keyboard or mouse control

105264
cat	tee
it can be some other command too - cat grep tee - everything breaks the chain

105268
post	get
if i press esc immediately after turning it on i get the post screen and it counts up the ram

105268
post	get
if i press del immediately after turning it on i get the post screen and and the entering setup... message

105281
mockups	balsamiq
for under sblair has already mentioned balsamiq mockups but another nice one is pencils

105283
put	get
you can put in all your info and get into windows without having to do more then boot to the cd

105291
stdout	fflush
then i found this description of buffering in pipelines - it looks like what it boils down to is that some command line utils eg tail -f routinely call fflush on stdout and others cut grep etc do not

105291
stdout	stderr
you might try adding 2 1 before your first | in the pipeline to redirect stderr to stdout

105300
rss	feed
in my team we would like to have a single blog that merges all the posts that each individual has in its own blog hosted in different blogging platforms that publish rss atom feed

105320
fiddler	charles
after a brief look i did find a program called charles which some people refer to as fiddler for linux but i have no experience using it

105327
hash	md5
a simple way would be to store your credentials in an md5 hash file or store the hash in the program as a variable for comparison

105368
sudo	passwd
if you are allowed configuration of sudo to use the su command it asks you for your passwd and then logs you in as root

105369
sudo	passwd
in addition to what you said su requires the root passwd and sudo requires your user passwd

105369
sudo	passwd
therefore sudo su - will put you into a root environment but it will ask you for your user passwd instead of the root passwd once sudo has given you root privileges su - can be executed with no passwd

105371
put	get
i suppose you could put the jack package in your sound queue and add some sort of real-time filter but honestly i think the pain of trying to get that to work wouldn t be worth it

105378
post	get
when i start the machine i get a single beep before it post

105409
hex	binary
and have it send the binary 8n1 repressentaion of each 2 digit hex pair

105430
ubuntu	opensuse
for example i love the ll command which is not defined by default under ubuntu but is under opensuse

105482
pop-up	dialog
i click the pop-up and it gives me the dialog box with the option of a tick box saying notify me if my device can run faster

105482
pop-up	dialog
ps- i had screenshots of the pop-up and dialog but i can t post yet cause i am new

105529

both create all the ntfs filesystems structures in the same way

105534
ubuntu	freebsd
i m running both an ubuntu server and a freebsd server headless

105534
ubuntu	freebsd
the freebsd one sits here in a cabinet the ubuntu one in a co-lo facility

105544
mouse	keyboard
i do not know of a way to open the context menu for the current selection which is what i think you really want but you can â œright clickâ whatever whatever is under the mouse pointer with only the keyboard

105548
nas	qnap
i have no idea if this is related to your problem but i also had problems accessing my qnap nas after i upgraded to windows 7

105582
ubuntu	linux
i ve never dwelt into the internal configurations of initd for ubuntu in particular but for other linux flavours it s usually in etc inittab

from what i understand wake on lan only works if the magic packets is sent on the broadcast address from the same subnet as the machine you want to wake

the keyboard and mouse are unresponsive

105967
subnet	packets
additionally a host will not send an arp packets for an ip address that s not on it s local subnet as it knows that the ip address is not local and that it needs to send it to it s default gateway and therefore will not send an arp packets for that ip address

debian	linux
the first linux box i administered was one i installed corel linux on in 1999 the selling point of corel linux to me was that it was at heart a debian distro which i liked the sound of although my previous linux contact had been with slackware and redhat and with all the fonts you could shake a stick at

106563
vmware	virtualbox
i had a long play with both qemu and virtualbox but i was left with an impression that they re unfinished products when placed alongside vmware

106594
ubuntu	linux
if it is a dedicated virtual-host machine than i d most likely go with virtualbox and a completely lightweight linux underneath xubuntu and lubuntu are jumping to my mind maybe even an own build which does not have more than the basic kernel ubuntu server install + a lightweight window manager just running virtualbox

i m afraid it doesn t show processors affinity but it will enable you to log which processes are running and for how long

you can buy a usb adapter for fairly cheap which will come with all the required software to use it and should interface fine with any bluetooth device

does anybody have this tablet or something equivalent with a 12 screens like the dell xt or hp tm2

opera	firefox
it s designed for firefox opera users so they can get windows updates without using internet explorer but perhaps it will let you update your machine while side stepping the group policy issue

107269
move	drag
i would recommend using the right-mouse button to drag and drop selecting copy instead of move

107282
wan	lan
port forwarding on basic routers normally only forwards traffic from a wan ip address to lan ip address

107282
wan	lan
i think in this case because you are trying to connect from a lan ip address to a wan ip address the data is lost because the router does not have any lan to wan port forwarding rules set up

107282
wan	lan
only wan to lan

107299
ubuntu	linux
my recommendation would be to download a linux live cd ubuntu has pretty good driver support and see if it still happens - linux uses completely separate drivers to windows

107332

i am unable to connect to an rss feed in outlook due to the following error

copying	overwrite
so by copying the files over-top again form the spare you may be able to get all the original files back in place but without messing up the hopefully repaired boot system and without having to run a chkdsk which may make things worse in this situation as the partition table will be properly updated when the files are overwrite by the the cd based os

107571
ubuntu	linux
i m a linux enthusiast who is eager to try ubuntu in a full installation

107580
filesystems	ntfs	ubuntu	linux
not only it is hard to enforce linux to use ntfs filesystems although ubuntu should be able to do so but also because those two operating systems have very different approach to hard drives partitions and system devices

107595
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems is not ntfs

107646
postgresql	mysql
my experience is that postgresql is handling complex queries much better than mysql so if you will be doing some advanced sql i can recommend postgresql

107646
postgresql	mysql
when mysql was split in one commercial and one open sourced version 2006 i believe we turned to postgresql

107646

as jay states postgresql needs a bit more tuning and you might find it a bit harder to get started compared to mysql

107805
vpn	lan
as part of this it has set your dns settings for the vpn to be the vpn lan ones so that you can resolve dns names of your company network hence your problem

107805
vpn	lan
there will be an option to allow local lan access in the vpn settings but that is normally administratively turned off

here is a link showing you how to turn on allow local lan access but your vpn admins have probably locked that down to prevent it

it tests all aspects of your computer including cpu hard drive ram gpu network and disk drive

108385
hash	md5
having said all that it is just possible that some stray cosmic rays could flip a bit in the data as it arrives on disk so where large files are distributed there s usually a checksum published somewhere typically it s an md5 or sha hash and you can find software to compute these checksums on your own copy of the file

the decision between ps 2 style mini-din keyboard mouse connectors or usb connectors may be more of an issue though not overly so

109197
mouse	keyboard
new portable devices coming with no old-style keyboard mouse ports many small-form pcs like acer s revo don t either and i ve seen full-size desktops without them too so those old ports are on the way out

you don t need to unplug your pc and plug it back in after putting it into standby mode either simply pressing a key on the keyboard or clicking the mouse should work unless of course both are usb connected and your motherboard can t recognize them in that power state

109231

if you have a ps 2 keyboard or mouse pressing or clicking either should bring the machine out of standby

and a feature of metavnc is that it can hide the background and only show the windows which it was then showing on the client pc amongst it s own windows

cpu	processors
for example in mothboards desgined for 286 and 386sx processors 8-bit simms actually usually 9-bit with an extra parity bit for error detection were installed in pairs to match up with the cpu s 16 bit databus

109343
cpu	processors
it used to be that memory controllers would have to institute wait states in the ram so that the processors didn t miss messages that came too fast but these days cpus can eat data much faster than ram can hand it out hence the need for lots of faster-but-more-expensive cache memory on the cpu itself

from every time i used swap even on linux back 10 years ago and nowadays on ubuntu i could never see improvements on performance

109661
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
two things i miss from firefox and google-chrome when using safari on mac are the command + option + arrows that are replaced by control + tab or command + shift + arrows and specially the command + #number which will invoke bookmarks instead of tabs

109681
google-chrome	firefox
i use lazarus a lot on google-chrome and firefox

109691
128bit	64bit
long story short ganged treats the memory subsystem as a single 128bit bus while unganged treats the memory subsystem as dual independent 64bit buses

rss	feed
i would like to export-backup the rss feed i have aggregated in internet explorer but i can t find them which would be the first step in the process

109703
rss	feed
rss feed are now integrated to windows and internet explorer simply is a program that can access them

109703
rss	feed
the actual location for the rss feed are

109704
rss	feed
if you want to export and backup rss feed i would follow the steps under the section to export rss feed from internet explorer 8 from this page

109719
chown	chmod
if you want to keep using the existing working copy for some reason one thing you could try is giving the non-root user rw access to everything under all .ssh directories with chown chmod

109724
pull	push
i don t change my vim settings too often but when i do i commit and push it and a simple git pull brings it up to date where needed

109732
kubuntu	gnome
i m running kubuntu 9.10 w gnome i have a static ip defined in etc network interfaces

109742
mouse	keyboard
if you are getting this every time you run prime95 i would highly recommend you try unplugging everything from your machine other than power video and keyboard and mouse unless you are confident of using the machine without one

109765
mouse	keyboard
if you haven t set up your workstation as follows already i would suggest keeping the mouse just above your lap--the keyboard tray is a great location for it if you desk has one

109801
pull	push
upon restart my sent mail was back but then disappeared on first sync because it looks like it pull email statuses from gmail down to mail.app where as i need to push an entire folder label mailbox to gmail

109806
filesystems	ntfs
if there are many small files then this will reduce overall transfer rate by increasing head movement latency in both the source and destination drives as the tool opens new files and the os keeps directory entries and other metadata such as the filesystems s journal if you are using meta-data journaling like ext3 ext4 and ntfs do by default up to date during the transfer

109827
mouse	keyboard
you should be able to override tab switching shortcut keys with the keyboard shortcuts override in the keyboard mouse preference pane

109827
mouse	keyboard
top-left apple icon system preferences keyboard mouse keyboard shortcuts + button

109829
vmware	virtualbox
i just downloaded vmware i used to use virtualbox but i needed windows aero and vbox doesn t support that yet but it will automatically resize the guest when i resize the window and i do not want that

109846
automator	iphoto
i m trying to find away to create an automator action that puts photos into iphoto but also adds the hidden tag to them

109860
ubuntu	linux
for what it is worth i find running something like feather linux on hardware that old is generally far more productive than a full modern distribution like fedora or ubuntu

109890
mp3	flac
i m looking for a program to convert flac files to mp3 while preserving the embedded metadata including album art

109906
folder	directory
just uncompress intelburntest in a directory like c my_ubcd4win_custom_files and add this directory in custom include files or folder from this directory

109913
debian	linux
aptitude udev shows that the debian package is installed even though udev cannot be supported on this xen vps and i believe isn t supported by default until later stable versions of the linux kernel

109913
debian	linux
linux version 2.6.16.29-xen root potige gcc version 4.1.2 20061028 prerelease debian 4.1.1-19 #1 smp tue dec 5 20 43 23 cet 2006

rtsp	rtmp
orbit downloader handle mms rtsp and rtmp protocols

109925
filesystems	ntfs
for instance in the ntfs filesystems time stamps are stored in utc

109941
filesystems	ntfs
as an addendum note that while file modification dates from ntfs or other filesystems may be timezone aware exif data eg date time a picture was taken with your camera may very well not be and may not be stored as utc either so can prove tricky to convert

109965
kate	kde	kate	gnome	kate	gedit	kde	gnome
i prefer the gnome desktop to kde - but i prefer the kate text editor to gedit - but gedit is the default in gnome

109999
cat	tee
if you want to record the session to file as well as sending a copy through the pipe to less do something like cat tmp scriptpipe | tee file to save sessionlog to | less

110018
disk	ram
if that fails i d reboot with the system disk in the drive hold down d and run an extended hardware test to check your ram hd in particular or use tech tools deluxe if you have the applecare although the aeht is best and free

110053

the machines this program runs on are typically ubuntu linux boxes

110080
disk	ram
or is there a way to create a ram disk that writes-through to real disk

110116
ssd	sata
the throughput of the ssd is about 190mb s per sequential read nonsequential is slower which does not even nearly take the full bandwidth of the sata bus

110116
ssd	sata
just because usb2.0 is slower than sata does not necessarily mean that using an ssd through usb2.0 is a waste of money

110125
disk	ram
the disk cache will work well with all available ram space

110138
emacs	aquamacs
for aquamacsemacs it is .emacs or library preferences aquamacs emacs preferences.el

110165

i d like to share the best among them with an audience via an rss feed but i want that feed to include the original enclosure

110170
solaris	aix
if either the client or server lack a kernel-based random number device eg solaris 9 aix 5.2 hp-ux 11.11 and no substitute is available eg prngd it s possible that one of the programs called by ssh-rand-helper to generate entropy is hanging

google-chrome	firefox
i am recently trying google-chrome on my xp machine coming from firefox which i found to be frustratingly slow

110227
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
parallels is the fastest and virtualbox the best value for money it is free and excellent but vmware fusion is the easiest to use you can load pre-canned appliances for linux or turn your pld windows machine including applications into a virtual machine

110228
parallels	bootcamp
if you use parallels you can even set it up to talk to a bootcamp partition

110231
stdout	stderr
the output lines aren t redirected to dev null because they aren t stdout stderr from the kill process

110241
opera	google-chrome
i ve recently used the opera browser because it s now faster than google-chrome

chown	sudo
sudo chown -r root wheel library startupitems

110267
filesystems	ntfs
which is not safe because the filesystems of my flash drive is ntfs

110325
post	get
so the steps to get this were different which led me to post this before even attempting anything mentioned there

110336
disk	ram
i suspect the windows boot manager doesn t know how to load linux kernels and initial ram disk so grub is necessary

110353
daemon	cron
here are answers for one cron daemon dillon s cron dcron which i m the current developer of

110353
stdout	stderr
if there s any output to stdout or stderr yet another process is forked to mail it

110354
disk	ram
the hibernate file is only used when hibernating or waking up from hibernate and it s as big as your ram so moving it to a different disk is probably good

110379
put	get
the e-mail field is being used by gpg to get the keys of the recipients so if you put bogus values in there it won t be able to use it automatically

110386
vmware	virtualbox
well it s a bit of a cludge but i think that using usb support in any of the virtual machines would block the host or other machines from seeing the drive at least is does on my virtualbox not sure about vmware

110395
centos	linux
i have an nvidia ion board with 4 sata ports and want to use that to run a linux server centos 5.4

filesystems	hfs+
even if they don t understand the hfs+ filesystems they will be able to read it in raw format

110625
google-chrome	firefox
i got very accustomed to the way firefox and google toolbar worked and now i d liked to do something similar with google-chrome

110650
udp	tcp
for lowest latency but less error correction udp is a better option than tcp for example with linux the jackd sound server has a backend that can stream audio over udp for this very reason - jackd is more oriented to perfect sound quality pro audio production though

110657
mouse	keyboard
attach external keyboard and or mouse and see if this will work for you

110685
rar	zip	rar	gzip
xarchiver supports 7-zip arj bzip2 gzip rar lha lzma lzop deb rpm tar and zip archives

since i had already replaced the memory i suspected the hd to be the culprit and replaced it with a new ocz vertex 64gb ssd with a new sata cable and did a re-install again

110775
ubuntu	linux
the linux kernel provides a notification feature known as inotify and ubuntu provides various packages supporting that functionality

110775
kde	kubuntu
i m not sure what the kubuntu kde equivalent notification daemon is or what package provides it

110916
ati	nvidia
the board i put in my home server last year has on-board graphics an nvidia chipset iirc though there are similar motherboards with ati graphics chips in case you have a preference with both vga and dvi outputs and could happily drive two monitors at 1920x1080 for non-gaming work including hd video if i wanted it to

110937
xfce	kde
you can substitute kubuntu-desktop if you use kde or xubuntu-desktop if you use xfce

110949

111025
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
this is true in opera safari google-chrome i.e. and firefox at least

111027
mouse	keyboard
i had a wireless usb adapter on a system that i did not have a keyboard mouse connected to for a few years and had a batch file that would routinely check for internet access and if there was none it would use devcon to cycle the usb device on off

111041
ubuntu	linux
my computer runs ubuntu linux 9.10

111051

but we re going to use it to map a keyboard key to a mouse button with

111051
mouse	keyboard
keyboard looks like a menu with a mouse cursor to mouse button 2

111057
jobs	cron
if your find command supports fractional values for -mtime or has -mmin gnu find has both posix does not seem to require either you could â throttleâ the cron jobs with with find and touch

google-chrome	firefox
i installed silverlight from firefox and when i browsed to www.silverlight.net in google-chrome it just worked

111065
filesystems	hfs
for various unimportant reasons i want to format a partition using macos s native hfs filesystems

this will take priority over any allow permissions inherited by the folder if you want this to propagate into all subfolders you can use advanced button and the replace all existing inheritable.. checkbox

111199
filesystems	fat
the windows folder is located on a drive that is formatted with the fat or fat32 filesystems

111199
filesystems	ntfs
the make this folder private option requires the ntfs filesystems

111258
16-bit	64bit
unless your vista or windows 7 or xp 2000 for that matter are the 64bit version then 16-bit executables will run fine

111258
16-bit	64bit
the 64bit flavours of windows won t run 16-bit software but i don t see a mention of 64bit in the original question

itunes	iphoto
the moral dont delete system files from your time machine backup use this method only for your personal files such as your itunes media folder or your iphoto library

111433
switching	screens
screens mode switching allows you to easily change resolutions from the system tray and also define custom hotkeys to change resolutions

111455
mouse	trackpad
it allows you to add new trackpad or magic mouse gestures and is pretty customizable

111535
free	malloc
you could ld_preload another version of malloc and add a thread to free it after a specified amount of seconds

111575
mouse	keyboard
if it would then there are other things that would stop working like the keyboard mouse hard drives et.c

111575
mouse	keyboard
i had to write my own handlers for keyboard and mouse input and disk i o doesn t work at all in that state.

111613
vim	emacs	kde	gnome
some simple ways to reduce ram cpu usage use ash instead of bash use rxvt instead of xterm gnome-terminal use screen instead of having multiple terminals open use rox-filer if you absolutely must have a graphic file system browser use a lightweight window manager like evilwm or icewm instead of gnome or kde learn how to do file management from the shell use nvi instead of vim use qemacs isntead of emacs use links with the -g flag for web sites that are not ajax use google chrome for ajax websites use aptitude or apt-get instead of synaptic for package management for debian-derived distros

111615
opera	firefox
the current version comes with firefox personally i like the previous release with opera better

111637
ubuntu	linux
one of the workaround i have been considering is to install a windows xp ubuntu linux on a virtualbox and use that system when i really really need to printer

111639
udp	tcp
sygate also indicates that the control center is using ports 7305 for tcp and 30202 for udp as well so i ve added them to the rule

111680
put	get
the warranty should still be good you will probably get a new battery put this issue behind

111704
pop-up	dialog
no uac dialog asking for privileged rights pop-up when the exe is run the exe iteself doesn t do anything that d require this

111712
mp3	flac
dbpoweramp music converter preserves embedded album art when converting from flac to mp3

111714
folder	directory
the folder directory system has been made but all the directory are empty.

111776
tunnel	vpn
caveat i ve not yet been paranoid enough about the traffic that is sent over my home wireless network or others i have any responsability for the few things we are that paranoid about such as client data or authentication to access the same simply don t go anywhere near a wireless connection without being wrapped in a vpn tunnel or other encryption so i have not yet got around to setting this up myself

111788
sorting	grouping
sorting by subject would grouping related tasks

111868
filesystems	ntfs	ubuntu	linux
also for multimedia you want maximum disk read write speed especially if multitracking or working with video which are the two main reasons i could imagine you are using ubuntu studio and ntfs is a poor choice for that it has fragmentation issues even under windows not to mention linux and it is very far from being the fastest performing filesystems for a linux system

111870
kde	gnome
i have firefox as my desktop s default browser ubuntu gnome 9.10 and most applications open links into ff readily enough including choqok a kde twitter client

111909
titlebar	window
why don t you just press the maximize button on the window s titlebar

111927
disk	ram
i believe the buffered song is stored in ram and hence is not physically located anywhere on your disk

111953
mouse	keyboard
is there an app that will allow me to use my phone as a keyboard and or mouse

111980
disk	ram
don t let the work fault worry you - a hard page fault just means a processes accessed a page that was currently available in ram for that operation so the os needed to read it from disk either from the program s file or swap space or make a new copy to write to if it is a copy-on-right page

111983
cpu	processors
vmware supports running 64 bit vms on a 32 bit host if the cpu s have support for the required features not all 64-bit processors do and i presume some other virtualisation platforms can do this too

111984
ethernet	wireless
i ve got an asdl router at home that is connected via ethernet to a wireless router

111988
button	checkbox
ctrl-click or secondary mouse button on the file - get info - check the locked checkbox

112124
kde	gnome
edit just curious gnome or kde i don t know if that will make a difference but it could

112128
photoshop	paint.net
i ve noticed there are lots of plugins for paint.net but i can t seem to find one that essentially saves for web almost like photoshop does this

112168
ubuntu	linux
if you have a sufficiently modern linux installation and reasonably new nvidia cards and driver i have 185 at work ubuntu 190 at home fedora12 you ve already done the hard part

112226
toolbar	docking
i tracked down a code project that shows how a docking toolbar works but there were a lot of bugs in it and i didn t have the energy to fix it

112235
daemons	launchd
these work great for the shell itself and processes forked off the shell but not for processes started outside the shell for example daemons kicked off at boot time or particularly annoying for me is that mongrel launchd by capistrano doesn t seem to have these variables set and hence ruby doesn t have access to them

112243
mouse	keyboard
i d l ike to be able to see the screen and also use the mouse and keyboard

112275
folder	directory
i need to write an unix shell script tran.sh that moves the csv input files from exp files folder to exp ready directory

112304
opera	firefox
with firefox internet explorer opera

112304
opera	safari
opera and safari ver 1 and 2

if you have x11 enabled you can use a number of linux editors like gvim kate kwrite kdevelop etc

112349
photoshop	fireworks
this can be achieved with adobe fireworks or photoshop

112353
bash	tcsh
info time gives as example time -v sleep 4 however when i execute that both in bash or tcsh i get

112384
kde	gnome
if you re using kde or gnome you should start poking around their respective mouse configuration panels

112435
filesystems	fat
fat would probably be your best bet - that is the same filesystems used on most usb drives

112441
mouse	keyboard
teleport lets you use a single mouse and keyboard to control several macs like synergy

112442
trojan	virus
for desktop managers a trojan or a virus can take all your password

112448
itunes	iphoto
activation of sharing in itunes and iphoto for sharing music and pictures read only but this works on lan as well

112459
wan	lan	wan	subnet
since your modem is on the same subnet all of the request destined for the modem are actually routed to the lan never to the wan interface

112462
filesystems	xfs	lvm	xfs
i don t know about freenas but openfiler uses lvm on the disks to create volumes and either ext3 or xfs for the actual filesystems

112490
opera	firefox
have you try another browser like firefox or opera

112491
rss	feed
i would like to be able to browse the internet and drag available mp3 files of various podcast episodes into my own private rss feed

112491

i would like to then subscribe to this rss feed with itunes

112491
rss	feed
i subscribe to it conversations and they have a private rss feed that you can create of their episodes

112491
rss	feed
one of the reasons i am looking for this that my ipod touch has problems handling podcast playlists that span multiple rss feed

112499

add all of your podcast rss feed to this folder

112507
ubuntu	linux
so is it the case with all the other linux flavors like fedora ubuntu etc

112565
postgresql	mysql
i want to find a relational db design tool for linux that could export db schema for mysql sqlite and postgresql at least

112565
kde	gnome
- i use gnome but kde tools are interesting too

112584
sudo	passwd
since recently when i log into my ubuntu desktop 9.04 with gnome set up and then log out i get a popup that states that still someone is logged in and that i need to enter the admin sudo passwd to continue the shutdown

112592
kde	gnome
and then it will also depend on whether or not your using gnome or kde as your desktop environment

112592
gentoo	ubuntu
my experience lies with gnome on gentoo ubuntu and a little experience with redhat

112597
disk	ram
i m running windows 7 ultimate 64 bit on a dell vostro 1720 with 8gb of ram 7200rpm disk 2.53 ghz core2duo windows 7 64 bit is a supported option and the laptop came with the os pre-installed

112602
tunnel	vpn
have you considered an alternate solution like a vpn or ssh tunnel

112608
kde	gnome
however in my experience kde gnome and xcfe desktop environments will automatically mount most removable devices

112617
itunes	iphoto
applications such as itunes and iphoto each need to be told individually to put their libraries in a new location

112636
rss	feed
every now and then i check the website or rss feed for these applications to see if there is a new version

112636
rss	feed
this is tedious and i want it to be collated into one place one rss feed would be fine

112636
rss	feed
i know i could monitor filehippo s own rss feed but this contains way too much software and i am only interested in a small percentage of them

112636
rss	feed

the solution was to uncheck allow this device to wake up the computer on both the mouse and keyboard devices selecting them independently does not resolve the issue

perhaps updating my mouse keyboard drivers will fully resolve the issue

113874

when connected to the lan in my office ie google-chrome and firefox all work

113882
aspose.words	aspose.pdf

aspose.words now converts to pdf by itself you previously needed aspose.words + aspose.pdf

114015

114086
hash	md5
you may find iso files that come with an md5 as each file has a unique hash well unique enough that it can be used for verification and so a corrupt download though not one tampered with--that is it s valid to use md5 for integrity checks but not validation or security will not return the same hash as the original file

114088
hash	md5
the md5 is a hash of the related iso in order to verify its integrity

114088

114972
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu these are boot grub menu.lst for grub1 or boot grub grub.cfg for grub2 although you d probably just run update-grub to do it automatically

google-chrome	firefox
not exactly what you re looking for but it allows you to overwrite css for arbitrary websites or firefox s google-chrome if you like

114986
switching	screens

115524
ubuntu	linux
if you have a free partition to install a gnu linux os you can encrypt the whole partition and put your boot partition inside your thumb drive then you have just to select which wares you want on it i d suggest a custom ubuntu server installation or an archlinux installation as well

115545
pop-up	dialog
on the limited account only the open with dialog box pop-up on certain .exe s i attempt to run - particularly firefox and ie

115565
disk	ram
i know that this happens when ram becomes saturated and os has nowhere else to store data other than the hard disk

115633
put	get
what you will probably have to do to get round this is put your command line in quotes so

115637
mp4	h.264
here s a free program that will convert mov and mp4 files to an avi container without re-encoding the h.264 video inside so it s much faster than any video conversion -- about as fast as just copying the files off the cards -- and absolutely no loss of quality

115689
post	get
make the executable c windows system32 inetsrv fcgiext.dll the extension .php and ensure verbs are limited to get head post check the script engine and verify that file exists check boxes

folder	dir
i was transfering a folder with some php files to the htdocs dir when the connection broke

i would start by unplugging everything possible excluding screen keyboard no mouse unless you need it and video then turn on your machine and try going in to safe mode

116004
disk	ram
if you think about it you actually read parts of your disk more often that you access some parts of the ram

116004
disk	ram
which makes sense to put this ram on the disk while using ram to cache hdd data

116005
disk	ram
if the kernel uses all the ram it can loading your image requires that the kernel transfers 200mb from the ram to the disk

116023
google-chrome	firefox
as for download managers i use the downthemall firefox extension which may be no use to you as you presumably prefer google-chrome i know someone who uses multiget which is in either the universe or multiverse repository of ubuntu though i ve not used it myself

116032
filesystems	xfs
it also supports a boatload of raid options and filesystems i m using xfs personally

116035
filesystems	ntfs
short summary the windows 7 ntfs filesystems driver has a bug that sometimes when a process tries to access a file that s in use by another process such as a background file indexing service it doesn t yield an â œaccess deniedâ error which would be the normal case but instead â œfile corruptedâ

116035
filesystems	ntfs
this is a known regression in windows 7 in the ntfs filesystems

116058
icmp	tcp
and only when data is rare use active test icmp ping tcp ping

116062

general agreement with the concept as far as specifics for general out of the box browsing i recommend linux mint which is a distro that is based on ubuntu but has a lot of the browser extensions and codecs already loaded

116540

116792
mouse	keyboard
i have replaced my desktop workstation with a 17 laptop and it is ergonomically terrible the solution was to use an external keyboard and mouse but still it would stay way below eye level some people then suggested a vertical laptop stand so i got the cheapo one below

116796
mouse	keyboard
if you find yourself constantly using your laptop as your desktop computer full time workstation then you really should consider at the least an external monitor and keyboard mouse

116807
rss	feed
how about google reader which tracks changes and makes an rss feed for sites without it and a rss feed reader

116841

the broadcom 440x 10 100 integrated controller is likely your ethernet also called lan port not a wireless card

116890
freebsd	linux
mostly driver-wise i d really like linux or freebsd running in dualboot

116903

116942
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried with ie8 firefox and google-chrome

116953
freebsd	linux
i think if you went with a business class middle of the road laptop from most manufacturers it would be fairly painless to get linux of freebsd working

truecrypt	umount
basically i want to umount a truecrypt volume when the usb stick with the keyfile on it is removed and ideally shut down the computer as well

117074
ubuntu	linux
i chose ubuntu linux in the os selection

117079
disk	ram
what you re after is a ram disk

117088
disk	ram
actually you re probably talk about a disk cache more than a ram disk based on the sentence which can temporarily store the files that needs constant transfer from the computer to an external device

117169
put	get
if you can find somewhere stable to store it - such as a shelf - where you re not going to have to move it again until you put it back into your computer you should be able to get away without the padding

117582
centos	linux
the majority of our workstations are os x but there are a few running linux centos 5.3 and as time goes on we expect the proportion of linux workstations to increase at some point we expect to move the server side over to linux too but for now we re running with what we ve already got

117584
opensuse	linux
the major difference between opensuse and almost any popular linux distro and windows is that in most of the cases you do not need to find and download and install software from the software vendor

117585
google-chrome	firefox
i thought it might be my new firebug version 1.5.2 or firefox in general but they re not working in ie or google-chrome either

117836
cout	cin
so i was thinking if i enter this character into a console and then print it lets say in c++ using cin and cout and i have set locale to czech stdin must actually send some non-ascii code of the character i pressed to input stream

117864
ubuntu	debian
this is a good fairly complete walkthrough of one particular setup - its for ubuntu but most of it should carry forward well enough for debian

117890
google-chrome	firefox
i would then use either firefox or google-chrome as the web browser and have a non adobe pdf viewer

117938
ubuntu	debian
for sure to have any chance the application need to be for the same cpu arch same glibc version and the 2 distros need to be with a common base - it s easier to run debian app on ubuntu etc

118009

118098
ubuntu	linux
an easier way might be to use a linux livecd like ubuntu knoppix etc. and see what it can see of your files

118107
switching	screens
when you are watching a screens sharing session commanded by the other user in other words you are watching the other user doing stuff in his computer how do i switching back to my computer without disrupting the other user by stealing the mouse to click on the my computer window

118107

118264
ethernet	wireless
is there any way to set it up so that the ethernet port is bridged over the wireless adapter portion

118264
ethernet	wireless
the twist here is that the ethernet is initially used to connect the wireless print server to the router for configuration can t configure it wireless if you are initially on a encrypted network

118264
ethernet	wireless
to be clear the computer i want to connect bridge into the network does not have a wireless card is far from the router and i do not want to lay ethernet cable to connect it

118264
ethernet	wireless
while i could certainly buy a legitimate wireless bridge to accomplish this i figured since the print server already has an ethernet port see if i can t use that

118279
hash	salt
which algorithms are used which hash do they use salt ...

118284
freebsd	opensolaris
freebsd and opensolaris seem to be the best choices for hosting zfs

118306
ubuntu	linux
in linux you can obviously do the same but i can t really recommend much - in the past i have used ubuntu server + webmin to do the hard work if you are good at linux you may find it easy - but i find using windows server to be much simpler for this.

118333
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome and internet explorer

118337
vim	notepad++
for starters you could use something like notepad++ or vim

118341
google-chrome	firefox
another idea which i find much easier on the fingers and works in firefox and i think google-chrome not sure of others is to use ctrl-pgup and ctrl-pgdn to go through the list of tabs.

118358
disk	ram
i ve created a fairly large ram disk and was wondering whether it is possible to move c program files directory there

118371

the reason the child s process id is returned to the parent is because a process can have more than one child so there is no function that allows a process to obtain the process ids of its children

118371

disk	ram
assuming your ram disk is persistent i suppose you could move everything over there and set up a symbolic link from the c folder to the ram drive s folder

118382
x86	64bit
if you go to the registry and navigate to hkey_local_machine software microsoft windows currentversion there are one or two on 64bit versions keys there programfilesdir and programfilesdir x86 on 64bit versions

118382
disk	ram
keep in mind the info people above have said about your ram disk being persistent or not and also be aware that some programs do not behave properly if your program files directory is moved

118386

if you need to change directory an easy way is to type cd be sure there s a space after and then drag and drop a folder from the finder onto the terminal window

118395

118395
fink	macports
let fink install in sw or macports install in opt local

118395
fink	macports

118482
debian	linux
fink was the original open source package manager for mac os x but it does not have the close organizational ties to apple and it chose to follow the debian linux apt-get tradition

118482
fink	macports
fink and macports have learned that lesson already and install their own copies of things in their own directory hierarchies sw for fink opt for macports

google-chrome	firefox
i have recently been testing a website and found animated gif images that seem to show fine in ie and firefox but in google-chrome they only show briefly and then dissapear

118660

it could be that ie and firefox just assume that if the value isn t specified it should be treated as auto repeat on while google-chrome assumes that the default is auto repeat off

as well as the drive space differential 4 8 16 mb compared to 160 the slow speed of cheap ssds and the expense of faster ones is why ssd based netbooks are becoming rarer - the buying public prefer the storage space and write speed of a spinning disk over the random access speed and no-moving-parts-y-ness of an ssd at the same price particularly when running windows which especially with a small amount of ram seem much worse affected by the slow write speed than linux in my limited experience of windows on these things and needs more space to be useful

mouse	keyboard
due to the way my desk is set up it s kind of a stretch to reach over to the laptop s keyboard all the time and having a second keyboard mouse is rather cumbersome albeit manageable if i keep the second keyboard in my lap

vim	emacs
if you want to see a religious battle on the subject of archive file formats take a short trip into what is left of usenet or pirate sorry scene territory and dare to suggest that something might be more suitable than .rar archives - it is almost as incendiary as suggesting an emacs user try vim or vice-versa

freebsd	linux
is there a way to add linux binary compatibility to mac os x 10.5+ such as that found in freebsd

119802

i recently discovered the keyboard shortcut for metacity s full screen option where a window is fully maximised with titlebar and border hidden

119852
google-chrome	firefox	folder	directory

we used cable ties and folded up some of the longer cables so that they weren t any longer than they needed to be but this meant that the position of some of our devices like the keyboard and the mouse were essentially fixed until we removed the ties

folder	directory
for example when you select a favorite place in the sidebar no ancestors of that folder will be visitable without pressing cmd+up but hitting cmd+up causes the current directory to lose focus or disappear entirely depending on the number of levels

120747
switching	screens
part of this was answered in my earlier question which helped me get past the login screens without passwords after booting and after choosing switching user but once the screensaver kicks in and i wake it up again the system does not present the choose user screens

120747
switching	screens
instead it either turns off the screensaver and presents the desktop of the most recent user or if the screensaver is set to lock the screens prompt for the user s password which can be handily surpassed by clicking the switching user button and choosing the same user again

debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian
debian and debian-based distributions like ubuntu tend to leave the root password empty thus disabling the root login

120943
debian	centos
it was the only distro after debian centos fedora and knoppix all failed me that i managed to get working

121034
unix	bsd
what would be the equivalent to anydvd on unix linux bsd etc

121052
ubuntu	debian
there are many flavours distributions such as fedora ubuntu and debian

121052
google-chrome	firefox
with that in mind if they wanted it for run-of-the-mill use such as writing documents and surfing the web i would point them to openoffice.org and firefox google-chrome then explain that with linux they can do practically everything they do on windows without have to spend hundreds on software

121053
folder	directory
in each new users home directory create a folder that is read write execute by all in the gituser group

121100

also check your junk folder in outlook and simply drag and drop that folder or individual messages into your inbox or wherever you want to move them

121140
disk	ram
i know that ram disk are fast faster than any disk but they lose their contents on a shutdown of the operating system

121143
disk	ram
a good time to use a ram disk is to load an image on a disk or ram that does not touch the actual hard drive

121143
disk	ram
in many cases automatic installations and system restore disk are loaded via the network through a pxe system onto a ram disk and then offloaded onto the virtual file system

121145
disk	ram
i am not sure about using a ram disk for speed advantages but they can be used to create a secure area

121145
disk	ram
if you create a ram disk and use it as a working area any temporary sensitive etc files created on it will go as soon as the machine is turned off

121165
disk	ram
it s useful in a server environment when you have some files that are written to or read from very often - sql databases for example - simply locate them on a ram disk and these operations will be orders of magnitude faster

121165
disk	ram
on a ram disk which dramatically speeds things up

121187
disk	ram
ram disk are often used on live cds or floppy disk where you want to decompress data from the cd floppy but don t want to write it to any hard disk drive

121187
disk	ram
a linux live cd will tend to boot and run way faster on a ram disk because random file access is so slow on a cd

121187
disk	ram
ram disk are also useful where you will be doing anything that has a lot of random access obviously

121187
disk	ram
any program that randomly accesses thousands of different files will run much better if those files are on a ram disk where the seek time on a normal hard disk drive is eliminated

121211
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
your only true chance will be to use some kind of file-restore undelete thats recovers files from fat and ntfs filesystems

121258
ubuntu	linux
well i found this page on how to take a screenshot on ubuntu linux

121270
disk	ram
ram disk can slow down your system

121270
disk	ram
the cache gives you a lot of the advantages of a ram disk

121270
disk	ram
the more memory you allocate to other things such as a ram disk the less that s available for the cache

121270
disk	ram
and the cache speeds up pretty much everything that involves the hard disk on your pc not just the stuff you put on the ram disk

121270
disk	ram
the more ram you ve reserved the more likely your applications are to be repeatedly thrown out to disk

121270
disk	ram
this is one of the reasons why ram disk pretty much died

121270
disk	ram
back in the days when people had maybe 1mb ram ram disk were quite common though more so on ataris and amigas than on pcs

121270
disk	ram
that said a ram disk can be an advantage in special cases

121270
disk	ram
imdisk is a good virtual disk driver and the virtual disk can optionally live in system ram

you can try multiple operating systems in virtual machines such as virtualbox free vmware workstation and microsoft virtual pc

121391
ubuntu	opensuse
i m using ubuntu 9.04 - 2.6.28-18-generic though i have tried live cds of ubuntu 9.10 fedora 12 and opensuse 11.2 - all running various 2.6.31 kernels - and all received the same error

121391
ubuntu	debian
i m completely open to buying a new pci add-in card if someone can recommend one with 2 internal sata ports that works well in debian ubuntu

121407
fink	macports
i m not going to speculate but this could have been caused by any number of environment changes like the leopard - snow leopard upgrade macports or fink updates or multiple google app engine updates

121417
udp	tcp
perhaps udp would work traffic goes to .130 and comes back from .129 but i see no way for tcp to successfully make a connection on the ip that isn t routed through the server s gateway

121477
filesystems	btrfs
on the linux side zfs is not supported in the kernel only as a user-level driver but there is also a new filesystems under development called btrfs

121497
x86	64bit
you re right - in general you don t need to worry about 64bit libraries or executables unless you either a need a large address space say 2 gb or b you have a performance-critical application x86-64 has twice as many registers available as x86 and code typically runs around 30 faster

121511
ethernet	wireless
i m running a belkin-n wireless router that has an ethernet connection to my 360 and a wireless connection running to my laptop

121515
collabnet	svn

121562
mouse	keyboard
i sometimes hook up my laptop to a regular keyboard and mouse set

121574
switching	screens
it obviously can lock the screens and i will need to switching to other vt and kill it manually

121583
mouse	keyboard
once a program has access to the x server it can virtually do everything you can do with a mouse and a keyboard

121583
mouse	keyboard
there are tons of applications to help people with accessibility-related problems assisting them to use the keyboard or the mouse to control their x sessions

121593
ethernet	wireless
i have access to an ethernet port of a wireless router

121593
ethernet	wireless
i want this device to act as a kind of wireless switch - it should split the ethernet connection coming from the router to two or more computers that connect to this device via a wireless

121593
ethernet	wireless
the only thing i can do is to connect via ethernet cable to the wireless router and this does not require a password

121593
ethernet	wireless
i know what an ethernet switch is - what i need is a device which would do the same but by allowing the clients to connect to it via a wireless

121601
kde	gnome
first of all nautilus is gnome not kde

121601
folder	directory
the d tells you whether it is a directory so -rwxrwxrwx is a file while drwxrwxrwx is a folder

121601
vim	emacs
other editors that you can use in the terminal include vim vi and emacs

121601
kde	gnome
i am not familiar with how to do this using kde but in gnome you can open a file using the default application that is configured to handle it by using the command gnome-open as in

121601
anjuta	gnome
if in gnome you have registered the file extension .cpp with anjuta c++ for example then anjuta c++ will be automatically opened and launched as if you had double-clicked on myfile.cpp in nautilus

121601
vim	emacs	vim	gedit	emacs	gedit
for example i will probably always be more productive editing code with gedit than i will be with vim or emacs but launching gedit from the terminal instead of moving the mouse around is faster

121605
vim	emacs
by using a screen mode text editor such as vim emacs pico or nano

121605
vim	emacs
you navigate text by using the control key and command keys emacs pico nano or by switching from command mode to entry mode vi vim

121607
octal	hex
part generates the bom hex fe ff as octal escape sequences this is then fed to grep as its pattern prepended with match start of line

121616
mouse	keyboard
it was running fine then it just froze - all the stuff i was doing was still on the screen but mouse and keyboard input was ignored any animation that was happening on the screen stopped the machine literally just froze

121649
wan	lan
you can buy a basic wireless router with lan ports then put the cable connection that is currently in your pc into the router s wan port

121652
installation	upgrade
the ubuntu forums particularly the installation upgrade board would probably be of good use

121657
ethernet	wireless
when i connect directly via an ethernet cable the router and open up the torrent client then it seems to be doing fine but when i go wireless then the router stops working properly although all the lights are still blinking as normal

g++ v4.4 cygwin s latest gcc is gcc4-4.3.4-3 note the separate gcc4 package name

121820
vmware	virtualbox
a bit of a silly question really - but i was wondering would it be possible to take a snapshot of a os you are running on a computer the convert it or so it can be run as a virtual machine in vmware or virtualbox

121837
hindi	thai
pretty much all the text that i have read on enabling hindi complex text rendering involve enabling it via regional settings languages install files for complex script support and left to right languages including thai

there are several then you ll be able to use sip clients like ekiga or whatever the windows one is called to get skype-like voip functionality

122400
asterisk	freeswitch
there are loads of such servers like asterisk or freeswitch

122454
hash	md5
computing an md5 hash of each and every file suggested in the question and the links from answers seems to be a quite expensive way to solve the problem

122454
hash	md5
for each unique file size with more than one file associated compute the md5 of each of these and compare the hash values to spot duplicates

122457
ethernet	wireless
i have a machine which connects via ethernet to a private lan and wireless to a network which provides internet connectivity

122470

mouse	keyboard
so my main concern will i be able to extend my mouse keyboard and 2-3 monitors 10-15 feet across a room from my server rack to my desk

122508
ethernet	wireless
those features are just ways to replace a wired ethernet backhaul with a wireless one

122518
stdout	stderr	jobs	cron
most cron daemons on platforms i ve worked with automatically email the stdout stderr of user cron jobs to the user whose crontab the job came from

122518
jobs	cron
i forget what happens to system-wide non-user-specific cron jobs from etc crontab

122518
jobs	cron
if you want your jobs to write to specific log files you can use standard output redirection like honk suggested or supposing your cron job is a shell script you could have your script call logger 1 or syslog 1 or whatever other command-line tool your os provides for sending arbitrary messages to syslog

122518
jobs	cron
most of my cron jobs invoke bash scripts i wrote specifically for the purpose of being started by cron for a particular reason

122534
mouse	keyboard
i would put a cheap wired keyboard mouse and monitor at the server rack for occasional use

122537
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is where your processors pretends to have 2 physical processors cores yet only has 1 and some extra junk

122537
processors	hyperthreading
the point of hyperthreading is that many times when you are executing code in the processors there are parts of the processors that is idle

122537
cpu	processors
by including an extra set of cpu registers the processors can act like it has two cores and thus use all parts of the processors in parallel

122552
vmware	bootcamp
with a windows xp pro partition 25gb via bootcamp and vmware fusion 2.0

122553
mouse	keyboard
whichever computer you leave on more often or currently have your keyboard mouse hooked to should become the server

122567
kde	gnome
you should be able to use the print screen prtsc key on your keyboard in kde and gnome for that matter

122569
daemons	systemd
i configured the ntp daemons on mac by turning on the set date and time automatically in systemd preferences using the server s clock 127.127.1.0 as the reference clock

122571
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading makes the os think that the processors has double the number of cores and often yields a performance improvement but only in the region of 15-30 overall - though in some circumstances there may actually be a performance hit 20

122585
google-chrome	firefox
the website isn t compatible with google-chrome but it with mozilla firefox

move	drag
while i don t really miss the annoyances that go with working on windows one thing i do wish i had in gnome is the ability to hold the right-mouse button down on a file and drag it to get the context menu asking if i want to move or copy the file

123895
move	drag
i realise the default tries to be sensible like in windows - defaults to move if on the same volume or copy if on different and that it can be overridden with or - but i m still used to the right-mouse drag option and keep getting frustrated when it doesn t work.

the general method for applying proper per-user quotas is to configure a linux quota similar how-to for ubuntu 7.x on all users that access the public share

opera	firefox
to test this quickly use firefox or opera and see if it can get to it

124188
google-chrome	safari

if firefox or opera can get to it that was the problem

124188
opera	firefox
chances are if firefox opera doesn t work you ll need to disconnect from the vpn to modify your router

124202

just make sure beforehand that the package from that repository is compiled for your distro a debian binary may look for dependencies in the wrong places and for your kernel version this changes quite often throughout the life cycle of a ubuntu version

snagit is a great tool so i gave the above answer a +1 especially for collecting a series of screenshots which you can then go back and edit you don t have to edit each one and save it they are just stored by the snagit editor until you are ready you can set the default so it does not switch to the editor every time you take a screenshot so you don t interrupt your flow

124389
ubuntu	linux
given the history of issues i had with both windows and to a lesser extent ubuntu i would recommend that if you have the cpu power you run a barebone linux setup with something like vmware server on top of which you would thenrun both ubuntu and windows in parallel

124463
disk	ram
when the number of possible ram adresses is limited by the computer architecture 32 64 bit why isn t the size of the hard disk limited

124464
filesystems	ntfs
such limits can be found for the respective filesystems fat32 ntfs etc.

if you are using kde check this out if you are using gnome check this out

124645
versioning	upgrade
you might look for a way to acquire an old versioning of neooffice which i think used java instead of x11 so i m not sure it s that much better or old licenses to ms office for mac appleworks or iwork 06 06 was the last versioning to support 10.3 and that was only 10.3.9 which should be a free upgrade -- run software updates if you haven t already

124645

how about another usb keyboard or mouse specifically a different make model etc

124833
mouse	keyboard
if you do have an alternative input device frankly either mouse or keyboard is fine since you can set up either to do the work of both then use that

124953
put	get
get mercurial git put the original files under version control and then do your thing

124970
x86	64bit
in theory there are some performance benefits to 64bit in the fact that there are more general purpose registers on the chip and an x86-64 implementation explicitly implies sse2 support in a processor which immediately means that the system can be better optimised than one that is claimed to be x86 compatable and thus will not necessarily have sse support

124995
kde	gnome
but now this all needs gui with a desktop manager kde gnome for the new paradigms require gui networkmanger hal etc.

130088
folder	directory
since windows can t run the mac application and will likely add a few completely unneeded files thumbs.db etc to the directory because all mac .app files are folder that contain many files and folder i would suggest compressing your mac application into a .zip file first which will preserve the contents for when you deliver it to a suitable computer that can actually run the application

130119
kubuntu	gnome
i also have the problem using kubuntu both 9.10 and now on 10.04 beta and have found installing the network manager from gnome ubuntu makes it connect

unfortunately it looks like all the big manufacturers have moved fully to usb and ethernet wireless

130637
bluetooth	usb
i have a mini usb bluetooth dongle which i have connected to a system running windows 7

130641
affinity	processors
it sounds like the utility is tweaking processors core affinity

130641
cpu	affinity
basically in the general case it make such little difference and in cases where there are several cpu bound processes or threads that could between them use all your cpu power getting affinity wrong can slow things down by more than getting it right would help and you have all the extra computation involved in guessing what is right for the current circumstances which could kill or reverse any general benefit

130652
put	get
the actual underlying thread levels are 1-16 17-32 for kernel level code but you can t map to these directly only get put in a bin as per scheduler calculations

an external hardware with a flexible bootloader grub would work but generally harder unless you have physical access to a system already running gnu linux ubuntu or otherwise

130658
trojan	virus
i don t think google would do this sort of hijack the default browser thing and i m convinced it must be a trojan or virus or even a registry hack

130761
installation	upgrade
snow leopard by default will upgrade an installation

130761
installation	upgrade
upgrade installation don t most often cause issues but many people recommend against them because of the amount of complexity they add when dealing with issues

130761
installation	upgrade
so no an upgrade installation is not likely to introduce performance issues on mac os x but it complicates how things may have been set up potentially making it harder to find out what the issue is

131229

131302
vim	emacs
local features of emacs that are complementary to vim

131305
rar	zip
you might be better off going with zip rar to backup existing files - again just in case the windows backup itself is corrupted i m assuming the worst here

131306
versioning	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade from xp pro to windows7 pro - in xp pro and previous os versioning you could move thumbnails around in a window and they would snap shuffle up re-order themselves and be viewable as a slide show - it was unbelievably useful - i used it every day windows 7 doesn t do this

131316
sorting	grouping
usertype d and then i sort by relevant users that feature will be grouping at the end of all the other features of relevant to usertype a as it s just sorting alphabetically

131363

when prompted by the uac i have to go plug in a keyboard or mouse to be able to interact with it

131416
installation	upgrade
i thought that windows 7 s installation routine did not offer to upgrade from windows xp under any circumstances you have to do a clean install so the dvd appears to be working as it is meant to

131500
antivirus	mcafee
mcafee antivirus is notorious for slowing down pcs and many other antivirus programs drag down performance with their on-access scanning

131500
ubuntu	linux
doing a clean reinstall would also probably help but first i d recommend booting both computers from an ubuntu linux livecd and seeing how they differ in performance when they re both baselined

131519
lvm	mdadm
this server has 6 disks in a mdadm raid5 set with lvm running on top of it

131559
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried using firefox and google-chrome both are about equally slow on the netbook

131560

131568
folder	directory
i have a folder containing shortcuts that point to files that are located in various directory and drives

131616
filesystems	ntfs
edit upon re-reading the question you can mount the ntfs drive in linux using the ntfs-3g filesystems driver

if you are on virtual machine like virtualbox or vmware then consult your manuals to see how its down

131625

131635
portrait	landscape
i usually run one in landscape at 1280x1024 and the other one in portrait at 1024x1280 as they are the same size but i have no problem if i change the resolution of one display independently of the other 768x1024 works fine it just looks giant on the portrait screen

131711
debian	linux
i have just switched from an old fedora core server to debian linux v5.0.4

131712
daemons	launchd
the startup scripts on most linux distributions handle this by saving the process id of the service daemons when they launchd it

131769

the only other thing i can think about is it might not go into s3 if you have a mouse or even a usb keyboard connected to it

131770

everything is doing great but there is a problem with email web clients the most popular ones gmail yahoo hotmail are not optimized for screen readers

131882
put	get
i create a few files notes passwords etc and put links on the task bar so i can get to them quickly

but you might find something like evernote or microsoft onenote if you have ms ms-office to be even more useful

131890
sudo	passwd
type sudo update-grub enter your passwd and wait for it to finish

131893
freebsd	debian
i currently have debian installed but i m very interested in freebsd because of zfs i really really like its file integrity features

131911
ubuntu	linux
for linux i m thinking of something like ubuntu or fedora but not rhel if that matters.

131929
opensolaris	bsd
the zfs filesystem in opensolaris was the deciding factor over linux bsd for me when i recently built a file server

131984
disk	ram
i put in power supply installed processor on motherboard installed heatsink put in ram and i am using an older ide hard disk

132028
geany	notepad++	kate	kde	kate	gnome	kate	geany	kde	gnome
if you want something similar to notepad++ look ate kate for kde or geany for gnome

132060
kate	kde	kate	gnome	kate	gedit	kde	gnome
if that matters gedit is a gtk application and kate is a qt one but this doesn t mean you have to have gnome or kde in order of these to work

132076
put	get
my cpu was heating up to around 65 deg c and last time this had happened about a year ago i got thermal paste put between the cpu and heat sink and this managed to get it down to about 45 - 50 degrees

132119
daemons	launchd
i ve got an init script setup to launchd emacs daemons and i can run emacsclient from the terminal

132119
daemons	launchd
however i d like to be able to launchd an emacs gui that connects to the daemons from gnome-do

132128
daemons	launchd
you could write a user launchd daemons which runs when a filesystem is mounted

132128
daemons	launchd
in summary you need to use the startonmount key in your launchd daemons

132135
folder	directory
the spooling directory can be seen in the spool folder textbox

132140
switching	screens
or you can use screens and switching tabs with ctrl - a n and ctrl - a p or ctrl - a 0-9 to switching directly to one

132142
width	height
i m guessing this happens whenever height or width is larger than 1024 but i seem to recall perhaps erroneously exceptions to this rule

132146
kde	gnome
for the most part do uses what xdg to find out what to do with files so if you use a desktop environment gnome or kde you can set the preferred application to emacsclient -n -g for the typical filetypes in there and do should pick it up

132153
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
my advice is to try mandriva or maybe linux mint derivated from ubuntu

132169
folder	directory
whenever i configure a virtual host in the default folder it works however when i configure the virtual host in my home directory i get a 403 forbidden error

i m using cdex for converting wav to mp3 and want to ask you guys what version to use

132353
mouse	keyboard
yes it is philosophically goofy to use keyboard shifts to alter the behavior of mouse clicks but it has been that way since before windows existed

132372
x86	64bit
amd64 is the 64bit compilation for 64bit x86 processors but most people use the 32 bit version even if they are running a 64bit os

132373
x86	64bit
to find out if you are running x86 32bit or x64 64bit just goto control panel - system and if it doesn t say you are running 64bit then you are running 32bit

132373
x86	64bit
download the x86 version if you have 64bit download the win64-amd64 version

132373
x86	64bit
although the other comments straight out say to download and install x86 there can be compatibility issues with running 32bit programs in a 64bit os i have seen them first hand

132377
ubuntu	linux
i ve recently installed the latest version of chrome for linux on my ubuntu 9.10 installation

132425

on my linux box gentoo linux 2.6.31 to be specific i have noticed that the hostname environment variable is available in my shell but not in scripts

132588
put	get
even better look for the service tag on the back bottom and put that in here to get your exact machine s details

132611
google-chrome	firefox
i was curious if there was an equivalent technique in google-chrome to do address bar param string replacement like you can do in firefox

132614

under virtualbox vmware or parallels

132743
cpu	processors
my processors is an intel r pentium r d cpu 3.00ghz

132773
vmware	virtualbox
the other option and imo the better option is to install a primary os i would choose w7 in this case and use a vm manager like virtualbox or vmware to create vms for all additional oses as many as you want

132810
wan	lan
a variety of users on our lan would like to listen to an mms stream and in the interest of conserving bandwidth and because our wan connection is not fast at all i was wondering if it was possible to set up a service which proxies the stream from the wan and provides it to lan computers thus only downloading the stream once and then distributing it to clients

132815
firefox	safari
as i mentioned before they are native to safari thus no need for 3rd party programs like scrapbook for firefox and webarchives are better than firefox s or ie s save as html complete because the webarchive is a single file with all the goodies all packed inside of it

132842
ethernet	wireless
i m likely to get different ips from time to time and i can t really use a dedicated ip for the machine since the ips are assigned by mac address and the wireless card has a different mac address than the ethernet port

132856
pecl	pear
alternatively could i install phpize in some other way via pear or pecl

132862
opera	firefox
i don t know about firefox but opera provides a meter of total uploaded data as well as transfer rate i think it also has percentage but it s been a while

132865
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i have installed linux mint 8 based on ubuntu

132878
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian
actually this for debian but as mint is based on ubuntu and ubuntu is based on debian this should work

132916
wav	ogg	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
so go look for mp3 wav ogg files on your pc which resembles the sound you re experiencing delete rename move it so the program playing it will crash throw an error

132926
ssd	sata
for instance the new velociraptors are head and shoulders over typical 7200rpm sata hard drives but even these figures pale into insignificant when you compare them to the top end ssd s

132927
rss	feed
i can check the number of subscribers on google reader for my two feed rss and atom

132967
ubuntu	linux
i use thunderbird on ubuntu linux and have just upgraded to ubuntu 10 thunderbird 3

132968
trojan	virus
one thing to note is that when i downloaded the dropbox installer and opened it up panda cloud antivirus detected a suspicious file which was csrss.exe and neutralized it. however an actual virus or trojan was not detected immediately before the file was detected and neutralized

132978
put	get
i then put the hard disk back in it s laptop restarted with the windows cd and tried to get into the recovery console but i forgot the password and can t log on to the drive

132981
ubuntu	linux
alternatively you can follow what is being done in the official linux community ubuntu red hat etc by using the mpx+multitouchd driver to the xorg

132991

if you would like to try linux ubuntu is one of the easiest to get started on

132993

dreamweaver	fireworks
prototype in fireworks and then export standards-compliant css layouts with external style sheets for completion in dreamweaver

133051
dreamweaver	fireworks
you don t have to use dreamweaver but given that you re using fireworks it might be easier if you do

133083
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading exposes multiple logical cores for a single physical cpu core

133083
cpu	hyperthreading
in simple terms hyperthreading makes context-switching more efficient for each cpu core

133091
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is where your processors pretends to have 2 physical processors cores yet only has 1 and some extra junk

133091
processors	hyperthreading
the point of hyperthreading is that many times when you are executing code in the processors there are parts of the processors that is idle

133091
cpu	processors
by including an extra set of cpu registers the processors can act like it has two cores and thus use all parts of the processors in parallel

133113
google-chrome	firefox
when i want to have separate cookies i usually run ie along with google-chrome and firefox

133151
folder	directory
despite the fact that most applications can be installed by dragging them to the applications directory some software still requires the creation of a separate program folder

133151
folder	directory
is the applications directory special somehow or is it just a convenient folder with a custom icon

133161
put	get
i put the sp3 disk back in trying to get the repair option i didn t ever see putting in the sp1 disk and it tried to continue the sp1 install - on the 4th step and then gave the same signature error above

133176
ssl	https
one interesting thing i noticed is that if i modify the google reader url to not use ssl change https to http it renders without any issues

133190
folder	directory
if you create a folder applications in your home directory it will get the same icon

133191
google-chrome	firefox
i remember there was an addon for firefox to do this it also points to this link however this isn t for google-chrome

133399
rar	zip
and now when ever i try to restore a directory the rar zip files are copied to the system hard drive instead of extracting their contents to the hard drive

133399
rar	zip
my alternative is to write a program that traverses the folders on the external drive and extracts files from the rar zip files

133410
ubuntu	linux
server software should run on windows or linux not sure about ubuntu and the client software is java based

133433
wan	lan
you will see an improvement with lan wlan traffic but you will not see any difference between your wlan to wan speeds

133435
google-chrome	firefox
i had already had an account set up through both internet explorer and firefox but i recently had switched to google-chrome

133437
mutt	msmtp
much better is subjective to configure something like esmtp or msmtp or maybe nullmailer to relay email through gmail s servers and then let mutt use the standard usr bin sendmail way of sending messages

133442
kde	gnome
kde gnome etc

133457
vim	emacs
my years of habit in windows have imprinted on me that ctrl+x cut ctrl+c copy and ctrl+v paste everywhere including vim and emacs

133468
hash	md5
you could instead use a timestamp or a proper hash md5 but this fix sufficed for my purpose

133472

in ie and google-chrome it works as usual but in firefox it hangs in the loading screen and never finishes

133503
toolbar	tabs
new tabs can t get rid of toolbar etc

but then besides hitting browse... button to choose the folder and exe be sure the checkbox in that first screen which says use allways this software to open... something like that is checked

133838
rss	feed
from reading around the web it looks like firefox s quick view of an rss feed sometimes lets you subscribe to this feed using thunderbird

133840
rss	feed
because of course you add an rss feed in mail mode..

133842

133886
vim	textmate

133924
lan	intranet
the preset is not important i chose lan intranet

133947
filesystems	ntfs
on modern filesystems like ntfs it shouldn t cause problems

133947
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is called journaling filesystems which means that when improperly unmounting the drive for example if you turn off the computer or the os unexpectedly crashes it will restore to a stable place when starting the os again

133947
filesystems	fat
on older non-journaling filesystems like fat the os can t repair the filesystems automatically

133990
mouse	keyboard
however in my case i ve noticed that switching the keyboard and mouse from one port to another and then back to the same port that didn t work initially somehow solves the issue

134011
filesystems	ntfs
it stores the main copy of the filesystems table on ntfs filesystems

134087

134286
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
this is more pronounced when using a server version of linux like ubuntu server edition or centos

134286
unix	bsd
so if you plan on a ton of users on your website at once with lots of database transactions or a heavy duty web app or are using older hardware go with linux or a bsd unix

134301
hide	show
i do not know to which extent this can still be done in newer versions but the way i did it on the version that i m using was by going to the messenger menu show hide unchecked everything but status chooser for an even more compact view this can be unchecked as well

134339
filesystems	ntfs
inconvenient though is that dynamic volumes must use the ntfs filesystems so if you want to create one you ll need to a create the volume on a windows computer and b install macfuse and ntfs-3g on any mac you want to access the volume

134358
versioning	upgrade
i looked everywhere in bios even upgrade it to the most recent versioning but found nothing that would have said raid and the operating system i wish to install sees the two hdds not just a raided one

134567
ubuntu	linux
rather than leaving it up to the user to track down installer files and keep applications updated ubuntu like many other linux distributions has a software package management system that provides a searchable database of easily installable applications like an online shopping cart but the software is cost-free which it will download and install for you with a few clicks

134616
disk	ram
on seven i see no progress bar and the monitor turn off at once while the os saves the ram on the disk

134626
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox can run vms created by vmware workstation or server for this you need to import vmdk files using the following procedure

134635
ubuntu	linux
i have a compaq presario r4000 running ubuntu linux 9.10 karmic

134641
vmware	bootcamp
unless you ve got very custom peripherals you need to keep using vmware supports usb 2.0 passthrough - nobody supports 1394 the power of either of those virtualization products may be enough and you might not need bootcamp

134649
x86	64bit
i currently have a little app tied to our own little 64bit os that tells you the processor name and the type x86 32bit or x64 64bit here 6kb download

from my experience i have reverted to xp on my mac to save battery life and once installed through bootcamp i run using parallels desktop to run the same boot virtually

134693
vim	emacs
a better way is to learn a powerful editor like vim emacs and edit in place

134702
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian the package is named xfonts-terminus

134839
vim	emacs
finally if you want something less integrated but use separate tools the unix way you should pick a good editor vim and emacs come to mind both have good integration with various tools such as version control and compiler plus a debugger

134880
filesystems	ntfs
write access to ntfs filesystems

134893
cpu	processors
the pentium d uses 2 netburst architecture cpu cores on separate dies two chips one package each with a small cache sharing a single quad pumped front side bus of 533 or 800 mt s throughput 4 x 100mhz x 2 double data rate for desktop processors

134893
cpu	processors
the core 2 duo processors have two core 2 architecture cpu cores on a single die often sharing a large 2nd level cache up to 12mb in size

134893
processors	hyperthreading
all core 2 duo processors are 64 bit and none support hyperthreading

134921
vim	emacs
as a long time vim user i m fairly surprised that emacs cannot scroll smoothly by itself

134934
disk	ram
unless you are concerned that you might not have enough ram so will regularly be swapping to disk i would suggest putting the project work on the faster drive

135071
pop-up	dialog
whenever i plug in a usb device windows live messenger pop-up the dialog box

135098
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
for icmp query reply type messages like echoes pings napt uses the icmp query id sometimes just called the icmp id the same way it would use a tcp or udp port number

135098
udp	tcp
this doesn t conflict with any tcp or udp mapping because in a good napt implementation the protocol is one of the pieces of information held in the nat table entry to make it unique

135134
ethernet	wireless
from some instructions found on the net i made it an access point so it connects to the wireless network and then provides an ethernet connection to whichever device i want to connect

135148
ubuntu	linux
if you interested in paid solution try nero for linux which supports ubuntu and other linux flavours

135153
bash	zsh
you didn t specify which shell but assuming bash or zsh

135186
spaces	delimiter
so the just make sure that in the options delims is last if you leave a spaces for before the closing quote then you will get spaces as a delimiter

135186
spaces	delimiter
for example if you want the 1st 3rd and 4th fields delimiter by a spaces the options would be tokens 1 3 4 delims to access those you pull them out of i j and k

135211
jobs	cron
it helps to consider the case when other users have their own processes running concurrently with yours such as via fast user switching or sshing into the box from somewhere else or cron or launchd jobs

135224
google-chrome	firefox
i do have firefox installed which is not subject to the same group policy push but i need to have ie8 and google-chrome working

135262
jobs	cron
i figured it how to log my cron job activity without switching each one over to launchd jobs

135296
put	get
i added the dots in the code above because i can t get .code blocks spans to let me put the html code here.

135311
sudo	passwd
kde just tells me that i don t have permission to do that but doesn t give me the option of entering the root passwd or sudo

135313

if still same concern unplug keyboard and mouse as well but do not unplug monitor cable

135314
versioning	upgrade
has anyone with the same sort of promotional versioning managed to upgrade successfully

in windows mapping a network drive and storing files directly to a folder in the network drive from firefox google-chrome downloads is a breeze

135324
folder	directory
there will be a directory for the folder you just connected

135338
vpn	lan
when i connect to the vpn i automatically start sending dns requests for .myhomedomain.com to my home nameserver but any other requests continue to go the the nameserver i was using before the one i received on my company lan via dhcp

135338
vpn	lan
when i disconnect the vpn requests for .myhomedomain.com go back to the local lan dns server all requests are going there now

135345
bluetooth	usb
first plugin the phone with the usb cable don t know how to do it via bluetooth

135382
daemons	launchd
see also creating launchd daemons and agents

135385
bluetooth	usb
the only solution i came up with was to just use the bluetooth usb dongle and ditch the charging station

135444
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko	firefox	safari
note that whatever browser you use the actual screenshot will always be created using webkit just like safari and google-chrome do but different from firefox s gecko

135444
firefox	safari
to resize the browser window for that i use the following bookmarklet which for some browsers might apply to the inner format but for safari and firefox refers to the outer size

135464
google-chrome	safari
windmill created a proxy that google-chrome and safari follow

135477
bash	zsh
shells in the bourne family bash zsh ksh etc. in â œloginâ mode will run etc profile which usually completely resets path to a new value also per-user shell initialization files will usually add various other directories to the path

135526
rss	feed
to add an rss feed you will have to manually edit the .theme file

jobs	cron
to see if they are cron jobs ..

135586
ati	nvidia
i notice most of the recent nvidia and ati amd cards have dual-dvi ports

trojan	virus
ok that was obviously some virus trojan whatever

135676
ubuntu	linux
i have two computer at home running ubuntu linux

135701

you can enable ssh access using sshd or usr sbin sshd -p 1337 to listen to a non-privileged port hence not requiring a sudo passwd

135722
restrict	shared
you can then setup some network shared and restrict access based on groups

135774

135774

rar	zip
while i m not 100 about actually password-protecting a folder you could zip or rar the folder and password-protect it

versioning	upgrade
lts versioning have the advantage that you can upgrade from lts to lts every two years where non-lts versioning have to be updated incrementally which means two times a year

135898
udp	tcp
check the documentation for your client to see what udp tcp ports it needs and open them up forward them to the machine running the torrent client

135921
octal	hex
if i want to know how different they are or where they re different one thing that works is to crank them both through od octal dump which usually has a hex option to make temporary files and then diff those

135951
sorting	grouping
even worse the files really are mostly named photo1.jpg - so simply putting them all in the same folder sorting by size and deleting in grouping would not work without renaming already and if it s possible i d prefer to keep them in their folders

135955
width	height
to grab the width and height of an image with identify

135961
mouse	keyboard
x can already do this sort of thing by setting up two different x servers with different configurations for the screen keyboard and mouse

if the ram passes add each device back in one at a time starting with your boot disk

135968
mouse	keyboard
i would like to have some kind of statistic of my daily mouse keyboard usage to help me make my keyboard layout a little bit more efficient

135968
mouse	keyboard
another thing i already found is key-mon a little program for screencasts that displays your mouse and keyboard presses on the screen which would help me achieve what i want with a little bit of python coding by myself

xfce	gnome
i know it just came out today but are there any statistics with memory requirements system resources power usage and performance to decide which is better xubuntu or ubuntu xfce vs gnome

136112

ubuntu	freebsd
as suggested by the title i want to change cpu actually i have two computers one with ubuntu running on an amd athlon 64 dual core 5200+ and the other with freebsd running on an amd sempron single core le-1250

136151
ubuntu	freebsd
i would like to swap i am not sure that this is the correct term... the cpus from one computer to the other one that is take the dual core from the ubuntu pc and put it inside the freebsd pc and viceversa

136154
ubuntu	freebsd
should be fine at least on the ubuntu side i don t use freebsd often so my opinion there is worthless as long as you re not moving from 32bit to 64bit and it might work then but i ve never tried it

136158
logmein	hamachi
look into virtual networking solutions like logmein s hamachi

136162
bash	tcsh

136175
versioning	upgrade
so now the question becomes how does one upgrade a client-created 1.4.3 repo to a 1.6.x compatible versioning without access to the underlying machine the repo resides on

136246
filesystems	ntfs
for example if you have two ntfs volumes mapped to c and d you could instead create an empty folder called say c data and unassign the drive letter d and map that filesystems to c data

136248
tunnel	vpn
on windows the default configuration is to send all traffic down the vpn connection the tunnel even if it is destined for sites external to the private network

136248

i ve upgrade from windows xp to windows 7 64bit and i found that the very convenient sunbelt kerio personal firewall will not work on this versioning

installation	upgrade
i ve installed that package and i ve discovered that aptitude dist-upgrade now wants to upgrade a lot of packages on my system that weren t ready for upgrade prior to the installation of the getdeb package

136768
versioning	upgrade
so i gather that the default behaviour is now to upgrade all packages to the versioning available at getdeb

136768
versioning	upgrade
with the preferences file set up as noted aptitude dist-upgrade won t try to upgrade packages to their getdeb versioning

136768
versioning	upgrade
at this point i m looking for a convenient way to upgrade a package to the getdeb versioning or to the most recent versioning either is okay and upgrade install dependencies as required

136768
versioning	upgrade
i usually do this stuff from the command line but i found that i needed to go into the curses versioning of aptitude in order to upgrade a package to a specific versioning

136768
versioning	upgrade
within aptitude i had to select the desired versioning of the desired package for upgrade and then deal with conflicts created because of that package versioning s dependencies on newer versioning of other packages

136768
versioning	upgrade
i did this and was prompted to confirm upgrade of the depended-upon package rosegarden-data to the versioning provided by getdeb

136769
hash	md5
as simon stevens said they usually come with a hash though i have noticed a lot actually come with a md5 hash which has proven weaknesses

136769
hash	md5
it s best to check if they have a sha-2 hash they are much more secure than md5 and if something like md4 is used just don t trust it at all

136781
16-bit	64bit
although i ve used 8-bit chips for the examples the same basic principles apply to 16-bit 32-bit or 64bit chips

it is available as bsdtar on some linux distributions debian gnu linux ubuntu and some rpm-based distributions but looking at the code i am sure that invocation will just cause an â œoption --strip-components is not permitted in mode -câ error

fat	hfs+
any modern os can work with the fat partition but mac files do better with the hfs+ partition

vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
oh and if you want to use it parallels is very good the vms run much faster than virtualbox and a fair bit faster than vmware fusion

137003
ubuntu	linux
firstly ubuntu includes a program called wubi which will create a large file on the window s disk and use it as a filesystem for linux

137012
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux	put	get
not sure about 10.04 but i know linux mint ubuntu based has gparted live in the distro already so that from the live usb you can simply change the partitions to get some free space to put ubuntu on without destroying the partitions that windows is currently on

137043
put	get
and i get a great deal of satisfaction out of using something that i put together myself

137045
debian	linux
a minimal install of debian isn t really very big although not as small as damn small linux and you can easily add a compile environment to that just add the gcc make and libc6-dev packages

137058
mouse	keyboard
the mouse cursors and insertion points could have different colors to tell them apart but when you click to start typing somewhere which keyboard gets the input

137089
bazaar	git
use rsync oh wait you would need rsync on the server as well to just store the mercurial git bazaar repos from your local machine onto the servers

137105

the system cursors folder is in your windows directory

137408
google-chrome	firefox
i wonder if there is any browser plugin for firefox or google-chrome that for a webpage shows the timestamp it was written or updated

137456

if not and debugging this issue on an ongoing basis you could set up auditd and a cron job with ps to log system activity and what jobs are running on a continuous basis

137472
ubuntu	linux
if you just want a machine that works and do not care if its a windows machine then download ubuntu linux

137489
ethernet	wireless
quitting dhclient dhclient -q i think and doing ifdown ethx and then ifup ethx where ethx is replaced by your actually network device eth0 for first ethernet port may be wlan0 or similiar for wireless may fix the problem for you

google-chrome	firefox
i just upgraded to lucid and now flash won t work in google-chrome though it works in firefox

yes do kbd alt kbd + kbd f2 kbd type update-manager -c and the update manager will offer you to upgrade your ubuntu versioning

137917
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
use software like vmware fusion parallels or virtualbox to create the virtual machine

138045
post	get
if that doesn t work please post the literal error messages you get when trying to do so and the output of running

138063
ubuntu	linux
if it s just a simple web site yes then you can install some flavor of linux or you can use windows somehow a quick ubuntu lamp install seems about right in this case including apache as a web server

138075
fink	macports
or use macports or fink commander to install sqlite package

138083
vmware	virtualbox
i m not familiar enough with windows xp mode to know why this would be a problem but you could still use a different virtualization platform such as vmware or virtualbox

138100
disk	ram
you could use the remaining memory as a ram disk

138127
filesystems	fat
on windows the .emacs file may be called _emacs for backward compatibility with dos and fat filesystems where filenames could not start with a dot

138133

the best virtual machine software is probably vmware or virtualbox

138173

google-chrome	firefox
for example for this very page in firefox i can search firefox lik and this page s address shows up in firefox but not in google-chrome

138218

the question apt seems to prompt for is based on the results of dpkg that knows what files are going to be updated and checking those files for local changes how i don t know

i understand there are options for macs to read write ntfs filesystems and also for pcs to read write hfs+ filesystems

x86	64bit
this solved my devcon closing problem but after solving that issue i realized that devcon is broken for 64bit windows 7 on a x86 architecture..

138333
debian	linux
if the debian install cd is giving you too much trouble but you can boot to a linux livecd almost any will do consider installing debian from linux

138334
hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
if the hard drive is going to remain plugged into one computer or the other and shared over the network for the other computer s use then use whichever the best filesystems for that computer is ntfs for windows hfs+ for mac

138334
filesystems	hfs+
the ntfs-3g driver for macfuse is fairly mature and without boot camp you are going to have a tough time getting windows to recognize hfs+ filesystems

138340
folder	directory
ie will save the file to a temporary directory then copy yes copy the file to the folder you want

138342
octal	hex
the docs seem to say that if i set nrformats to octal hex alpha which i am trying to do with then will increment a to b 007 to 010 and 0x09 to 0x0f but those examples are not working for me i just a get a beep for a 007 turns into 008 and 0x09 turns into 0x10

138412
vmware	virtualbox
in sun virtualbox i created a new virtual machine and pointed it at the vddx file from vmware

138450
sorting	filtering
another option might be to make an ms access linked table pointed to the file if you need to do some querying sorting filtering

138485
vmware	virtualbox
you can use virtual machines using vmware virtualbox or virtualpc or others but these are the main options

138486
vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate
the one thing i would improve about textmate would be to give it a command insert mode like vim odd because the thing is inspired by emacs and give it better large file handling ability

138515
vim	gedit
editor - vim gvim if you know want to know how to use it or gedit which comes as default

138522

138613

i had a look in the home folder i cheated by using the knavigator in ubuntu and there are no folders there - which presumably mean that no users have been set up as yet in the debian system

138613
ubuntu	debian
copy my projects from the ubuntu system to the debian system

138615
ubuntu	debian
many debian developers and probably ubuntu too use chroots for a simpler way to get a separate filesystem for development

138615
ubuntu	debian
you use debrootstrap to create your debian or ubuntu filesystem then use schroot to help manage and enter the chroot

138615
filesystems	btrfs
you could also check out the snapshot features of the new btrfs filesystems

138620
filesystems	ntfs
to create it you only need to format it with the ntfs filesystems in a windows vista or windows 7 system and then copy the whole content of the windows installation media on it

memory controllers bus widths range from 8-bit in earlier systems to 512-bit in more complicated systems and video cards typically implemented as four 64bit simultaneous memory controllers operating in parallel though some are designed to operate in gang mode where two 64bit memory controllers can be used to access a 128bit memory device

what i don t understand is the pull vs fetch and the push

139194

push and pull are specific to decentralized version control systems

139216

normally you use it with a keyboard mouse - when you move the cursor of the side of the screen you are then controlling a second computer

i use virtualbox vm s for commercial work all day every day and see no reason to pay for fusion or parallels

if the data has low redundancy to start with for instance the archive contains images files in a format that is compressed natively gif jpg png ... then gzip may add not further compression at all

139273
tar	gunzip
if compressed content is a tar file containing many many small files you might find that noticeably more disk space is required to unpack the full archive but in most circumstances the count returned from piping gunzip output through wc is going to be as accurate as you need

however there are a lot of things that zsh does differently or that bash can t do at all

since you re using 192.168.1 24 for your wireless interface you should use something else for your wired ethernet interface

143662
ubuntu	debian
i m using backup2l to backup my debian server afaik ubuntu is a derivate of debian

143676
put	get
not knowing anything about sas do i need to replace the 73gb with the 147gb and restore from a backup or can i put the drive in the machine and get the controller to treat the two drives as one large one

143702
sudo	passwd
all you need is access to the bootloader or a livecd sudo su - mount root device somewhere chroot passwd voila.

the mouse and keyboard both work fine when i boot into mac os x

143766
ubuntu	linux
is it even possible to install a software on ubuntu linux

143774
mouse	keyboard
now i know this method is mouse as opposed to keyboard but it does replicate the same functionality somewhat from what i can tell from your updated q never used mac myself just a different means of getting to it

143787
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your java versioning because mozilla disables older versioning of java plug-in in firefox

143788

there are a number of open source software projects that create software that allows you to control multiple computers using just the keyboard and mouse of one of the computers

143875
cpu	hyperthreading	put	get
at this point using a 64-bit distro is rather like enabling hyperthreading on your cpu - you get a free performance boost for your pc and if that means you can put off upgrading it for another six months then it s an easy win

143878
mouse	keyboard
i can connect from windows to ubuntu with any combination but there is no screen refresh i can drag a window on ubuntu using my mouse in windows or type into a terminal in ubuntu from my keyboard in windows but the image does not change on windows

143897

ethernet	wireless
all you need to do is go to network connections in the control panel of your laptop then highlight your wireless adapter and your ethernet adapter at the same time then right click one of them and select bridge connections

143922
ethernet	wireless
it takes a few minutes to make the bridge but once complete all you have to do is connect an ethernet line between your server and your laptop and make sure your laptop is connected wireless to the router and you are good

143933
terminate	timeout
normally the processes will terminate upon disconnection but the old ssh sessions could either be waiting to timeout or they could have hung upon exit due to a race condition

144059
mouse	keyboard
the virtual environment is displayed in the connected monitor and the other user uses it using the extra keyboard mouse and the monitor but without interfering my screen

144088
wan	lan
1 use a different router for your pc which can bear the load and pass the wan to your pc from the first router so wan - routera wifi+wife+phone - routerb simple lan - yourpc

144091
mouse	keyboard
you couldn t just attach the keyboard mouse to your laptop as that would interfere

144091
mouse	keyboard
this would allow your friend to control the vm with a second keyboard mouse plugged into your system

144091
mouse	keyboard
you could look into kvm-over-ip hardware which would allow you to plug your keyboard mouse and even the monitor into the network and control the vm over the local ethernet but the price you ll pay for that you could buy multiple replacement pcs

144091
mouse	keyboard
also synergy is a tool that allows keyboard mouse control over a network but your friend would still require a pc to plug his keyboard mouse into to be able to control the vm over the network but that would then defeat the point for your requirements

144091
post	get
i d be really interested to hear if you manage to get this working - definitely post back if you figure anything out

144096
ftp	telnet	putty	winscp

should i resize vista partition first to make room for linux installation or should i upgrade first to windows 7 and resize partitions after upgrade

144108
filesystems	ntfs
you can t use fsck on a ntfs filesystems

144110
folder	directory
you have a file url ie and you want to see other images from the same folder but when you go to the parent directory somefolder you get a message that file listings are not allowed or similar or you get shown some web page rather than a listing of the files you are interested in

144172
google-chrome	firefox
although ie may use a wrapper of sorts thus isolating the main process from those that process untrusted data for added security as google-chrome does this is moot as in the above described methods all components of firefox are isolated from tampering with the system

144172
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is still allowed to drop files into temporary folders and potentially executables as are google-chrome and ie

144172
google-chrome	firefox	folder	directory
in no way is allowing firefox to write to its own directory and temporary folder any different from what protected mode google-chrome and protected mode ie are allowed to do

144173
cpu	processors
cpu clock speed only matters when comparing otherwise essentially identical processors

144197
ubuntu	linux
no point in reinstalling windows 2000 so i installed an ubuntu 9.0 linux on the laptop

144197
cpu	processors
there s apparantly a little disk activity occuring about every 5 seconds and the processors must be chewing up cycles as the cpu fan comes on an stays on

144212

i use google-chrome firefox and flashget to download all show the same problem

at least for itunes it treats the mp3 as one file and then adds the mp3 to its playlist again when it finds it in an m3u

144444
google-chrome	firefox
the website generates a timeout on every single web browser i ve tried ie8 firefox and google-chrome

144444
traceroute	nmap
however traceroute nmap and telnet all work just fine

144446
freebsd	solaris
if you store your files on zfs either locally with open solaris or freebsd or remotely if you run any other os you might do a snapshot every interval you like and then do a differential incremental send to your backup platform

144448
cpu	processors
why should i buy a xeon processors for a server why don t use instead a simple intel quad 4-core cpu for a desktop pc

144453
ubuntu	debian
i would like the debian guest to be able to hit my webserver running on my ubuntu host for example i just type in the browser under debian

for get this working i coppied all rpm s from all 7 discs to repository centos that i was created before that i summed all contents of trans.tbl files from all discs in centos directory to one file and saved it in repository centos trans.tbl after this i put the importest directory named repodata from first disc media centos_5.4_final repodata to repository repodata

144526
disk	ram
i don t have any hard and fast numbers but i believe that the max read time for a standard spinning hard disk is something like 50 gb sec ssd is 300 gb sec ram is pretty much instant

144527
udp	tcp	afp	smb
- does pure tcp or udp data transfers without the overhead of say a remote volume mounting protocol like smb or nfs or afp beats the heck out of timing a file copy

144529
tunnel	packets
the modem doesn t see packets destined for it because they re being sent through the pppoe tunnel

144529
arp	tcp
after the arp request a tcp connection is established with the normal syn syn ack ack process

144529
arp	tcp
i thought about it and it seems to me that i can t just allow tcp packets in on the wan from 192.168.0.254 i also need to allow arp response packets how else could pfsense find the mac address of the hardware it s trying to send an ip packet to

144529
wan	lan
it also occurred to me that i can t say lan as the destination because it s actually the wan interface that s pinging

144532

be sure to restrict traffic to not include pppoe lan wan

pulseaudio	mixer
pulseaudio is a software mixer on top of the userland like you d run an app

144705
installation	upgrade
i know you can t actually use the built-in upgrade installation path

144705
versioning	upgrade
or do upgrade versioning of windows function only when executed from inside the os and not when doing fresh installs

144715
ubuntu	linux
i have just updated my ubuntu linux to ubuntu 10.4 not my grub menu isnt letting me boot to windows partition

144716

have you run a virus trojan scan

144753
ubuntu	linux
i m going to be installing ubuntu on a new silent desktop as my latest and hopefully last attempt to switch from windows to linux for at least most everyday tasks

144753
cpu	processors
it s a 64-bit processors and i m maxing the board out at 4gb of ram hey that 1.6 cpu needs all the help it can get which naturally raises the question of whether to install ubuntu 64-bit or 32-bit and if the latter either live with the missing ram or do the pae kernel dance

144835
rss	feed
it was a screensaver that like rss feed brought in all your favorite sources with news articles and stock quotes along with various other info and turned it into a visually interesting screensaver

144844
ubuntu	debian
i d like to install ubuntu server or maybe debian on a 8 16gb usb flash drive

144852
disk	ram
another option may be to use lubuntu instead of ubuntu desktop or unr this creates a more minimal system using less disk space and using less ram and cpu resource by default but you can still install all the full-fat apps like openoffice if you need them - even after adding a few of these the space used may be noticeably smaller than a default unr install

144918
wan	lan
most routers have built-in 10 100 or gigabit switches but if you want to use your existing gigabit switch just plug one of the router s lan not wan internet ports into one of the ports on the gigabit switch

144953
put	get
once you get the ebuild you should put it into a local overlay which is also reasonably easy

144968
mouse	keyboard
currently i am trying to run virtualbox on my second monitor with a dedicated mouse and keyboard

there has been times where the mouse works but not the keyboard vice versa or nothing works at all

when enabling the usb mouse and keyboard from the vm i get an error usb device is busy with a previous request. the only thing that is using second mouse and keyboard however is windows

144968

keyboard auto-capture is disabled and while a solution i was reading online stated to turn off mouse integration that option is grayed out on my machine

antivirus spyware software for mac required necessary

144995
vmware	virtualbox
unfortunately vmware does have problems importing virtual appliances created in virtualbox otherwise the process would be quite easy

145001
chown	chmod
this will ensure that the file is owned by user u1 chown and group u1 assuming that user u1 s default group is u1 and that only that user can read the file chmod

145009
put	get
i have a 3rd monitor to put there but i m not sure how to get the computer to recognize it

i m also considering switching to a bigger center screens which is currently 20

145033
processors	hyperthreading
my i7 is a quad core processors but has hyperthreading which does actually help here btw so it shows as 8

145039
kde	gnome
on unix systems you get an api framework x11 x window system for which exist multiple implementations xorg xfree86 on top of which you get various higher level api frameworks gtk+ qt ... because raw x11 is so primitive on top of which you get various desktops gnome kde ... all done by different people

145039
kde	gnome
it s perfectly possible to use qt apps on a gnome desktop or gtk+ apps on a kde desktop it wasn t always like that so you have to worry little about compatibility

145043
mouse	keyboard
process events mouse keyboard exposure motion etc

145057
ethernet	wireless
this will be either 100 1000 mb s for ethernet or 54mb s for wireless

all of the compression algorithms i ve used recently zip rar 7z tar bzip2 are i o bound not cpu bound

145156
subscript	superscript
as superscript or subscript

ethernet	wireless
because my wireless router s ethernet ports are defective i set up a shared wireless connection from my laptop which has wifi to my emac which does not via a crossover ethernet cable

145188
udp	tcp
there s a game i want to play that needs port 6112 forwarded both tcp and udp in order to host games

145234
ethernet	wireless
note that the imac either needs to be connected via ethernet or to be new enough to have implemented wake on wireless lan

145274
ubuntu	linux
for live linux well just have a ubuntu disk

145285
ubuntu	linux
make the os ubuntu linux treat that directory as the default home

145314
vmware	virtualbox
i would create an empty vmware vmdk disk and add that as a second hard disk to the virtual machine in virtualbox then use whatever tool to copy the disk from within the virtualbox virtual machine

145314
vmware	virtualbox
then release the vmdk disk from the virtualbox virtual machine and attach it to a new vmware machine

145316
mouse	trackpad
i have an usb radio mouse so i would like to disable the trackpad to while i have the mouse plugged in

145327
udp	tcp
the ports that i keep seeing connection attempts at are tcp 44444 tcp 44446 udp 55555 and every now and then some slight variation

145400
mouse	keyboard
the closest thing i have found is placing it in standby but seems to work differently than the sleep button on my keyboard longer bootup doesn t wake on mouse click

145407
direct3d	directdraw
trying and trying think i reinstall it but in a very bad way dxdiag now dont know what version is and directdraw direct3d and aceleration agp dont work any more

145433
folder	directory
you have write permissions on directory within you can create files and folder but if you don t have write permissions on directory you want to delete it won t allow you

145438
vpn	lan
neorouter is a cross-platform zero-configuration vpn solution that securely connects windows mac and linux computers at any locations into a virtual lan and provides a networking platform for various applications like remote desktop shared folders and printers offsite backup voice video chat etc

145454
mouse	keyboard
the rest of the screen looks normal but i can t move the mouse and none of the keyboard shortcuts work to do anything

145475
stdout	stderr
i see this must be something like screen but without vt100 terminal emulation something which will just apply whatever application does with terminal proxy s terminal like outputting something to stdout stderr or using stty to set terminal options to the terminal this proxy runs in

145477
cpu	processors
it depends on cpu and memory mhz however if you are running a single processors 3x4gb will be better than 6x2gb

145482
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
saved to disk as png gif jpeg bmp

145487
kde	gnome
for instance on either windows or linux if you re using gnome or a recent version of kde you d press alt+prtscr to copy the active window s image to the clipboard or just prtscr to capture the entire desktop but you said you just wanted the web page

145499
windows	winpe
another install of windows or winpe would work fine

145533
mouse	keyboard
no reboots or changing configs or swapping batteries on mouse keyboard

145556
sudo	passwd
i am prompted for my system passwd so i assume it is running a sudo command of some sort but do you know what

145569
sudo	passwd
vim would ask for your sudo or su passwd naturally

145586
tunnel	vpn
i guess that your vpn client is set to only route the traffic to the company network through the vpn tunnel

145586
vpn	lan
cisco vpn client s allow local lan access could also cause this behaviour

145633
sudo	passwd
i did this by clicking on it in places i had to enter my sudo passwd

145633
folder	directory
in that directory you ll have a folder called originals and folder called modified

145641
hash	md5
i was thinking of calculating md5 or some other hash of the strings to get rid of the apostrophes and dashes but leave the numbers intact at the end of the lines

145645
debian	linux
what is the best way to install a plugin capable of playing real videos for debian linux

145648
ubuntu	debian
you can even mount the filesystem on the server into your own using sshfs there is a package on debian ubuntu for it named so

145662
stdout	stderr
to me â œredirect the io of a process running in gdbâ seems more like re-opening stdin stdout stderr inside a process that is already running

145662
stdout	stderr
you can change stdin stdout stderr of a running process with among other things gdb

145662
stdout	stderr
an answer to â œredirect stderr stdout of a process after itâ s been started using command line

145666
mouse	keyboard
if necessary you can find out your ipad s ip address under wifi in the settings app. depending on your used vnc client you should also be able to use mouse and keyboard input from your computer on your ipad

145679
postgresql	mysql
instead of mysql you might try postgresql which likely can handle this task more gracefully

145753
mouse	keyboard
you may have also had a problem with the mouse and keyboard thinking it was already paired

145781
cpu	processors
also if you run in 64 bit mode then programs can automatically take advantage of the base line of 64 bit processors which includes sse recent cpu opcode additions etc

145802
folder	directory
example if you want to mount the directory music of a user called pippo at host pluto in a folder . pippo_music then execute

145813
mouse	keyboard
no problems with drivers with my logitech wireless mouse and keyboard + external monitor

145832
mouse	keyboard
remote sessions work as expected but when i get to work the next morning the machine appears to have gone into a sleep or hibernate state from which no amount of mouse moving or keyboard pounding will wake it

145832
mouse	keyboard
it seems that physical access from it s own mouse and keyboard are lost

145833
filesystems	fat
these files are also used to store extended attributes on filesystems that do not support themâ most commonly the fat variants

145833
filesystems	hfs+
the hfs+ filesystems used in mac os x is perfectly capable of storing actual files so once you use the variables to extract the files to the filesystems the files can be accessed properly in all the normal ways

145834
ubuntu	linux
this is in turn maybe an artifact of the fact that this particular session is a remote-desktop session originating from linux ubuntu

145854
mouse	keyboard
the secondary screen is on though and some input being taken as evidenced by the mouse cursor being present and movable but no keyboard input seems to be taken i ve tried logging in blind to no effect and using the keyboard s sleep key

145863
versioning	upgrade
i don t know if the 9.00 alpha versioning can be compared to your 4.57 versioning but if it can then maybe you simply just need to upgrade 7-zip

145868
pop-up	dialog
a user-friendly dialog will pop-up enabling you to specify a range of pages to move and a target destination

145882
mouse	keyboard
it may be built into skype this way because on a video call the participants are likely to be both voice chatting and watching each other thus not doing any keyboard mouse movement

145886
hide	show
it s most likely automatically hide and show the dock checkbox

145923
mouse	keyboard
this searched string is an anchor that i have to take my hands off the keyboard and use the mouse to select this anchor

145930
debian	linux
when i signed up for my debian linux vps hosting and first logged on and invoked ps there was the only user process running sshd

145930
debian	linux
googling minimum linux or linux with sshd only usually brings up debian s netinstall which is not what i want

145966
mouse	keyboard
this might disable mouse and keyboard input

145971
antivirus	norton
i installed norton antivirus firefox putty and cygwin

145980
opensolaris	aix
the november 2009 figures show linux in the lead at 89.2 followed by ibm aix at 4.4 microsoft windows hpc server 2008 at 1.0 and opensolaris at 0.4

ubuntu	linux
it s working fine on linux specifically ubuntu 9.10 on ec2

146001
kde	gnome
i ve been wondering if there s an svn client for ubuntu 10.04 lucid lynx in gnome not kdesvn since it s for kde with context menu so if you right-click on an svn repository you have the options to branch and what-not just like tortoise svn on windows

146017
kde	gnome
and then we need to look at the desktop environments available such as gnome kde x11 cde etc

146022
folder	directory
but it also states that apache has rw right in the temp file folder default temp and the entire config directory config -- that is the part i am unsure of

i had just finished loading up my gmail account in google-chrome firefox to show the speed difference and we d thought it would be hilarious to see how slow ie8 was

146066
ubuntu	linux
i have tried windows and linux ubuntu both have the problem

146069
put	get
too many old programs break the rules and try to put things directly on the c drive and the windows 7 update history can get large over time

if you want to make an actual copy this involves just copying the main files for the vm which generally for vmware would be the vmdk files for virtualbox the vdi s etc

146102
vmware	virtualbox
i would suggest reading the appropriate documentation for your virtualizing software vmware virtualbox and or viewing tutorials or other info on the web like this one

146169
hfs+	ntfs
use a partition editor to make an hfs+ and ntfs partition on the drive- the hfs+ will only be visible on the mac and the ntfs will only be visible on windows unless you install ntfs-3g on the mac

146180
udp	tcp	debian	linux
i downloaded azureus a bittorrent client for debian linux and i notice that azureus got my firewall a verizon wireless base station to open a tcp and udp port forwarding for it without my having to do anything

146188
switching	screens
there is either a mechanical or magnetic switching that is activated when you close the screens

146193
disk	ram
since usb is so slow compared to ram it would use the usb stick as a faster alternative to the hard disk s pagefile

146221
google-chrome	firefox
i don t get that as soon as i open a webpage whether it s with firefox or google-chrome i didn t test ie there are tons of tcp connections between localajaxchat and a supposed google 1e100 domain

146223
move	drag
if you cut or drag drop on the same volume it move them and keeps the original permissions

146225
folder	directory
we have a windows 2003 server with a shared directory folder

146317
versioning	upgrade
macports will also update its python to the latest minor versioning - thus in your case the upgrade from 2.5.4 to 2.5.5

146368
cpu	processors
i m sure that with a modern processors and only 50mb s and no encoding you re unlikely to face any cpu problems

146386
vmware	virtualbox
can i in principle use vmware or virtualbox to install and run a windows machine from linux and connect to the internet using the usb from windows and share it with the host os linux

146400
google-chrome	firefox
does anyone know of a google-chrome or firefox extension that will allow me to do this

146403
vmware	virtualbox	ftp	telnet
it keeps a hierarchical list of all connections and can keep track of a huge number of types of connections rdp vnc pcanywhere teamviewer logmein dameware ftp ssh telnet vmware hyper-v x11 citrix virtualbox etc

146504
macbook	bootcamp
windows 7 under bootcamp is not supported on certain models of macbook pro

146504
macbook	bootcamp
what version of bootcamp did you use to get windows 7 installed onto your macbook pro

146504
macbook	bootcamp
if you managed to get windows 7 installed under a previous version of bootcamp you might not have the latest apple-qualified windows 7 drivers for your macbook pro s chips

146564
filesystems	hfs+
this is an hfs+ mac filesystems driver for windows

146576
rar	zip
compression of the destination into a well-known format rar zip that can be directly read without the use of the application

146578
wan	lan
but when i need to browse in wan for that i have to disable my lan and vice versa

146585
debian	linux
in linux version of firefox specifically in my case debian s rebranded iceweasel folders of bookmarks in the personal toolbar show a little down arrow on the right of the name

146653
ubuntu	debian
whilst you are correct that when you normally download a jdk from sun if you were to download the windows installer it would include a jre it is common for things on debian and ubuntu to be packaged in a more modular way

146701
afp	smb
the airport extreme serves your files via afp and smb mac and windows file sharing respectively

146711
ethernet	wireless
you can use ics to connect them via ethernet you would need a 2nd nic in the desktop or you could use ics if you had a wireless card in your desktop and set up an ad-hoc wifi network to your laptop

146729
mouse	keyboard
i set the sleep time down to 1 minute and wandered fully away from the pc ensuring that no errant mouse or keyboard movements would occur and the pc never went to sleep

146729
mouse	keyboard
i assume that 2 of these are my mouse and keyboard - as i ve recently used them to run the powercfg command

146729
mouse	keyboard
i ve unhooked all usb peripherals save for my keyboard and mouse

146732
ethernet	wireless
you could possibly get another router with both wireless and ethernet ports install dd-wrt on it and setup wireless bridging

146754
ubuntu	linux
that is i tried today unzipping a file on ubuntu linux and it worked fine

146766
ubuntu	linux
i m beginning to think that maybe the answer is to boot linux probably ubuntu and then use some ancient bsd command

146798
ubuntu	opensuse
i had ubuntu fedora opensuse arch

146809
mouse	keyboard
since the computer didn t react on any input from the mouse or keyboard i shut it down by pressing the power button

146830
folder	directory
i didn t compare the root directory because there are some folder such as volumes which will spew out all kinds of errors you re not interested in for example volumes bootvolume is the same as leading to an infinite recursion if you try to compare volumes to anything

146845
post	get
i would try a different power supply or at least unplug everything but the motherboard from the power supply to see if you can get it to post

146861
ubuntu	centos
installed ubuntu 10.04 in place of centos and adjusted the partitions

146882
opera	google-chrome
the fastest rendering and javascript engines lie in either google-chrome or opera at this point but all browsers perform about the same in real life usage except for ie which is horribly slow and not very accurate with standards

146890
subnet	packets
note that this will give you one virtual interface and all network devices will be on the same subnet although they are already on the same subnet dhcp requests aren t relayed from eth0 to wlan0 so you will either get dhcp from the netgear or from your dnsmasq server depending on which packets gets there first

146899
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
on my mac google-chrome 6 gets 3500 opera 10.53 gets 1760 and firefox 3.6.4 gets 170

146945
rar	zip
two examples ate zip and rar witch have an outer container that will allow you to detect what application was used to create them

146972
installation	upgrade
when upgrading from 32-bit windows to windows 7 64-bit the windows installer requires you to use the custom installation option-- upgrade will not be available

147013
gnome-terminal	stty
i tried setting stty -echoctl which solved the problem for rxvt and xterm outside ssh but it created a single-character ht when sshing from an ubuntu hardy system and it created a box with unicode 0003 in it instead of the c in gnome-terminal

147017
ethernet	wireless
since it s a notebook you most likely have both an ethernet and wireless adapter and the ipconfig command filtering for phys doesn t indicate which is which

147033
hide	show
i ve used tweakui to toggle hide show g with no difference

147086
ethernet	wireless
i disable my wireless adapter and use an ethernet cable and it all works fine

147092
mouse	keyboard
when both are connected the keyboard seems to work just fine but the mouse s tracking is jerky and mouse clicks are occasionally missed

147123
mouse	keyboard
if the mouse movement improves with a wired keyboard try that also another argument for not enough bandwidth

147136
kde	gnome
to my knowledge both gnome and kde as well as most other gui interfaces will let you set both speed and acceleration at which point it s just trial and error to find something similar to what you re used to in windows

147136
titlebar	window	kde	gnome
if you re talking about features such as window dragging double-clicking the titlebar to maximize that s dependent on the window manager gnome s metacity kde s kwin compiz etc. and would probably appear under window behavior

147148
versioning	upgrade
upgrade license for owners of a previous versioning s full license

147148
versioning	upgrade
the idea is that you purchase one full license of the software and from then on you can upgrade to newer versioning at a reduced cost

147148
installation	upgrade
upgrade from existing installation

147166
ubuntu	linux
i use ffmpeg on ubuntu linux to convert avis to mp4s

147167
ubuntu	linux
i use ffmpeg on ubuntu linux to convert avis to mp4s

147219
google-chrome	firefox
how can i find out which web frameworks java-script libraries a site uses specially their versions from a web-browser like firefox or google-chrome

147268
pop-up	dialog
in case of internet explorer the pop-up dialog to enter the username password appears only once and the entered login credentials are reused for subsequent http requests to the web server

147359
wan	subnet
if that doesn t work or you need more wireless connections than that provides you should be able to configure the linksys so that its wan connection is .1.3 for example but its ip is .2.1 and it serves dhcp for the whole .2.x subnet

147364
subnet	packets
fwiw the idea behind subnet is to provide a simple way to route packets

147364
subnet	packets
if the destination ip is on the same subnet as the sending device then the sender looks up the ethernet mac address of the destination and then sends the ip packets directly on the local ethernet

147364
subnet	packets
if the destination ip is not in the same subnet as the sender then the packets is sent to the router which tries to forward it to the destination network

147374
udp	tcp
they both implement full tcp ip stacks handle multicast unicast and straight udp fine

147407
folder	directory
usually to the directory of the rar file folder name should be the same as the rar

147419
versioning	upgrade
i would like to create a windows xp guest from the windows xp upgrade cd i have along with one of a few full versioning i have around

147446
firefox	safari
you could use xmarks to automatically keep firefox and safari bookmarks in sync and then sync safari bookmarks with iphone bookmarks whenever you do a normal iphone sync

147446
firefox	safari
this will allow you to keep bookmarks on the iphone and in firefox and safari too

147473
x86	64bit
minimal impact of upgrading 32 to 64 can think of will be mess with the programs 64bit windows 7 uses program files for 64bit applications and program files x86 for 32-bit

147485
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
as a new user of linux i would say that either fedora or ubuntu would fill the role well with centos as another available option

147494
switching	screens
put simply after one user logs in when that user either switching users or logs out windows goes to a black blank screens

147494
switching	screens
the tv screens that is used with this computer previously functioned fine with fast user switching on an xp machine

147588
installation	upgrade
windows upgrade licenses are just that upgrade to existing windows installation

147641
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade it to the versioning that kdelibs needs

147680
disk	ram
given just 2gb of ram and the tasks you re doing it sounds much more likely that you re ram-constrained rather than disk i o performance-constrained

147701
multiplying	subtract
6 hours would be 0.25 you should be able to subtract two times as others have suggested and then multiplying by 24 to get hours

147735
tunnel	vpn
i actually have the reverse problem whereby i need to run my secure vpn software in xp mode and can t access that tunnel from win7

147735
tunnel	vpn
it may be as easy as telling your vpn software to extend the tunnel to xp

147737
temp	tmp
applications usually access them via the environment variables temp and tmp

147806
udp	tcp
i have made sure udp tcp ports 135-139 are unblocked on the windows 7 machine

147807
put	get
i put everything in order today and i can hear people talk when i m logged in through ventrilo however i get no game sounds or music playing from anything else

147845
ubuntu	centos
this behavior seems to be true with my environment on ubuntu centos and macosx

147845
freebsd	linux
if i ssh to a remote linux or freebsd box then c is printed

147868
wan	lan
i d enable this on the lan side but not the wan

147868
wan	lan
eg if the ssh interface is enabled on the lan but not the wan you d ssh into your ubuntu machine and ssh again from there into the router. once there you get a minimal shell often provided by busybox and have access to configuration files daemon scripts firmware settings and whatever commands are installed

147870
rsa	dsa
i don t understand the concept of encryption keys public key private key rsa key dsa key pgp key ssh key what not

147870
rsa	dsa
a public rsa or dsa key will be needed

147870
rsa	dsa
i really don t know what are rsa dsa or how to get their keys

147874
rsa	dsa
rsa and dsa are two encryption forms

147889
google-chrome	firefox
some firefox add-ons smart bookmarks bar are not available as extensions for google-chrome

147889
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way to install firefox add-ons in google-chrome or to install them in one of the firefox-tab extensions

147889
google-chrome	firefox
is there a google-chrome addon to open a new tab as firefox tab similar to ie tab addon but for firefox

147889
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking for an addon for google-chrome which functions similar to ie tab but it opens firefox in a new tab inside google-chrome

147889
google-chrome	firefox
there s lots of addon in firefox that are still not available in google-chrome - the typical one is the smart bookmark toolbar and download helper

147899
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way to export import copy sync my speed dial settings i have in firefox to the speed dial extension in google-chrome

147899
google-chrome	firefox
i know i can export from speed dial in firefox but can t see any easy way to import from speed dial in google-chrome

147921
folder	directory
after running disk utility from the snow leopard disc the applications folder inside my home directory became empty or is not linked to the main applications folder outside my home directory

147928
google-chrome	firefox
looks like speed dial for firefox and speed dial for google-chrome are made by two different developers

147928
google-chrome	firefox
the firefox version allows you to import export data but the google-chrome version has no such options

147937
filesystems	ntfs
depending on the destination filesystems you may be able to reattach them in some way but you d most likely lose their usefulness and you d have the same sort of headaches if you moved them back to ntfs later

147968
folder	directory
the applications folder inside your home directory is not a critical folder

147971
folder	directory
when i open files vim seems to flash up a cmd window for a few second before closing it too quickly to make out the contents and i end up with a c program folder and a files vim vimfiles doc in the directory of the file i just opened

148021
spaces	delimiter
-print0 that s hyphen-print-zero tells find to use a null as the delimiter between paths instead of spaces and -0 that s hyphen zero tells xargs to expect the same

148063
lan	intranet
i m in a company lan with some intranet servers and a proxy for connecting with the outside world

148069
mouse	keyboard
i moved it from one site to another and now when i plug in the usb mouse or keyboard the same ones that were working previously xp brings up the new hardware wizard

148069
mouse	keyboard
going through it the correct keyboard and mouse are identified but xp can t find the drivers

148069
mouse	keyboard
the system was sp2 i have installed sp3 in hopes that would help and i ve also downloaded and installed the mouse drivers from dell s site there are no specific drivers for the keyboard with no change

148072
rss	feed
there s an rss feed i want to subscribe

148072
rss	feed
do i need a fancy program that checks this rss feed for updates frequently

148072
rss	feed
how could i use mail that it tells me when there are new posts in an rss feed

148087
rss	feed
firefox also does rss feed in bookmarks and with a plugin

148094
rss	feed
it syncs directly with google reader which makes it handy if you want to view rss feed on any computer

148123
folder	directory
i need to ftp a directory over to another system and i don t want to have to recreate all the folder on the other system by hand

148136
folder	directory
one note is the folder is inside my user name directory

148165
photoshop	paint.net
so apparantly 6gb isn t enough ram to open a 29k image that loads perfectly fine in mspaint paint.net photoshop

148207
bash	zsh
i find this behavior to be much more intuitive but prefer the other features of zsh to bash

148217
ati	nvidia
nvidia and ati brand cards come with software suites that allow you to specify resolutions if they are not available via windows

148221
gif	png
when you save make sure you use the save for web or other devices and select either a gif or png file and preserve transparency

148225
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
the three main guis for ubuntu are gnome kde xfce

148225
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
the following instructions should work in gnome kde and xfce

148225
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
the format of these gnome kde xfce .desktop files is further described at the freedesktop.org desktop entry specification

148230
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard shortcuts mouse right-click context window won t do it

148236
ati	nvidia
generally speaking any recent video card from nvidia ati intel or another major manufacturer will support any resolution the monitor marks as displayable

148236
ati	nvidia
supported resolutions aren t put in ads for graphics cards because only the maximum resolution is dependent on the graphics card and it should be good to display any resolution less than that most consumer cards from ati nvidia will support up to wqxga per display given a dual-link dvi cable or similar

148239
disk	ram
quite often the speed of virtual machines is heavily constrained by disk speed as well as by available ram

148289
temp	tmp
in my experience most programs will expect files in tmp or temp to be removed unless they re locked so i would say 99.9 no unless you have an extremely badly designed program that writes permanent files to the temporary folder

148299
mouse	keyboard
windows 7 has the snap feature which can be done with keyboard or mouse

148312
temp	tmp
you can move temp and tmp by editing the user system variables

148335
temp	tmp
first thing would be to write the crontab to a tmp file and then manipulate that temp file

148410
ethernet	wireless
i ve checked the windows 7 compatibility site and it lists a fair few usb ethernet wired not wireless adapters that should work with windows 7 64-bit

148416
iscsi	smb
what are the advantages of using iscsi versus smb

148434
iscsi	smb
i think smb is your typical network share whereas iscsi is presented as a exclusive direct-attached block-based storage like a locally installed hdd and therefore allows your choice of file system with its own associated pros and cons

148463
cifs	smb	iscsi	smb	iscsi	cifs
mike is correct iscsi and smb cifs operate at two different layers of abstraction

148463
cifs	smb
you can think of smb cifs as exporting a file system that other machines can access

148463
cifs	smb	iscsi	smb	iscsi	cifs
software such as openfiler and freenas allow you to aggregate a pool of storage and allow both iscsi and smb cifs access

148463
iscsi	cifs
the iscsi space must be pre-allocated much a like a virtual machine hard disk and is not visible to the cifs clients

148463
iscsi	smb
iscsi in general will perform better because there will not be as many layers of abstraction in the way - the smb protocol in this case

148497
switching	screens
because of the different resolutions when i switching computers i use screens -rd to attach to my screens session

148497
switching	screens
switching back and forth between screens windows does not help

148515
ubuntu	linux
i tried searching the internet but could not find a decent tutorial explaining how to create a bootable ubuntu linux 10.04 usb installation that could be run not only on a pc but also on macs and macbook pros

148515
ubuntu	linux
partition 1 ext3 bootable - ubuntu linux 32 bit contains also grub2 bootloader

148515
ubuntu	linux
partition 2 ext3 - ubuntu linux 64 bit

148516
ssl	https
https is ssl

148516
udp	tcp
it may open a udp connection or an unsecured tcp connection when sending raw data to the repository

148542
bmp	png
it also seems that it happens with png files but not bmp files

148543
mouse	keyboard
wish that wasn t the case as the keyboard mouse situation is a bit ugly but better than the click wait switch times on dvi usb kvms

148575
vmware	bootcamp
what is the best way for me to migrate my vmware fusion bootcamp partition to a new mac

148624
ethernet	wireless
both pcs are usually connected wireless however ethernet cable can be used during backup to speed up the process

148641
folder	directory
check the folder .gconf system networking in your old home directory

148644
mp3	flac
including aac ape flac m4a mp3

148644
wav	ogg
mp4 mpc ogg pcm wav wma and wv

148650
ssl	https
if your svn repository has a https url then all svn traffic including your username and password will flow over that https http over ssl tls connection

148665
sudo	passwd
how can a user be setup to sudo or su - without entering a passwd

148666
mouse	keyboard
how about the world s cheapest netbook 99 and that includes the screen cpu battery keyboard mouse

148669
sudo	passwd
i haven t tested this but i think the following would allow all users in the cdrom group to run sudo k3b without needing a passwd

148678
filesystems	btrfs
as far as i know the only way to avoid such corruption is to use end-to-end checksums in addition to file mirroring either automatically as part of the filesystems zfs or btrfs or periodically or manually recalculating rsync checksums simple file verification parchive file sets etc.

148710
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
i tried google-chrome opera and mozilla firefox

148789
disk	ram
i have also looked at ram disk but i believe i would be required to re-install and update the game into ram when i really just want the c x y z texture1.dds file to be mapped into memory

148790
cpu	processors
from what i understand one or more core are part of a processors cpu

148795
disk	ram
get that ram disk going and copy the texture1.dss file to it

148795
disk	ram
now rename your original file to something else for safe keeping ram disk are not that reliable you know and remap that file to the ram disk on the filesystem level

148795
disk	ram
you should probably shut those virtual machines down though you need to make sure that you still got plenty free ram when the game is running and you got the ram disk loaded

148807
disk	ram
short-term ssd new cpu more ram for the ram disk solution

148807
disk	ram
i would not create a ram disk and copy the files

148807
disk	ram
the game engine will still read files from the ram disk into ram

148807
disk	ram
after all the point of the ram disk is to be transparent to the end user

148807
disk	ram
the disk will appear as a hard disk and the game will treat the ram disk as a hard disk

148818
putty	winscp
please no use filezilla winscp putty answers

148840
ethernet	wireless
connects to the internet via ethernet or wireless and

148842
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
does linux ubuntu 10.04 lucid lynx or debian 5.0.5 lenny support this envisioned setup different workspaces in a way that keyboard workspace switching only works in the current monitor

148846
ati	nvidia
if it s any consolation i had better success with nvidia cards rather than ati

148850
trojan	virus
if any of those are high - that might indicate a trojan horse virus which you may then identify by the process name then look it up in the online virus databases and find a proper cure

148851
stdout	stderr
cmd_grep subprocess.popen ack-grep --no-color --max-count 1 --no-group def run_main .. cgedit stdout pipe stderr pipe

148886
min	max
those of you familiar with this technique of converting time to a decimal may recall that excel 2003 allowed you to enter a date and time like â œ1 1 07 11 00 amâ directly in the axis option min max fields and excel would calculate the appropriate decimal representation

148934
ubuntu	linux
i am attempting to transfer a 6.1 gb file between a ubuntu linux 9.10 and a mac osx 10.6

148983
post	get
when i switch my newly built pc on the fans start up but i get nothing on the monitor and the post display on the motherboard runs quickly through various codes and then stops at code 18 which does not appear in the manual the list there seems identical to this one

149013
put	get
if it works you ve got broken avis or possibly an ffmpeg bug -- either way you can put all your videos into new avi containers and get it done that way

149054
filesystems	ntfs
assuming that i am not going to add ntfs drivers that allow read+write of ntfs partitions i was wondering if the choice of filesystems when i partition an external usb drive matters

149062
ubuntu	linux
you can use dd though if you re going the linux livecd route i believe the ubuntu disk comes with a utility called partimage which will allow you to create compressed image and store them on an external drive remote network server as it creates it and let you later restore said image to disk

149073
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox supports vmware s vmdk format

149094
google-chrome	firefox
i had the same problem wanted to open google-chrome instead firefox

149116
disk	ram
there are traditionally northbridge chipsets which handle high-speed connections like ram cpu and video and a southbridge chipset which handles slower operations like disk i o usb pci etc

149154
disk	ram
the question is about if it s a good idea to put the swap file in a ram disk

149154
disk	ram
would a ram disk help in any way or will windows intelligently use all the available memory for all its work

149154
disk	ram
i am also thinking of putting the temp folder on aâ ram disk

149154
disk	ram
i knowâ the ram disk is volatile memory and i don t care about its content if it gets lost

149160
ubuntu	linux
how do you track which packages were installed on ubuntu linux

149164
move	drag
i have 3 monitors running on 2 cards they are all working as 3 seperate displays however if i move the main display from the left 0 0 i cannot drag to the left window as the mouse goes crazy and crashes my system i have to restart x

149184
disk	ram
as for temp files moving those to a ram disk should increase their access speeds though make sure that you won t need anything in there to persist through a reboot crash and that the ramdisk driver loads and creates the ramdisk before any applications or the system needs to use the temp folder

149190
opera	firefox
i usually use screengrab to do this with firefox but in this situation i want a screenshot of the page as opera renders it because i want to show the page as rendered with html5 form controls like date and time

149195
photoshop	fireworks	mouse	keyboard
or you could always take a screen shot by hitting the print screen button on your keyboard and croup out everything other than the browser window in a graphics editing program like photoshop fireworks or even the primitive ms paint such a crop job takes no graphics editing experience as it s just a matter of selecting the crop tool dragging it over the area in the image that you want to keep and double clicking the mouse and saving the result

149196
x86	64bit
however in all honesty there are not many improvements in x64 windows over x86 unless you actually make use of applications that are only available in 64bit editions or are always at around 90 memory utilisation

149220
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to use clear motorola wimax usb in ubuntu as there is no support for linux as yet

152157
google-chrome	safari
the start up speed of the new safari 5 has convinced me to switch to it from google-chrome

152158
mouse	trackpad
i missed this feature too but if you have a trackpad or magic mouse i found that an even better solution is jitouch

152176

it also supports things like tinting the background color replacing it with an image changing the cursor etc. but by default it just locks the keyboard mouse and leaves x the way it is

152184

whenever i start up outlook it pop-up a dialog asking if i want to connect to the exchange server or work offline or just quit the program

the usb extenders my search brought up all only state usb1.1 support - this would be too slow for attaching external drives aside from small flash drives perhaps but fine for your keyboard mouse and other similar controllers

152824
mouse	keyboard
assuming your keyboard and mouse and other controllers if you have them are usb based then there is a limit of 5 meters between each device so you would need a hub at least every 5 meters

153327
google-chrome	firefox	ubuntu	linux

154333
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
from what i heard ubuntu is a basically a debian linux with some extra applications and drivers pre-installed in order to make it more user friendly

154334
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian it uses the same package structure but includes some more upto date versions debian is very conservative

154346
vpn	lan
if i setup a xp-pro vpn server and a user logs into it from outside the lan can they remote desktop to any of the machines on the network

154347

git or mercurial or bazaar sounds more appropriate for your needs as they re distributed scms in that you operate on a local repo all the time and then push changes to a remote repo

154568
bazaar	git
bazaar is one developed by canonical and git by linus

154568
restrict	shared
that s about all the differences between them anyone cares about there are comparisons on the web - apart from git not being native windows mercurial is probably better as it supports more of a what you have is what the remote users have whereas git is more a what remote users have is what you let them have which will require more effort from you given your requirements both of course can shared all or subsets but its easier for mercurial to have a subset restrict than it is for git to shared all

155651
disk	ram
would a ram disk help

155652
disk	ram
it sounds like you need to first create a ram disk

155652
disk	ram
the only thing i would add is setting your temporary directory onto the ram disk

155652
temp	tmp
this is stored in environment variables as tmp and temp

155652
disk	ram
within visual studio you then need to make sure that everything you can set as path options in visual studio points to the ram disk

155652
temp	tmp
this includes the project input and output directories and any temporary directories it might need though theoretically these should all be keyed off of the tmp temp environment variables

155653
disk	ram
any disk writes that visual studio performs will completely instantaneously as data gets written to ram

155653
disk	ram
making it very likely that the next read will come out of ram instead of having to be retrieved from the disk

155653
disk	ram
this works so well and is secure that ram disk are no longer used

155720
mouse	keyboard
note also that when i connect directly the monitor to the video card removing the kvm from the loop windows automatically recognize the monitor and display 1920x1080 60 without problem but i need to use this kvm as i don t have enough place to have an other monitor keyboard mouse

hash	md5
while there have been some reported weaknesses to md5 that suggest it is possible to have the same hash for two different inputs generally speaking the whole point of md5 is to prevent what you are asking for

156150
hash	md5
there certainly are tools that will brute-force md5 and other hashing algorithms for the purpose of finding out the original value but i stand by my statement that there are no such tools that are designed for the purpose of locating hash collisions two different strings that will result in the same hash

156163
vmware	virtualbox
i have never tried vmware myself only virtualbox and there it works withouth any problems

156164
hash	md5
it s in fact just a big database that has been generated using dictionary of user input to generate the corresponding md5 hash

156164
hash	md5
so if your md5 hash is generated from a common or dictionary phrase good chance you ll find it

for the ram disk i got

156531

but copying to a ram disk you actually wait until the data is physically copied and since you re basically doing a ram-to-ram copy you ve got contention

156545

when you put multiple qubits electrons together you can get more complicated superpositions like 11 10 00 or 110 101 011 001 000 or whatever and if you use those in the right kind of computer it s like running an algorithm with 3 or 5 or however many inputs simultaneously

tunnel	vpn
and traffic that doesn t use the vpn isn t encrypted by the vpn so if you use split tunnel traffic not addressed to the other end of the vpn is not protected by the vpn

156907
antivirus	mcafee
this should bypass explorer triggering the antivirus scan with mcafee which is effectively locking the file and preventing you from deleting it

however when you did the two-finger click on the new trackpad it fires a right mouse click event as i press down and then a left mouse click event when i release

spoofing	traffic
if you didn t happen to capture that client s 4-way handshake you can send a spoofed de-authenticate packet to the target client spoofing it to make it look like it came from the ap s mac address forcing the client to fall off the network and get back on so you can capture its 4-way handshake this time and decrypt all further traffic to from that client

this fifo queue becomes a problem when you start uploading

when you connect your netgear dg834g v3 as shown in the diagram above then you have wired lan wan connectivity to the dg834g

157136

when you substitute a netgear wpn802 v1 for the dg834g and use the same configuration as above then you are able to connect to both lan wan using both wired wireless connections to the wpn802

157161
disk	ram
note this software is not ram disk where you define a logical drive and you put stuff in there

157172
cpu	processors
it can t be stressed enough that there needs to be good thermal conductivity between the cpu and the heatsink as processors generate a lot of heat

157179
put	get
if you get the cherry it s based off of you may be able to take the pcb from that one and put it into your broken keyboard

157181

you would then enter the one static ip you were given as the wan information for the router connect the router via its wan port to the ethernet port from your isp and then connect your systems to the router lan ports

157186
ubuntu	linux
my os is ubuntu 10 and would be happy if some linux geek could suggest me solution of my problem

157200
folder	directory
i wonder if there is a tool that will list file directory take a snapshot of the folder and file structure like the following

157258
put	get
change it to ppoe and you will get a place to put your login id and password and have the router auto connect

157291
filesystems	ntfs
ms does not read nix filesystems for one thing there are utils that do do this but not one that i ve trusted yet and although on the nix side ntfs support has come a long ways it s still not perfect

edit both the temp and tmp variables to your desired directory

157429
debian	linux
i m running grml a debian squeeze based linux distro and occasionally certain processes will runaway and cause 100 cpu usage

157438
cpu	processors
i donâ t think you will find a core i5 or an i7 without a dedicated on processors power microprocessor which has ultimate control of the behavior of the cpu depending upon its intended deployment environment desktop mobile etcâ unless itâ s an e or engineering sample in which case i donâ t think i would want it in my machine iâ ve had them and well theyâ re dodgy at best

157443
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs filesystems does not support posix-style file ownership or permissions

157443

157546
ethernet	wireless
all you need to do is connect to the wireless network then set a route for the lab lan out the ethernet device

157546
ethernet	wireless
the default route will point to the wireless device giving you access to the internet and packets to addresses on the lab lan will go out the ethernet device

157550

versioning	upgrade
but it upgrade to 3.5.10 and then it has a link to see the latest versioning which is 3.6.6

157569

maybe the upgrade can only go from your specific versioning to that specific versioning

157590
put	get
put it in a perfect place where it can t get a damage and so on

157650

however this second behavior has been removed in the new beta versioning of live so your easiest solution is to upgrade to that

157852
installation	upgrade
without being able to load the original vista installation how can i perform an upgrade to windows 7 without losing my user accounts and installed programs

157853
folder	directory
so if you want to install it for one user only put it in that user s applications folder in his home directory

157858
installation	upgrade
you will have to repair the vista installation to do an upgrade to preserve your accounts and settings

157883
rar	zip
i have tried all of the following applications download.cnet.com - the free ones and none of them will convert an rar archive to a zip without compressing the files store mode

it will convert an rar to a zip but it compresses the zip

is there any way to force google-chrome to use plain text like firefox and ie

158047
rpm	yum
every time i update certain packages with rpm yum they reset certain permissions on their files directories which i have intentionally changed for various reasons

158064
disk	ram	ubuntu	debian
you do not need to allocate much resource to the vm i m guessing a server install of ubuntu or a base install of debian would happily run such a samba share in 128mb of ram or less and would not need much more than a single gb of disk space in fact it may only take a couple of hundred mb if that on the host machine

you can use a netinstall image here are debian s and here is ubuntu s mini.iso

158619
ubuntu	centos
i have used ubuntu as a host os for virtualbox quite a bit - and i have been very happy as the virtualbox package can get updated along with the rest of the operating system when issuing a apt-get update - and i haven t seen conflicts or warnings like those described on the centos page though i suppose they certainly could happen

158619
uninstall	upgrade
i also have used windows as a host quite a bit and it tends to just work there - though i have had upgrade issues with older builds in the 2.x line that would require a complete uninstall and reinstall

158622
folder	directory
i ve got a directory inside my personal folder that has a few hundred items in it

158806
disk	ram
as chris pointed out the problem discussed in the article with reference to linux and plain-text passwords specifically is that a password which is stored in ram as cleartext as it necessarily must be at some point could be part of a page that gets swapped out to the disk and thus it could wind up being readable from the free space on the disk

in apt-based systems like debian or ubuntu i believe it s just sudo apt-get --reinstall install apache2.2-common
