488464
torque	slurm
you could also use something like the torque resource manager or slurm simple linux utility for resource management to do the execution on the laptops but you would still need a script to create the jobs that you would hand off to torque slurm

ssd	sata
other 15 12 sata 3 ssd drives i want to build with aufs xfs and ethernet 4gb sec network

488495
udp	tcp
the protocol name tcp is a mandatory attribute defining which protocol should be used for forwarding udp could also be used

488510
sorting	filtering
however since switching to access 2010 performance tanked when filtering and sorting tables in an adp and watching it via profiler i know why -- access is not only not preparing a where clause for mssql to implement the filtering it is asking for the raw table multiple times regardless which filtering are in place

488510
sorting	filtering
what the heck is access doing here and how can i make it use sql server to perform the filtering and sorting and to not make multiple trips every time the table filtering are changed

488551

i know windows 7 supposedly improved on page file management over xp but it seems excessive for this kind of slowdown disk thrashing and high hard fault count when i have that much free ram

488570
mouse	keyboard
i recently bought a logitech wireless keyboard and mouse with unified receiver logitech wireless combo mk220

488570
mouse	keyboard
i did not like wireless keyboard so i use ps2 keyboard + wireless mouse

488570
mouse	keyboard
now i am in doubt while i am using wireless mouse and not using wireless keyboard is the latter discharging its power count-downing its life-time

488570
mouse	keyboard
is it possible to switch off the keyboard or mouse without removing batteries

488574
rpm	yum
also since node is so heavily developed and releases so often it s possible that rpm packagings of more recent versions may not percolate down into the yum repositories for distribution for some time that s my experience with epel and a lot of rapidly-developed software

488576
mouse	keyboard
while i am using wireless mouse and not using wireless keyboard is the latter discharging its power count-downing its life-time

488576
mouse	keyboard

mouse	keyboard
when the laptop is at home i want both the desktop and the laptop to use the same 2+ monitors the keyboard and the mouse or mice if i add a track pad

488762
mouse	keyboard
i like to use synergy to use both computers with one keyboard and mouse at the same time

488762
mouse	keyboard
synergy requires that the keyboard and mouse be connected to one computer the server which shares them with other computers clients over wifi

488762
mouse	keyboard
sometimes i want my laptop to be the server physically connected to the keyboard and mouse and sometimes i want my desktop to be the server

488762
mouse	keyboard
this means that i need the keyboard mouse other usb devices to be able to switch computers without me playing musical plugs

488762
mouse	keyboard
in any case the keyboard and mouse need to be able to be physically connected to either computer without lots of fussing with plugs

488762

mouse	keyboard
desktop and laptop each control a monitor but the laptop has a physical connection to the keyboard an mouse which it shares with the desktop via wifi

488762

488762
mouse	keyboard
basically i need a kvm switch which allows me to switch individual monitors keyboard mouse usb hub between computers independently of each other or a better solution

488838

due to a lack of ips we put the servers which don t need to be externally accessible on a private subnet and our firewall simply routes between the two subnets and nats if a machine on the private subnet needs to get out to the internet

488838
ubuntu	centos
this happens on the server centos and the test ubuntu vm i also tried it with

488839
sudo	passwd
and you can use sudo john to become user john without knowing his passwd

488841
openvpn	iptables
of course this requires some knowledge of iptables or you could use something like shorewall or packet filter or you could still have an isa box with openvpn and squid setup in a different box but why pay for extra licenses and most important why run a gui server for a firewall vpn or proxy cache

488845
.profile	shebang
alternatively also reliant on .profile add an executable bash script to bin with the correct shebang #

489274
bluetooth	usb
with bluesoleil the default stack that came with the usb bluetooth i could set my device as headset instead of only laptop desktop and this allowed both my phones to detect my laptop as a device they can use as a headset but the problem with this stack was that only the older phone could actually connect to my laptop and that the internal bluetooth could not be used

one way of doing this is 265 5 icon count 53 so we can create a helper layer with the size of 53px in width and 38px in height then we could get each icon in the helper layer center align it and then when finished put them next to each other and remove the helper layers

the user experience the exact steps to take in order to burn the iso will vary but in general you just fire up the file manager application fire up firefox do your thing in firefox in order to download the iso download it then right-click on the downloaded iso in the downloads folder in your home directory and there should be an option to burn it to cd

492307
google-chrome	firefox
see the screen shot as i ve set the google-chrome to default you can do it for firefox

492338
cpu	processors
this is not true however for recent intel gpus integrated into their processors sandy and ivy bridge where the memory architecture is almost entirely coherent graphics memory is system memory and reads from graphics memory are as cheap for the cpu as they are for the gpu

492338
hlsl	glsl
shaders written in high level languages like hlsl glsl or opengl arb shader assembler are eventually translated by the driver into gpu instructions by banging on certain registers and doing the required pcie hoops in order to send over batch buffers of compute and or render commands

492619
versioning	upgrade
is this true or will i need to enter two keys to make the upgrade work one for the previous versioning and then one for windows 8

492623
installation	upgrade
you can use the same installer to upgrade multiple pcs but you do need different keys and the upgrade license permits you to upgrade one installation of windows to windows 8

tunnel	packets
because as far as i know a tunnel wraps the tcp ip packets through ssh but in this scenario the ssh client doesn t have access to the tcp ip packets it only gets the application level information get

492700
tunnel	lan
the wrapping or tunnel indeed happens at tcp level the stream coming over the ssh connection is connected to the socket connection in the lan and everything that goes forth and back over this also goes over that

you might be tempted to brun a dvd from the rtm iso with the view to buying a key later so you can download it however the evaluation versioning of windows 8 will expire source and can t be upgrade to retail

493153

note this versioning will expire and you cannot upgrade

they won t need to reinstall the previous versioning to do the upgrade

493516

the upgrade assistant will let you choose to upgrade directly or build installation media

493516
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i canâ t seem to find the page at the momentâ iâ ll link to it when i find itâ but one of the upgrading to windows 8 pages specifically mentions that the installation process detects the windows versioning from the key so it should acknowledge the attempt to upgrade

493527

can i upgrade windows 8 on a trial versioning of a previous windows release

493529

so if i upgrade my windows 7 to 8 can i in the future buy an ssd drive and copy my installation into it

well you can use mpd for remote playing but it works like this you set up the mpd server on one computer where your mp3 ogg collection sits and then you can use a mpd client such as sonata on another computer where you play the music

493586
installation	upgrade
i m planning to buy a windows 8 upgrade for my computer and need to know if i have to keep my windows 7 disks around and have to install windows 7 first before doing the upgrade or if there is somewhere that i can enter my windows 7 key alongside the windows 8 upgrade key if i want to do a clean installation of windows 8 from bootable media

493588
versioning	upgrade
but you will need the license key and have the previous versioning of windows installed to use the upgrade versioning of windows 8

493923
opera	google-chrome
one of them is to use keyboard modifiers as mtone suggested but if you d like opera to handle background tabs the same way google-chrome does then you re better off doing this

493923
opera	google-chrome
clicking on it will either send the selected text to your default search engine or if it s a url opera will load it in the background page like google-chrome does

493936

disk	ram
but there are more considerations to it than just how much you have - if your system runs out of ram it will page to the hard disk instead which makes it slower because the access time to your hard drive is significantly higher than the access time to the ram

494650
x86	64bit
you can find out quickly if your system is a 64bit operating system by looking at the c drive - 64bit versions of windows come with two program files folders one called program files where the 64bit applications are kept and one called program files x86 where the 32-bit applications are kept

494697
installation	upgrade
you might have to reactivate possibly over the phone but other than that you can just do the hardware upgrade and continue using your windows 8 installation

494697
versioning	upgrade
so if you buy a new motherboard you ll have to get a new licence of a previous versioning of windows in order for your computer to remain eligible to use the windows 8 upgrade licence

494697
versioning	upgrade
or would i have to reformat the drive install my previous versioning of windows then pop in the same upgrade disc after upgrade my motherboard

494697

all you have to do is reinstall the previous versioning of windows that you upgrade from

494698
installation	upgrade
also you are free to perform a fresh installation instead of an upgrade

494718
versioning	upgrade
while browsing the microsoft store to look for a digital delivery windows 8 license i could only find what i assume is the upgrade versioning since it has the following note

494724
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade versioning works for clean installs

494725
versioning	upgrade
retail versioning are versioning you need to obtain through a local computer store and can t be obtained from microsoft under the form of an upgrade

494727
versioning	upgrade
you will require a full license if you re building from scratch and do not have a valid windows license you can use the upgrade versioning on

494727
versioning	upgrade
if you have a valid windows xp through 7 you could install that and then the upgrade versioning over it

494743

it includes screenshots and instructions for all major web browsers internet explorer mozilla firefox and google-chrome

494750

dropbox	skydrive	folder	directory
replacing the two directory paths with the ones for your actual dropbox and skydrive folder

494754
dropbox	skydrive
if the files you have in dropbox are not synced in skydrive too copy them over to skydrive s folder

494754
dropbox	skydrive
delete dropbox folder and create a junction with its name pointing to the skydrive one cmd

494754
dropbox	skydrive
maybe this is what you wanted to know you ll notice is that dropbox would be unable to sync a file called .lock that skydrive uses and in skydrive you ll notice a folder called .dropbox.cache

494757
versioning	upgrade
because you can upgrade to win8 pro for only 40 for the digital download versioning that is likely your best and cheapest option

494774
folder	directory
you could attempt to temporarily mimic a folder where the junction point now is that only contains the microsoft related directory don t forget the hidden folder and system files

494782
versioning	upgrade
ever since the days of windows 95 microsoft has distinguished between an oem license an upgrade and a full versioning

i do not have a windows 7 system to upgrade so my installation is extremely clean and the only bump i ran into was needing to run the guest addition drivers for win8 by hand following the manual installation instructions

495734

the installation process has succeeded 4 times in a row as i experiment with different settings for the vm and display - so i would say you might dive in once you ve made a backup of your existing windows 7 setup and have time to upgrade

if it s either latency ping or packet loss you could configure the vpn network to cope better with this by allowing higher ping before timeouts are returned or making sure if packets are recieved by sending confirmation tcp does this udp not therefore udp is faster but less reliable in this aspect.

the scan dialog allows me to select jpg png bmp and tif file formats

496856

from jpg png bmp and tif only jpg introduces a lossy compression and can achieve the lowest file sizes

496856
tiff	png
taking that into account there s no real difference between those although the tiff format supports layers and png supports transparency â but this won t matter when simply scanning documents

google-chrome	firefox
the simplest way is to download and install a sufficiently large font such as symbola and use firefox or google-chrome

the best combination you can do is the ram disk and an ssd

497701
disk	ram
most programs now have the ability to save on shutdown so it migrates the data from the ram disk to your ssd so none of your data is lost

497701
disk	ram
there are somewhat large differences in speeds depending on what you re using the ram disk for

497701
disk	ram
anything that requires an intensive read and write rate then ram disk outperforms anything

497701
disk	ram
compilations coding data intense games battlefield 3 maps crysis etc. and stuff like that would benefit greatly from ram disk vs

497701

any application like that would benefit dramatically with ram disk so no ram disk isn t obsolete

498012
mouse	trackpad
is there a way that i can set my trackpad to use natural scrolling and set my mouse to use reversed scrolling at the same time

498014
mouse	trackpad
this free app called scroll reverser has a setting that allows the mouse and the trackpad to be independently and simultaneously set to natural or reversed scrolling

498015
post	get
i might get inspired later and write this in a follow up post

498021
mouse	trackpad
boot camp drivers mostly work though trackpad functionality was completely absent in windows 8--you ll have to temporarily plug in an external usb mouse so that you can fix the trackpad drivers

debian-based	linux
this slideshow covers several solutions for a package-caching proxy for debian-based linux distributions

498066
ubuntu	debian
insert a livecd into your cd-drive the livecd should be ubuntu or some ubuntu debian derivative

498067
folder	directory
grub s root directory is boot so you have to tell it where to find that folder

498125
switching	screens
i am guessing that windows 8 has convinced the laptop to switching to uefi boot rather than the bios boot that was there previously as the lenovo splash screens on startup now no longer has the options to interrupt the boot process for example to choose the boot drive

498125
ubuntu	linux
first preference in the bios for booting and ubuntu on the other drive sata hdd listed in linux as dev sda

robocopy	xcopy
i boot to command line using windows install disc. acronis true image file backup restore doesn t copy symbolic links or junctions and seems to skip several files as well and runs incredibly slow from the boot cd. even xcopy and robocopy fail to copy 100 of the files and neither can copy junctions hardlinks or directory symbolic links

498235
folder	directory
and because windows uses a number of directory junctions in these folder you re forced to rebuild them manually one by one

498266
ethernet	wireless
maybe there is a windows program that discovers printers connected to computer through usb or ethernet my printer has both sockets and allows to pre-configure it for wireless usage enter the long wpa key

the only way i have been able to get to any of the main directory is through the go to folder command in finder and try to find the file to no avail

when you download at the full rate it might be blocking your keyboard and mouse from communicating with the computer as well

newer versioning such as java 7 won t install on any system below lion 10.7.0 so you ll have to stick to the older versioning until either oracle releases a working installer or apple releases an upgrade which is unlikely

i have windows 7 oem versioning installed on my pc at the moment and i want to upgrade my motherboard cpu and graphics card but i ve been told that an oem versioning of windows will not boot if i change the hardware

499444
versioning	upgrade
therefore the post-upgrade computer won t be eligible for the windows 8 upgrade since you don t have a valid licence of a previous windows versioning for it

499444
versioning	upgrade
since the windows 8 upgrade requires a valid licence of a previous versioning of windows and your post-upgrade pc no longer has one you ll be breaking the terms of the eula if you continue using windows 8

499444
versioning	upgrade
your options are either to buy a retail versioning of windows 7 for the new motherboard and upgrade from that or just buy a retail or system builder versioning of windows 8

499515
irix	linux
as perceive it there are two good solutions the the problem either windows provide a way for applications to specify which versions of third party libraries they need and they get automatically installed and updated as in for example linux or windows ships with it s own official build of gtk+ which third party applications has to be compatible with as in for example irix

499617
ubuntu	linux
it seems to be quite pretty and consistent with the rest of the new windows 8 design so it would be cool to put linux ubuntu into it instead of using grub or burg

ubuntu	linux
copy all of your boot files from the new install to the broken one using a linux livecd i would recommend ubuntu as it comes with gparted software which will allow you to do the aforementioned partitioning changes

499709
ubuntu	linux
if it doesn t doesn t consider using a linux livecd i prefer ubuntu a very user-friendly distro to copy your data over to a new install of windows either disk-to-external-media-and-back-to-disk or just into a new windows partition

i think a better solution would be to write a sudo rule that always requires a passwd to be entered for the halt command

memdisk is able to emulate a hdd a cd a floppy disk etc sometimes it does a good job analyzing your image and detecting what you want to mount and sometimes you have to say it with a command line

this may be happening in hotmail as well but i use gmail more frequently

if your pc has a 64-bit capable processors cpu but is currently running a 32-bit version of windows you can install a 64-bit version of windows 8 pro but you ll need to buy it as a dvd and perform a custom installation

you can still use such big disks as data disks under windows though and you can boot some non-microsoft oses such as linux and freebsd on big disks using gpt under bios

that is using push and pull directly

501900

502093
ssd	sata
i built a pc but connected the ssd to a sata 2 port the blue ones looked more impressive faster than the grey

502093
ssd	sata
i then noticed the ssd was connected to the sata 2 instead of sata 3 so i reconnected the ssd to the sata 3 port

502093
ssd	sata
if i reconnect the ssd back to the sata 2 port the pc boots without an issue

502112
pull	push
however everything works if i just open a shell in the repo and do a git pull or git push manually

502115
mouse	joystick
i found a solution myself by handling the joystick events and mouse position with python pygame and win32api

502141
switching	screens

the ebuild environment file is located at var tmp portage kde-base kdepimlibs-4.9.3 temp environment

502302
mouse	keyboard
one single keyboard and mouse

502315
folder	directory
moving the folder only works as i suspected if the owner application exposes a setting to control the location of the directory

502315
folder	directory
better still would be to put these folder in the appdata directory itself a hidden folder and left them visible within that directory

502338
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout to stderr

502338
stdout	stderr
or stderr to stdout

i recently tuned debian to look more like ubuntu by switching to ubuntu fonts and installing the dark ambiance theme

502410
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
assuming that you have a non oem versioning of windows 7 then yes you can uninstall windows from the old machine and then install windows 7 on a new machine and then install the windows 8 upgrade

502413
ubuntu	linux
installed a swap partition and a partition for ubuntu linux 12.10 on the first part of the disk

502419
vim	sublimetext
it s strange that there s not solution for vim since its a developer s tool mostly sublimetext and npp already have that solved in a simple manner

502425
filesystems	ntfs
choose filesystems before formated i took the ntfs

502439
installation	upgrade
you still need an existing valid windows operating system of some kind on the target machine to anchor the new windows 8 installation on the pc where you will use the upgrade

502464
ssd	sata
since your new ssd is larger and both are sata i do not expect any problems for making a copy

502470
hex	binary
however if you want to show binary or hex in vim you can by doing something like this

502504
width	height
set the window size values though you may have to experiment to get the width and height you desire

502530
daemon	cron
i don t have the privilege to comment so i can t ask for clarification but i would suggest running the daemon either from an initscript or from rc.local and not from cron

502530
daemons	systemd
the handling of daemons and services is usually a job for your init systemd

502537
gmail	hotmail
the best way to manage contacts in bulk may be to go to the source of them google contacts for your gmail contacts or windows live for your hotmail contacts and deal with them there

the ram doesn t really buffer the data that is to be written to the disk

502559
disk	ram
as time goes on more and more applications are more demanding on ram and disk activity

502588
wan	lan
if you want the linux machine to provide dhcp service to the devices that connect to the wgr614 you ll need to connect the linux machine to a wgr614 lan port not its wan port

502588
ethernet	wireless
in this configuration the wgr614 s routing firewalling nat functionality will be unused and the device will serve only as an ethernet switch and a wireless access point

i have a postfix dovecot mail server setup using tls

502634
put	get
i m trying to set up a batch file i would run via task scheduler to put my computer to sleep at a given time but i can t get exactly what i want .

502705
wan	lan
i m trying to set up a second wlan at home since the nintendo ds firmware won t connect to my wpa-encrypted main wlan but when i connect my second router s wan port to one of my main router s lan ports the routers won t talk and i can t connect wirelessly to the second router

the windows 8 charms bar can be accessed using the keyboard instead of the mouse by using the keyboard combination windows + c

502721

instead of using your wireless router as intended nat routing dhcp client server pppoe client etc. converting it into a wireless access point will save you a lot of headackes and make the configuration much simpler

502752
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu 12.04 and in options menu i see only tango linux xterm and rxvt palettes available

502759
installation	upgrade
i was trying to upgrade my windows 7 installation to windows 8 via the upgrade asistant and after it checks for incompatible programs and i choose to order it it stops telling me that i need to have 5gb of free space in my c drive

502822
redmine	gitorious
the ultimate goal here is installing and configuring gitorious to work with redmine but i believe the problem is isolated to ubuntu 12.04 and mysql5.5

502827
spaces	delimiter
because your data is separated by spaces make sure the wizard has spaces set as the delimiter

502837
versioning	upgrade
i had heard that once you upgrade from an older versioning of windows to a newer one you could safely delete the windows_old folder but i m concerned about this

basically i want to delete all files and folder about 10 folder and 25 files in the inetpub wwwroot directory however is not deleting the directory

502888
ubuntu	debian
so i decided to uninstall windows 8 pro and then after recovering ubuntu or debian putting it on a virtual machine

502897
icmp	tcp
and that s the reason http traffic never reaches your web server the only traffic permitted is established connections in rule 1 icmp for example ping in rule 2 -a input -p icmp -j accept and ssh in rule 4 -a input -p tcp -m state --state new -m tcp --dport 22 -j accept

502901
profiler	visualvm
i am using a visualvm which is a java virtual machine profiler

502915
versioning	upgrade
it also allows you to upgrade from an older versioning

502916
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you create a new virtual installation with the upgrade edition you ll still have to either install a previous versioning first or activate win8 manually by contacting ms over the phone

502966
put	get
in order to get around restrictions put in place by the windows 8 uac i require my ahk scripts to run as administrator

502984

is it possible to write a script that tries to use zsh and falls back to bash if zsh is not available

503007
filesystems	ntfs
i m trying to convert the fat32 filesystems of an external hard drive to ntfs

503009

bash	zsh
is it possible to write a script that tries to use zsh and falls back to bash if zsh is not available

503012

503050
wmv	ogg
support of avi mov mp4 mpeg ogg wmv and other file formats

503050
decoder	encoder
reason according to me if third party encoder decoder will support the media feature of microsoft is providing then who will buy the media center

503127
mouse	keyboard
it comes with a set of 10+ screen effects that can be activated using keyboard shortcuts mouse gestures or the menubar icon

503169
folder	directory
â if so thatâ s the issue and there is no easy magic fix.â when you move a file from one folder to another on the same volume all that needs to happen is for the operating system to write a new directory entry in the destination folder and erase the old directory entry in the source folder â the file data doesnâ t need to be accessed.â when you copy a file the os must read each data block and write it in a new location.â and a move between volumes might as well be a move between physically separate disks â it must be treated as a copy followed by a delete of the source file â because directory entries cannot point to data blocks on a different volume

503182
daemons	systemd
you will get things running in the systemd or daemons domain

503273
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
note about that i used the linux mint dvd in live mode rather than the ubuntu 12.10 cd which won t boot anyway black screen issue

503281
mouse	keyboard
without a pen though the best you have is either use a long press or a touchpad or mouse accessory like the keyboard cover for the surface

503325
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	xfs
indeed within both this is largely dependent upon rules present within the filesystems format ntfs ext4 xfs and so on

there you will see a list which includes among others hotmail and gmail

mouse	keyboard
xorg blocks all input devices keyboard mouse alt + f 1-12 does not work can t go back to tty1

503623
screens	tablet
i m sure the mail app is fantastic on a tablet but i prefer a less than full screens client that supports flags and adding attachments through file explorer rather than the touch-inspired big tiles without going whole hog to outlook

503659
dns	spf
in order to send that amount of email you need to setup spf possibly some sort of certificate signing use a server with a static ip preferably with reverse dns

503659
put	get
when you start getting even larger you have to contact some email postmasters direct to get put on a white list by submitting legitimate reasons and paperwork

503689
google-chrome	firefox
is there a firefox add-on google-chrome extension that will enlarge gmail compose area

503689

503983
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
whenever i try to update to the latest versioning of java an installation of java 7 update 5 is detected and then i m asked for the file jre1.7.0_05-c.msi which i don t have so then the installation is cancelled and i m left unable to upgrade java

users not differentiating between the projects ffmpeg and libav and their respective command-line tools ffmpeg and avconv

507473
ffmpeg	libav	ubuntu	debian
as a member of libav the ffmpeg maintainer in debian and ubuntu then decided to switch the distro to use libav

507473
ffmpeg	libav
ubuntu switched during the transitional period when libav supplied both their version of ffmpeg and their renamed tool avconv

507473
ffmpeg	libav
when users attempted to use libav s ffmpeg they got the following message

507473
ffmpeg	libav
in this case the ffmpeg mentioned in the message was libav s temporary version which was later removed as was the message

507473
ffmpeg	libav
the main difference for users is that ffmpeg merges many commits from libav but it s not so reciprocal since libav seems to pretend that ffmpeg does not exist and only occasionally cherry-picks from ffmpeg

507473
ffmpeg	libav
for more info see the ffmpeg libav situation

if cdrom is not printed then you probably have to get put in that group to have access to the cd drive

509872
lvm	mdadm
at least one source suggests that it could be made accessible by replacing the missing pv using pvcreate --uuid which would require physically moving a good disk from the mdadm array to the spare machine or buying another new one and apparently requires a backup of the lvm metadata for the vg which i don t have

so some group writes a codec which explains how to decoder from their format back into the raw bitstream and they leave the encoding implementation up to anybody who wants to write a compatible encoder

i have boot an ubuntu version from the same computer separated disk with a linux version for emergencies at least it was useful this time and tried to explore the disk

517583
ubuntu	linux
in such an environment i would normally run a chroot with a custom linux say a debootstrap with ubuntu 12.10

517597
width	height
this leaves me wondering what exactly it is about the stylesheet that is supposedly providing exact specification of location and if anyone has additional thoughts on this please comment because there isn t a single width height 100 or any other positional or locational css--just the font size

517644
ethernet	wireless
i have a computer with two ethernet ports and a wireless adapter

this is because writes to stdout are buffered by the operating system and writes to stderr happen in near real-time

517712
post	get	post	put	put	get
for example i just used folder and then duplicated it to get folder2 that s why the two columns match - unfortunately i haven t found out how to make the taskbar icons multi layered yet you can put an application in the folder and it will launch but it will then show up as the last icon in the task bar and won t actually be a taskbar icon - i hope that makes sense. i ll post back here if i can find a way to fix that - but anyways this is what mine looked like

i want to put a cell on another sheet that searches sheet1 column a for a particular date and when that date is found i want to get a value from another column same row

517815

but it is not possible to get logical levels directly to computer because there is an periphery in chipset that stores data from usb directly to fifo queue and no higher layer does know something about this

517827

this partition is mounted on windows 8 as well as crunchbang debian wheezy and ubuntu 12.10

opera	firefox
i tried opera but when installing it opera automatically imported all my bookmarks and other profile data from firefox folder

517865
opera	firefox
i really had a hard time safely deleting these files that opera made a copy without harming the original files which firefox uses

517877
bash	zsh	stdout	stderr
just a small precision regarding dennis williamson s very useful answer the fairly close part bash s built-in time outputs to stderr while zsh s outputs to stdout

517880
mouse	keyboard
it uses a wired usb keyboard and mouse and they both worked perfectly for several years

517880
mouse	keyboard
then all of a sudden one day the keyboard and the mouse stopped responding after i started the computer

517880
mouse	keyboard
the only working solution for this so far has been to unplug both the keyboard and the mouse and then plug them back in and then all of a sudden they both work again

517880
mouse	keyboard
on wake up everything works again all components initialized again i get the signal and picture on the monitor and everything except for the keyboard and the mouse

517880
mouse	keyboard
i unplug the mouse alone and plug it back in i go to the device manager and i see that both the keyboard and the mouse are recognized by windows

517880
mouse	keyboard
i even tried to swap the connections so that the usb port that the keyboard was connected to gets the port that the mouse was connected to and vice verse

517880
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse are usb

517880
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse are wired

517880
mouse	keyboard
no mentions of keyboard or mouse not working during bios post

517890
post	get
if said computer is in a domain as your post indicates this may not even work at all - the firewall will get reconfigured on a gp update if there is a gpo that configures it

517901
google-chrome	firefox
at first i thought this was just a change mozilla had made to firefox but then i noticed it also happened in google-chrome

517905
stdout	stderr
the main problem is that the file both.txt will not show the messages stderr and stdout in the correct order

517905
stdout	stderr
that stdout is a buffered stream while stderr is always unbuffered

517905
bash	subshell
the best alternative i could find was using bash subshell is kind of complex and still does not display the output in the correct order

517905
stdout	stderr
i made a simple perl script test.pl that prints out to stdout and err to stderr repeating the process 3 times

517905
stdout	stderr
now this works inasmuch as it creates 3 files one with stderr one with stdout and one with both

517908
debian	linux
i ve got a headless server running debian linux currently

517914
opera	firefox
that means you would have to create another user to run opera with and deny them permission to the firefox folder or just lock down the firefox folder so no one can get to it until after you have installed and launched opera for the first time

517946
ssdp	upnp
i have a port specifically port 2869 for windows media player network sharing service that uses upnp port 2869 however even when turning off all the sharing possibilities i can think of and stopping the service from the services list as well as stopping ssdp discovery and then adding registry keys when i open wmp the port still opens itself on cmd netstat -aon

517958
ubuntu	linux
i installed a linux ubuntu server inside my home lan initially it s automatically configured to use dhcp interface

517965
debian	linux
windows doesn t work like debian linux and there is no replacement utility for apt-get or rpm

decoder	encoder
as for ffmpeg alsa and v4l2 are called input devices not codecs not that the term codec is always accurateâ i generally call something an encoder and or decoder to be more specific

i moved the mouse to c and still the same situation keyboard worked but mouse didn t unless i unplug and plug back in

518011
mouse	keyboard
this time both the mouse and the keyboard worked

518011
mouse	keyboard
for the last time i flipped the mouse from a to b and the keyboard from b to a shut down started up and everything worked

518011
mouse	keyboard
then i plugged in the usb hub to d once again shut down started up again and both the mouse and keyboard worked this time

518011
mouse	keyboard
if both mouse and keyboard work now then plug in the remaining usb

looks like when choosing the euro symbol you get the choice of putting it before or after the number and you chose to put it after

518040

if you chose to put it before you d get the same display with the symbol way over to the left

518063

it really quickly showed the screen checking filesystems ntfs filesystems is clean but i still have the same problem

518193
dns	spf
now the sender id and spf are solely focused on your dns server- they have nothing to do with your email server at all

518203
octal	hex
this abuses the â œrepeatâ binding functionality by using it to stay in â œprefix modeâ while basically ignoring the first byte of the utf-8 encoding of ã¹ hex c3 b9 octal 303 271

518252
rpm	yum
- are the yum and rpm databases ok

518275
hid	keyboard
and stupidly plugged in my main machine and i was shocked to discover that it s detected as an usb hid and keyboard

518277

so here is what happens if i remove the octal 0240 or hex xa0

518277
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	hex
i found the od octal dump tool quite useful to show me what the actual hex oct binary values for the whole line are

518309
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
asus only states that it can read fat 16 32 ext2 3 and ntfs filesystems so you have to choose one of them

518340

since you probably don t want to disable support for usb hid and keyboard devices i don t think there is anything you can do to prevent such attacks other than not plugging untrusted devices into your machine

518483
installation	upgrade
those two setups are set on installation how the cpu will treat the data will it use 32-bit buses or 64-bit buses addresses etc. and cannot be simply upgrade

518489
disk	ram
additionally the cpu is only one component that may be taking execution time and as such if its waiting on disk or high frequency ram updates then the cpu would still act exactly as you have described despite the app being multithreaded and on a multicore chip

518496
cpu	processors
bottom line is that if you re wondering what it takes to max out cpu usage as much as possible the answer is takes a cpu-intensive activity with as many threads as you have processors doesn t block on i o and runs at higher priority just being the foreground app than other tasks

518498
ethernet	wireless
in summary two wireless internet sources into the house of which either is broadcasting and two ethernet devices which need to link to either wireless network

to protect your pc from viruses spyware rootkit etc it is essential to have some form of antivirus protection installed and to have a firewall enabled for alot of people windows firewall will suffice.

518548
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
since i don t know anything about rundeck take my advice with a large grain of salt but if you are getting a no tty present message from sudo most probably sudo ing into this account from which ever account you are coming from is not allowed with a nopassword directive in the sudoers file and it is expecting you to enter a passwd

518575
disk	ram
the raidz will be three 1.5gb disk and i m wondering if zfs won t work with 2 gb of ram

518605

uncontrolled shutdown is worse with myisam tables they need to be flushed to disk before shutdown or major data corruption occurs they re not transactional like innodb which attempts to do integrity checks if bad shutdown without flushing data to disk occurred

520229
fflush	gets
the operating system shutdown process should properly fflush the mysql tables but i ve been caught out just often enough on both wamp and lamp workstations to know that every so often the shutdown gets forced before the tables complete being written out that i always manually control shutdown

most tools will report the size of the windows directory incorrectly due to the fact that the winsxs folder uses hard links so the file may show up in two places but it only takes up the hd space once windows explorer spacemonger and windirstat all report this the incorrect way so it is not taking up as much as you think

520581
switching	screens
du included a few more files than the windows properties screens that is why it is not exactly the same numbers for the -u switching

520615

vim	emacs
instead of some bash scripts you can use some scripts for vim or emacs that run as wrappers around git so you can use git commands without leaving the editor

520947
vim	emacs
a great git plugin for vim is fugitive some emacs git plugins are listed here

tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
vpn clients can be set up to shut off all routing to the local internet gateway and home lan to route all the traffic from your computer through the vpn tunnel to the remote lan which then makes the internet traffic come from the remote lan s internet gateway router

522244
vpn	lan
they also can be set up to do split routing where all the vpn routed traffic from your computer goes to the remote lan it represents and all other traffic goes directly from your computer to your local home network and internet gateway

522626
filesystems	ntfs
can ntfs or any other filesystems for that matter assign a file

522626
filesystems	ntfs
you can also mount another partition within a mounted ntfs partition you can mount another partition at c mynewvol if the files are stored within another filesystems

522626
filesystems	ntfs
thus you can access the vbr through the ntfs filesystems assuming you have the proper permissions to do so but you can t directly access the mbr

522781
ethernet	wireless
a point of clarification i am using lan to refer to devices connected via ethernet cable and wlan to devices connected to the wireless access point

522788
debian-based	linux
boot from a linux livecd usb and try gparted or perhaps from gparted s own debian-based livecd usb

522846
google-chrome	firefox
i thought i might try to update the firmware to see if that might help more smart attributes reveal themselves but for some reason i m unable to download the latest firmware in google-chrome internet explorer or firefox

522847
wan	lan
ics will translate and route the internet traffic to and from the first lan between the vista machine and the router s wan port and then the router will translate and route that traffic in and out of the second lan the wireless network

522911
wan	lan
assuming your system has 2 ethernet devices eth0 and eth1 and eth0 is connected to your lan say ips 192.168.1.x and your eth1 device is connected to your isp wan you re going to want to use the following ifconfig command to get your ip for the wan side

522911
wan	lan
if you need to find this out from a system that sits only on the lan you could setup a passphrase-less ssh key and add it to an account on your lan machine so that it could remotely access the system with the wan access like so

522979
ati	nvidia
1 i would like to replace my card with a card that has support for ati nvidia driver that supports outputting 3d formats

522979
ati	nvidia
can both ati hd3d and nvidia 3d vision output standard hdmi 3d frame packing such that i can just use a 3d tv+tv s shutter glasses instead of using the nvidia kit

522998
disk	ram
the reason for putting boot on a partition separate from the regular root file system is that you can reduce on-disk file system complexity which reduces the demands on the boot loader to bootstrap the kernel and initial ram disk

522998
ssd	sata
maybe a ssd these days or a 10krpm drive running off a separate controller channel that last is less a consideration nowadays when every sata disk is on a separate channel but could make a difference back in the pata days

523051
put	get
if you have a linux machine you can put an interface into monitor mode use tcpdump wireshark to capture packets and try to get information about what modulation schemes are actually in use by looking at the radiotap headers

the error is very likely logged either to one of the systemd logs by way of the syslog daemons to the kernel log reviewed using dmesg or both

523063
installation	upgrade
to upgrade from 32 to 64 you need to run clean installation by booting directly from your new cd of 64 bits

523125
antivirus	norton
so for example norton antivirus software cannot be booted

523143
cpu	processors
since your current cpu has a lower tpu than the cpu that the cooler came with it s more than adequate for cooling the newer processors

523176
jobs	cron
i believe having this account run the cron jobs is best because it s more of a general account and should i leave the company one day at least they won t have to worry about any cron jobs that might be destroyed if they should destroy my user account on the server however i m having a difficult time getting this working mainly because my postgres user account is not able to see the same ruby environment i think

523186
post	get
try pressing f8 as windows just loads before you get to the error screen usually i will mash on f8 as the post completes

here is my question is it possible using some tool to convert jfif files to exif format

523338
exif	jfif
what i want know if convert them from jfif back to exif without a second loss of quality if possible...

523351
exif	jfif
the jpeg standard has a number of file compliancy variations which were created for specific reasons two types which are often used are exif and jfif

523351
exif	jfif
when a exif file is opened in an imaging program like photoshop and then saved the file is changed into a jfif format with a result that the image can no longer be opened by the camera and the shooting data is lost

523419
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
in my current setup i need to use sudo to chmod and chown to correct everything

523541
filesystems	hfs+
the default os x filesystems hfs+ works in linux

523553
ubuntu	centos
but in practice you want distros with better support and a long life cycle like centos rhel ubuntu lts etc... - and you can make them lightweight if you need to disable unneeded services

523554
debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
the big advantage with centos and debian and ubuntu is that you have a set of packages that are stable and you d know that its been tested in a larger scale environment

523557
mouse	keyboard
rather than uninstalling microsoft mouse and keyboard center disabling ipoint.exe in startup worked for me

523557

locate the items that read microsoft mouse and keyboard center in the startup item column

523560
macports	homebrew
i have homebrew installed i recently removed macports for homebrew since you cannot have both macports or homebrew installed on the same machine might remove homebrew and return back to macports

523562
bash	zsh
as i use zsh at home and bash on my vps i would like the script to be portable or switch behaviors according to shell but i would be content with already one solution for either environment

523689
mouse	keyboard
in particular i am interested to know if hardware key loggers can be embedded inside a usb of a wifi mouse or keyboard

523696
ffmpeg	handbrake
actually you don t really need to use handbrake if you can use ffmpeg which handbrake relies on anyway

523699
hid	keyboard
second case i could imagine some kind of encryption which would obviously break compatibility as a standard hid device keyboard

523776
folder	dir
remove the a-h-s options to include hidden and system folder dir s b l ad-l-r

523784
filesystems	fat
this is a problem because it s a fat filesystems

523784
filesystems	fat
on a fat filesystems the entries in any given directory are unsorted causing the tree-walk to be unsorted

523786
filesystems	fat
well we ve come a long way since the fat filesystems

if you want to move the contents of a source directory and all of its sub-directories to a single destination directory flatten the folder structure it s very easy and you don t even need to bother with the command line

523869
folder	directory
even after reboot nothing comes back and i am unaware of any gitolite directory other than in the home folder so i have been unable to locate any log files or configuration files

524066
flash-memory	floppy
ssds which also use flash-memory often employ the trim command to reduce the amount of data being written but sd cards rarely if ever use that. these tricks extend the life of an sd card or flash-drive by enough to make them good enough to replace not only floppy drives for general usage but even cd-rw dvd+rw which have write limits of 1 000-10 000 not to mention all the problems with packet-writing in general

524066
ready	each
as such each sector of the file is already available and ready to be written

undelete files from fat exfat ntfs and ext2 filesystems

524150
folder	directory
in those systems some folder that had known names in windows xp are mapped to the new locations using ntfs directory junction points

524150
robocopy	xcopy
if they are not the same then in order to copy your data correctly you have to use a program that understands ntfs directory junction points and can copy them as well one of such programs is microsoft robocopy or plain xcopy

524167
mouse	keyboard
whenever i press or hold down a key on my keyboard my mouse will become unresponsive as long as the key is down and a second or two after i let go

524167
mouse	keyboard
i play pc games and you have to use the keyboard and mouse at the same time

524181
cpu	processors
your laptop processors generates heat and if it gets too hot it will damage the cpu and thus a shut down is required to prevent damage

524186
filesystems	btrfs
first off yes i did in fact suspect that changing my filesystems from ext4 to btrfs would break grub and fstab

524186
filesystems	btrfs
i converted the filesystems seamlessly to btrfs and that worked great

524220
keynote	iphoto
acceleration such as keynote presentations and iphoto slideshows

524239
filesystems	btrfs
make sure you also replace ext4 with btrfs now that you ve changed your filesystems type

524249
width	height
you can then set the height width x y to whole pixel units

524249
width	height
if your height width are odd then just set y x to half a pixel or you can just use a corner or edge reference point

524249
photoshop	fireworks
so while fireworks might be more suited to pixel-precise design it s still fairly doable in photoshop with a little practice

hfs+ filesystems designed by apple have native means to address the storage of this information

when i tried editing your post to insert the uncorrupted images i had to try several times on each one to get the upload to work

eac rips a wav file first then creates a flac file and then deletes the wav file

when selecting the nas drive for storage of the flac files the wav files are stored there too

the extend filesystems command seems to be an undocumented feature which corrects the usable capacity of the ntfs partition still seems strange to me why ntfsclone causes the issue in the first place

for example if you changed it to say 192.168.1.2 32 or 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.255 it would explain the problem any request outside of its lan ie anything else than from 192.168.1.2 32 would then be routed to the default gateway if there are no specific routes saying something more precise and that default gateway is probably on another interface altogether wan

i always have trouble running bash scripts under zsh as there seems to be quite a few differences between the two languages

or you may well have created the gedit emacs vim plugins when you compiled everything it depends on compile settings - if so see the docs for how to start those in supercollider-mode

temp	junction
launch photoshop with ctrl + alt held down to invoke scratch disk selector or create a hard link junction to your sdd drive s temp directory

temp	junction
a permanent solution is to manually create a temp directory somewhere on your data drive and then create another junction hard link that fools the os into thinking that the temp drive is in fact on your boot c drive

529116

now look for any occurrence of temp or tmp and type in the full path to the hard link you created on your c drive

i m sure the problem must be with windows as running linux mint or ubuntu on it suffers from none of the same slow downs

529941
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems design sometimes one filesystems is just better than another and since linux is a hotbed of filesystems research while ntfs has been relatively stagnant this would not surprise me

protected-mode	real-mode
protected mode made this reserved memory a gap in the address space protected mode programs can t call functions from bios without significant hacks rendering it unusable in protected and long mode which every modern os runs in but transfering software from rm to pm was not rapid so intel engineers left an escape hatch v8086 mode which allowed to run old real-mode programs in a sandbox inside protected-mode environment for example os 2 used v8086 mode intensely and dos emulation in windows system also relies on this feature still requiring bios services for compatibility

530274
ubuntu	linux
additionally i can cite the fact that popular linux distributions like ubuntu for instance consider this setup quite stable - their stable livecds have implemented this setup for quite a while now

by the way with ram amount maxed out at 32gb and with about 10gb used for programs most of the time i d get something like 20gb for disk cache at best

531564
disk	ram
on the other hand srt can use up to 64gb of dedicated disk cache - on top of the ram cache available and the 64gb ssd costs only a little higher than the 16gb of ram i ve been contemplating

531571
chown	sudo
it would be a good idea to make sure you own the directory first with sudo chown tarabyte.tarabyte media external

531587
folder	directory
i have a directory which contains sub folder which contain files with very diverse names from many different users so they are not named very consistently

531599

ethernet	wireless
a possibility would be to buy a wireless access point or wireless router and connect its lan port to your mac s ethernet port

531956
ethernet	wireless
then you connect to the wifi with the macbook and share that connection through ethernet to the wireless access point

531969

of course imagemagick can also be installed on other unix systems apt-get install imagemagick on debian and ubuntu

given this setup with an ssd cache would putting 2x3tb sata 3.0 gb s drives in raid 1 slow down the speed dramatically

531985
google-chrome	firefox
many people experience such issues due to either skype or the ie firefox google-chrome plugin for skype

531991

however certain ssd s can greatly benefit from 6gbs as single drive volumes can get very close to the sata 3 limit of 6gbs

532141

532186
ethernet	wireless
connect a powerline adapter to an ethernet connection on your router and the other to a socket where you have weak wireless signal and plug in a second wireless access point

532186
ethernet	wireless
this is similar to your option 2 but the second ap is connected via ethernet to your network and is not repeating the wireless signal

532223
hash	md5
you can use the md5 muxer in ffmpeg to compute and print the md5 hash of all input audio and video frames without the need for intermediate files

532223
mp3	flac
in this example the flac was created from the mp3 lossy to lossless usually not a recommended procedure but this is just a demonstration

532223

there is also the framemd5 muxer to compute and print the md5 hash for each audio and video packet

x86	64bit
however the exact location may differ as some parts of that path may be different for each machine for example if you are running 64bit os then program files will be called program files x86 likewise the number after office will differ depending on the version of office you have installed in this case office12 refers to office 2007

intel requires that for use of smart response technology srt within rst your os must be on either a hdd or hdd raid via the sata connections i believe and a unused ssd be available for ssd caching

532565

you must be sure that your ssd is connected to the z77 or z68 sata ports or it won t be recognized and you won t get the acceleration button link in the rst software

532565
ssd	sata
... my ssd happened to be plugged into the extra ones not the z77 native ones so i could see and access it in windows explorer but not in the rst software not in the raid config that blips on boot up and not in the bios either when i accessed sata

532700
ssd	sata
a fast ssd raid does not factor in this since it is per channel and you would put each ssd on its own sata channel

532705
openvpn	iptables
so any traffic destined for 192.168.100.0 goes through the openvpn interface but is destined for 200.1 because my openvpn box has 2 eth connections and has iptables setup to route that traffic

i have seen cases where the only solution was to completely remove google-chrome firefox as well from the system and reinstall

533259
hdd	floppy
historically they ran from cd and allowed to saved data on floppy hdd or usb still can do working purely from usb is a natural evolution for them

533354
ubuntu	linux
see i use gedit for mac and connect to either an ftp location or to my local ubuntu linux server in a vm

533358
filesystems	ntfs
the errors you re getting about permissions are due to the fact that on an ntfs filesystems the user permissions on each folder are associated with the user s sid which is a unique identifier assigned to each user account

533358
put	get
if you attach a hard drive from computer a to computer b and boot off the hard drive installed in computer b the operating system doesn t know about the user accounts on computer a which is why you get prompted to put in your admin credentials to access the files

533360
versioning	upgrade
i recently installed a fresh copy of windows 8 pro full versioning not an upgrade onto my desktop self-built

533370
folder	directory
if your batch file can fit into one line and so many characters then just use a shortcut by right clicking inside a folder put in a random directory and skip through the rest of the wizard and lastly right click on the shortcut just created and click properties and under target input what you would usually put in a bat file

533377
sudoers	passwd
however their command line program using same package format requires my passwd i am a sudoers though

533405

no you generally can t source non-trivial bash scripts in zsh without some modification

533405
bash	zsh
although bash and zsh have considerable feature crossover implementation details do differ in some respects

533433
folder	directory
the idea is to take differential backups new files and folder since last backup but with no old backups at hand instead by comparing the source directory against a database containing information of last backed up state

533451
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
windows formats usb drives as ntfs by default fat is really old and what type of filesystems you want to go with depends on your need

533482
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs new technology filesystems was introduced by windows and has been supported since the early versions of windows

533482

if i turn off the mobile account option in directory services on the mac and log in i can see my network home folder on the dock which is great but isn t available offline for obvious reasons

533505

535993
mouse	keyboard
anyway uninstalling ai charger worked for me however my issue was that i have a board that has only one ps2 slot on the back meaning i could have a keyboard or mouse when the usb was still disabled

535993
mouse	keyboard
i had to plug in the mouse use the on screen keyboard to get logged in and then uninstall.

536008
decoder	encoder
this only makes sense for variable bit rate encoding where instead of using a constant bit rate or constant quality model the encoder simulates a transmission with a virtual buffer at the decoder

536043
glibc	strace
you basically need to create a directory home you usr which is your local equivalent to usr and convince the build scripts of libraries such as glibc and gtk to use home you usr for everything -- when in doubt run the config script with strace -ff -eopen if you can and see what files it accesses in usr and then google a way to get it to look in home you usr instead

536121
folder	directory
cd â change directory - move to a specific folder

536121

536176
openbsd	freebsd
personally after using openbsd and freebsd for many years i ve grown to like their way of doing things for example the ports tree

536196
lan	localhost
by default webmatrix binds to localhost so if you try to use your machine name allow other machines on the lan to view your site it wonâ t work

536206
umask	sudo
this can lead to problems if the umask is more restrictive than 0022 the caller may not be able to access files created by sudo

536206
umask	sudo
the related post how do i tell sudo to write files with a umask of 0022

536206
umask	sudo
for me this fixes the issue uses umask 0022 for sudo but not when switching to root via the su command i m running os x 10.7.5

536209
switching	screens
just do this twice to switching the inner screens

536235
folder	directory
you should have a numbered list of detected os folder even a single boot system will still have one windows directory labeled 1 select the damaged build and you ll be prompted for the passwords and dropped into a shell at the root of c windows or whatver your unique drive letter and directory systemroot

536249
ethernet	wireless
although i m not intentionally running any bandwidth-intensive applications i m programming and frequently executing git commit and pushes they say that the internet is much faster and the problem is fixed when they pull out my ethernet cable which puts me back on wireless internet

536249
ethernet	wireless
i m not sure why wireless internet users don t affect the network latency of wired users at least in our case when they pull out my ethernet cable and put me on wireless internet they say there s no more lag

536258
ssd	sata
my motherboard is a gigabyte ga-z77x-up4 th and my ssd which the os is installed on is a samsung 840 series 2.5 inch 120gb sata iii

536319
integer	unsigned
the annoyance here is due to the fact that the registry editor doesn t interpret the 32 bits as anything other than an unsigned decimal integer or a hexadecimal representation of binary data

536319
hex	binary
so -1 will have a binary value of 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 hex ff ff ff ff

536319
integer	unsigned
if you translate that into an unsigned decimal integer like the registry editor does you get 4 294 967 295

536319
integer	unsigned
so for our purposes 0 equates to 4 294 967 296 which you can simply add your negative number to in order to get the unsigned decimal integer you need that the registry editor saves in binary form and that the system will later interpret as a negatively-signed integer

536321
packets	multicast
there are two things that stop your multicast packets from reaching the entire world

536321
packets	multicast
the usual thing is that a router upstream from you will either not route multicast packets at all or it won t route any that come from you

536321
packets	multicast
just to clarify routers will not just pass along your multicast packets to other networks until they have been configured to do so and moreover the network administrator may choose to block any incoming multicast traffic that arrives from certain ports

536345
post	get
if you get errors messages stop and post them here so we can better understand the problem

536358

536374
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
for linux tested on fedora ubuntu mint and others

536376
unix	bsd	bsd	xnu
xnu is a hybrid kernel consisting of the mach microkernel with components of a more traditional monolithic bsd unix kernel

in linux ubuntu mkvmerge gui is an excellent tool but.

536543
ftp	telnet
by default terminal is the application that handles ssh ftp and telnet urls as well as x-man-page for viewing man pages

mp3	wav
i could convert it to wav use sox then convert it back to mp3 again and copy the metadata minus the duration from the original to the new mp3

536550
google-chrome	firefox
you didn t really provide enough information to recommend anything here but i ll stab at it for good measure it kinda sounds like there s a proxy set in ie and google-chrome that is not set in firefox or vice versa so check those settings

536576

536582
ubuntu	centos
redhat centos is different from ubuntu

536582
postgresql	mysql
that can be mysql or postgresql

536598
filesystems	ntfs
from these raw sectors the ntfs filesystems driver tells the operating system the information about the sectors on the disk where the vhd data resides

536598
filesystems	ntfs
before you can read the filesystems within the vhd you first have to read the vhd itself as a file on the underlying ntfs filesystems

536598
filesystems	ntfs
another ntfs filesystems with its own list of files and directories metadata streams file fragments and so on

536613
tunnel	vpn
when you connect to your vpn your tunnel interface is assigned an ip by that remote dhcp server

536665
rpm	yum
is there a way to manually install a package locally without yum or apt-get or rpm or make

536684
ubuntu	centos
another important thing is that my server is an ubuntu 12.04 and client centos 6.3

536687
folder	directory
assumes all folder are in same parent directory

536693
filesystems	fat
ufs drives are meant for vfat and some are set up for it special handling of the fat and so on so formatting them with another filesystems might not be the best idea

well i finally managed to get linux chuck and pulseaudio to work together - so that i could run the chuck script from that post s accepted answer together with say vlc or a youtube flash and have their respective audio outputs automatically mixed.

537032

i also updated file ownership with sudo chown root library launchagents agenttest.plist

537206
gmail	hotmail
strengths it gets the image into the html preserves nearly all your carefully crafted html i haven t yet found anything it significantly distorts apart from the notes below and it includes the image as an id-referenced content-transfer-encoding base64 in the email header - the proper way to embed images in html email which in my testing shows the image by default without prompts or warnings when received in outlook 2011 gmail and hotmail

537206
google-chrome	firefox
open the html in google-chrome using firefox causes any anchor links to be pointed at the original file on your local system

in ubuntu or previous releases of fedora you could install grub to the linux partition and then add an entry to bcd using easybcd or dd-ing partition s first 512 bytes to a file to boot it

537398

i tried moving mnt apps lib libc.so.6 temporary to another location but i get the message it is a readonly file system

the server is ubuntu 12.04 and the client is centos 6

537499
gmail	hotmail
both microsoft and google provide whitelist services for hotmail and gmail respectively

537500
stdout	stderr
the problem is that only lines that begin with or get sent to stdout while lines that begin with get sent to stderr

537500
stdout	stderr
sends stderr to stdout so grep is able to filter it

537539
toolbar	tabs
since ui elements have gone as mentioned above and it is only accessible by shortcut alt + s + t or toolbar menu history tabs from other devices

537550
google-chrome	firefox
if you boot windows load firefox google-chrome play a couple of games you will see a huge boost in load times for those features regardless of how much memory you have

537550
ssd	sata
you plug your intel ssd into a special sata port and the mainboard hides it from your os

537582
x86	64bit
as nerdwaller suggested 64bit systems have both program files and program files x86 folders

537615
ramdisk	lvm
system half-boots from that place and loads the raid + lvm + crypt kernel modules from the ramdisk

537627
google-chrome	firefox
this setup works fine in firefox and ie but in google-chrome the servername s that do not follow a recognised tld are instead resolving to a google search for that string google search opencart.local for instance

537668
traceroute	packets
this leads me to believe that the traceroute packets are not getting forwarded to 10.23.29.10 like the routing table says that they should be

537766

the oldest versioning of windows you can upgrade from is windows vista depending on which versioning of windows 7 we are talking about

537806
versioning	upgrade
the oldest versioning of windows eligible for an upgrade to windows 7 is windows xp

537806
versioning	upgrade
what s the difference between the upgrade and full versioning of windows 7

537806
versioning	upgrade
when purchasing windows 7 you can choose either an upgrade versioning or full versioning

537806
versioning	upgrade
both upgrade and full versioning include the same features

537806
versioning	upgrade
upgrade versioning require that windows xp or windows vista are installed on your computer before installing windows 7

537806
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
to upgrade an earlier operating system than windows xp for example windows 95 or windows 2000 you ll need to purchase a full versioning of windows 7 and perform a custom installation

537806
versioning	upgrade
the oldest versioning of windows that you can do an in-place upgrade as opposed to a clean install from is windows vista

537806
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
in your case though since you re starting with a clean slate and don t have an existing windows installation with programs and data you need to preserve the versioning to get is windows xp which you can then upgrade to windows 7 with a clean aka custom install

537830
ubuntu	linux
grab a linux livecd such as ubuntu boot into the livecd mount both the drive you are trying to recover from and the drive you are trying to recover to and copy paste your data

537937
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
supposing the program you re using is just insisting on having a case-insensitive fs while your data is on a case-sensitive fs you can sometimes get away with just mirroring the directory structure over to the case-insensitive fs and use symbolic links for the files

537937
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
for instance consider you want to clone foo.app which resides in a case-sensitive fs to a case-insensitive fs which we assume here to be the root filesystem you might do something like

537940
folder	directory
or do have it done recursively all files folder under a directory

so every 64bit cpu is also a 32-bit cpu and a 16-bit cpu as well

541218
disk	ram
of course windows would normally write to disk only the contents of ram which you can easily check by openening task manager with ctrl alt del and going to performance tab so you might want to check a few dozens times how much memory is used during your normal work or at the state you might put your computer to sleep and reduce the hiberfil.sys size

541220
disk	ram
if hibernatemode is 3 var vm sleepimage takes up the same amount of disk space as the amount of ram you have

if you have backups it might be a good idea to do some md5 or sha1 hash on the backups and your home directory and diff them to spot any changes but as long as you restored teh missing files the files that stuck around shouldn t suffer any corruption

541945
ethernet	wireless
i am wondering if there is any sort of adapter that i could plug in a ide hdd into and it would offer something similar to a nas-server on a ethernet or wireless wifi network anyone have any suggestions

541965

because most individuals typically do not have 5+ computers running two octa-core processors 32gb of ram and raid 10 arrays lets work under the realistic assumption that these boxes are modern off-the-shelf 500 win 7 pcs with dual core cpu s 4gb ram and a single 500gb hdd

542112
filesystems	ntfs
and i copied some private files include folders from ext filesystems to ntfs filesystems partition operated on linux

you could use some of that ram to create a ram disk

542378
disk	ram
however there s a huge difference between ssds and ram disk

542378
disk	ram
if your computer suddenly loses power crashes hangs or reboots everything that was in ram and on your ram disk will be lost

542397
ubuntu	linux
from the linux end as of now i m using ubuntu but my actual requirement will be for a stripped down version of linux for an arm based machine

542443
ubuntu	linux
maybe you should try another live linux distribution like ubuntu

542598
ati	nvidia
virtualization kills gpu performance applies to older cards like ati 5770 but not nvidia gt 640

542621
winpcap	wireshark
you ll need to run wireshark as an admin unless iirc for windows i m mainly a linux guy you install winpcap which also gets installed along with wireshark to allow anyone to do sniffing

542689
filesystems	ntfs
yet refreshing the gparted s display would still show my hard drive as being ntfs filesystems with about 6gb used

this doesn t change the keyboard mouse equation

543108
pop-up	dialog
the new import excel data button will pop-up a file dialog to choose your excel file

543133
cpu	processors
faster processors generally have the same base clock speed with a higher cpu multiplier so the memory is still running at the same speed

543147
debian	linux	debian	mint
these are from my linux mint debian edition

543153
cpu	processors
i am thinking back to when i dealt with a dual xeon processors workstation a while back and it had 3 dimm banks for each cpu

543158
children	parent
it s more important with apache and the process model because typically apache has a parent child relationship with the parent being a controller that forks reaps children

543158
children	parent
if you want to take the server down you need to send a signal to the parent not to the children

543187
width	height
set the width and height of screen buffer size to a large value if the value is not large enough cmd.exe will still not go fullscreen

ethernet	wireless
is it possible to set one port on the modem as bridge and trace a ethernet cable to the other building where it will be plugged into an wireless router which will use virtual circuits to both offer wired iptv and wifi internet

543464
mouse	keyboard
secondary generic hubs may be internal to your computer motherboard may be an external hub you plug in or may be internal to a device you attach the high-end gaming keyboards and mice usually contain an internal usb hub and then all the extra special macro keys actually show up as a second separate usb device from the keyboard or mouse itself

543469
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way in google-chrome to group tabs like there is in firefox

543476
ubuntu	centos
i am in the process of migrating from ubuntu server over to centos

543476
ubuntu	centos
while i can easily configure mpd as a system wide service on ubuntu i am having difficulty with centos

543486
vmware	virtualbox
lastly if you can get the hardware acceleration of vmware or virtualbox to work it should also be possible to get it working at decent speed

543505
switching	screens
typically the right control key is the host key - which assists with the capture and release of the mouse cursor and other features like switching between full screens mode and windowed

543506
tunnel	packets
so to kgraves-pc the rdp session is being sent to the localhost which is then forwarded via ssh tunnel through devilsmilk to duclaw but the rdp packets that are being received in response to that connection are received directly from duclaw

google-chrome	firefox
my university website is designed in such a way that just users with internet explorer can use it and if you try to access it through other browsers like google-chrome or firefox it wont allow

543650
filesystems	ntfs
it is actually more dangerous to use an offline defragger as you are now entrusting the integrity of the ntfs filesystems to third-party code that may not understand all the features of ntfs

543662
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
i think ffmpeg can t do that â m4a files store metadata in a strange way compared to flac or mp3 or ogg

543784
google-chrome	firefox
additionally unlike firefox and google-chrome microsoft clearly notes which patches are security patches versus functionality patches which always come with a major version change from microsoft

543784
google-chrome	firefox
this means that enterprises that use internet explorer won t ever get into a situation where all of their intranet stopped working over the weekend because of a patch pushed out to google-chrome or firefox without the it network admin having checked and authorised the patch

543784
google-chrome	firefox
with firefox and google-chrome you re on your own

543784
google-chrome	firefox
to a big company that reads as with microsoft the risk of something going wrong is a quantifiable risk with google-chrome and firefox there is an unlimited risk

543875
sudo	passwd
this script opens a shareable connection to the remote server so you only have to enter you ssh passwd once then copies your shell script over and finally executes it using the normal ssh command which allows it to allocate a tty and thus allows your passwd to be entered for sudo in a relatively secure way

543889
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i am using debian linux and ubuntu linux systems on my computers

543900

in bash and zsh and probably others you can use typeset -f to list all functions

543947

i love tmux speed and tmux.conf clarity of configs over screens and screenrc but this one item is keeping me from switching users over

544147
disk	ram
all you re doing is messing with the recovery environment s own accounts which only exist on the ram disk so any changes disappear the moment you reboot

544196

i ve heard that such services exist for ubuntu and opensuse

544937
ctrlp	fuzzyfinder
use edit write your own mappings for custom locations or use one of the various file finder plugins fuzzyfinder ctrlp ... found on vim.org

544974
ftp	telnet
this file is mostly just a copy of etc services from an old version of bsd â since windows uses the same bsd sockets api and even brought in various client programs ftp telnet rsh finger commands from it it needs an services file in order for the getservbyname function to work

544974
ftp	telnet
and only legacy clients like telnet or ftp use the service names to connect

544974
ftp	telnet
on windows i m sure the file is used even less â i can t remember any program that uses it other than the same ftp and telnet tools

545521
disk	ram
i suspect it requires that an index of key frames are in ram and that it is cheap to jump to any disk block which contains a key frame it s in ram too

545521
disk	ram
on top of this the disk plus file system must be able to stream video data at 1 x speed starting with only the key frame block in ram

545536
debian	linux
i have a debian server exporting folders to three mac laptops and a linux one through nfs with no problems

545580

if i had a 500 gb ssd and a 1 tb hdd installed on one computer could i use the 1 tb hdd as a dedicated server using linux mint or ubuntu server edition as the os

545719
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
but would the server still be active like me and others can still access it while i m on my other os or would i have to setup a virtual machine within windows to run it and still keep the linux mint ubuntu server edition in the 1 tb hdd

545727
ubuntu	debian
i believe that checkinstall can build packages for dpkg-based systems ubuntu debian etc. rpm-based systems fedora rhel etc. and slackware-based systems

545796
mouse	keyboard
they would in essence have their own vm but the trick is to eliminate mouse and keyboard

545824
vmware	virtualbox
this should work with virtualbox too i think same concept but you can do this with vmware as well

545898
switching	screens
say i had 2 profiles balanced and high performance i want to have the screensaver show while on balanced but if i switching to high performance the screensaver will disable leaving the screens in an always on state

546106
filesystems	xfs
i would suggest simply using your favorite general purpose filesystems be it ext4 or xfs or anything else really with dm-crypt underneath to support the encryption

546106
lvm	xfs
xfs has better features than ext3 like freezing for lvm snapshots but i think ext4 probably evens the playing field

546119
ubuntu	linux
samba keeps it s own password store that can be synced with the linux password and last i checked the default in ubuntu is to turn on syncing but you have to set the initial password with smbpasswd -a

546143
put	get
i have personally done this to both my ssd s on my primary home computer and experienced no issues and it did return my ssd performance back to how it was when i originally installed the ssd s - how to get your ssd performance back - the link will contain instructions on how to perform a secure-erase on your ssd you will be using parted magic and unetbootin to put parted magic on a bootable usb unetbootin is actually an incredibly useful tool because it will allow you to take any bootable .iso file and create a bootable usb flashdrive

546259

much easier would be four worksheet cells where you can type in the desired min max major minor as time values and the chart updates instantly

546818
vim	emacs
alternatively edit the file in a text editor that supports inline editing such as vim or emacs

546848

546998
mouse	keyboard
one solution program that using net allow use one keyboard mouse and clipboard on several laptops who knows another solutions

547001
mouse	keyboard
a if simply using a single keyboard and mouse would be sufficient and you don t need to actually move windows between the systems or access files from one on both etc you can use something like synergy which you mentioned or multiplicity as a kind of virtual kvm

547008
ubuntu	linux
it would be good to try a free linux platform like ubuntu nevertheless

547009
chown	chmod
if it is on the same computer you need to protect your filesystem using chmod chown and protect your web server

547012
versioning	upgrade

547402
width	height
scale videos with a dar 7 4 width-wise change the width to 700 and scale the height to keep the aspect ratio and scale those with dar 7 4 height-wise

547406
width	height
first in your shell define output width and height

547406
width	height
note that the numbers for width and height have to be divisible by 2 in order to work for most codecs

547406
width	height
first we need to figure out whether to scale by width or height

547406
width	height
to do this we divide the output width by the input width and output height by input height

547406
width	height
finally we multiply both input width and height by that factor

547406
width	height
is the output width and height

547406
width	height
to figure out where to place the resulting video we need to subtract the scaled width from the maximum output width and the scaled height from the maximum output height

547409
putty	winscp
in the moment i am trying to delete this directory with putty rm -rf dirname but just like winscp it became unresponsive

many users prefer a plugin manager like vundle or pathogen

547769
opera	google-chrome
as an example one of my national newspapers dagens nyheter use web fonts for their headlines but not their leads so when that site is loaded i usually see the leads first and half a second later all the blank spaces above are populated with headlines this is true on google-chrome and opera at least

547769
opera	google-chrome
i wrote above that i had tested opera and google-chrome who both behaved similarly

547769
google-chrome	safari
all webkit based ones google-chrome safari etc. choose to avoid fout by not rendering web font text with a fallback font during the web font loading period

547769
webkit	blink
addition blink has a bug registered for this too but it seems a final consensus has not been reached regarding what to do with it - currently same implementation as webkit

uptime	reboot
after about 133 days of uptime i reboot it

547796

a daemons is a program that runs in the background as part of the overall systemd that is it is not tied to a particular user

547919
portrait	landscape
maybe there are similar features that can be used to print the landscape document in 1 portrait sheet

547933
daemons	launchd
i would simply like to understand why this is - i thought the while idea of launchd was to start daemons

547933
daemons	launchd
but does that mean that the daemons must run inside launchd for its entire lifetime

547933
daemons	launchd
is there an alternate way of starting daemons with or without launchd that would allow me simply to run a command once at boot

547966
debian	linux
i wonder why are there these two commands on debian linux with very similar names and functionality

ubuntu	mint
i had a similar issue recently while installing mint over a system that d previously been running ubuntu

there shouldn t be any problems on gnu systems gnu grep uses read which avoids all buffering and gnu tail -f makes regular calls to fflush when writing to stdout

548232
udp	tcp
whether the rule should be tcp udp or both and based on the port or .

548235
sudo	passwd
the only issue i had with this was that it could be difficult to enter a passwd for the sudo command when the wrong layout is enabled

548248
hash	md5
for safety you can verify by comparing hash md5 sha-1 of the copy and original backup files

548260
bluetooth	usb
i had to buy bluesoliel for my csr bluetooth usb dongle

548324
folder	directory
is there any way i can make windows server 2003 show the name of folder i opened on start menu then whole directory of it now i got 4 folder opened and they all showing me this

548397
vlan	packets
the network contains a layer 2 managed switch so it is possible to put it on a separate vlan and i suppose i could use a pc with a vlan capable network card rdp into it and then use ie to connect to the phone system however i am looking for a better solution maybe some kind of a bridge that allows translation between the two networks blocking each otherâ s dhcp packets

mouse	keyboard
usually yes although in some cases i ve had to enable usb mouse keyboard support in the bios

548820
kde	gnome
kde and gnome are alternative guis

548820
kde	gnome
linux has guis like kde and gnome

548834
folder	directory
i have plenty of room on my hard drive so figured maybe the best solution would be to just have a secondary directory tree for google drive that would mirror most of the folder from my dropbox folder tree

548856
mouse	keyboard
the system will boot from it and when it does the usb mouse works but the usb keyboard does not

548866
postfix	dovecot
that being said you don t need postfix and or dovecot to send email

548880
cpu	processors
so i want to buy a system with 4 intel e5 processors not yet sure whether the e5-26xx or the e5-46xx cpu s would be the better choice

548880
cpu	processors
when i find a company selling quad cpu workstations they only offer windows server or linux variants as the os choices leading me to believe that perhaps windows 7 does not support more than 2 processors

548887
folder	directory
i have a directory with a bunch of folder in them

vim	gedit
what you should do is edit your etc apt sources.list file to make it look like this you can edit with gedit as superuser or vim using sudo or however you like it the most

548999
put	get
if you re careful about where you put your private key stealing the file is no easy task for example if it lives on a flash drive that you carry on you a remote attacker can t get it

after configuring router b with router a lan going to its wan

549152
wan	lan
for bridging using routera s lan port to routerb s wan port is needed

549203
filesystems	ntfs
the actual problem is that ntfs filesystems are always mounted with permission support by default â since windows sids cannot be automatically mapped to unix accounts without manual configuration creating the usermapping file in ntfs-3g

549209
folder	directory
i say create a folder for the file so that the directory added to the trust center has as narrow a focus on where code can be automatically run

549214
ubuntu	debian
also if you successfully run python setup.py install it may not be easy to uninstall whereas that should always be possible with the official debian packages that ubuntu provides

549226
ubuntu	linux
i can t seem to ssh from my ubuntu ec2 server into my work linux box

versioning	upgrade
i ve just upgrade from preview to office 365 and the problem is present in both versioning but not in the office 2010 that i was using before

549256
wan	lan
does the wlan router have more than one lan port so that its wan interface is connected to the switch

549257
wan	lan
make sure you re plugging it into the wan port on your router it sounds like since the switch pulls an ip when you set the router to dhcp that you actually have it connected to a lan port

549315
disk	ram
cpu diode cpu digital core 0 cpu digital core 1 cpu proximity integrated graphics chip ram disk bay the actual disk also has a sensor battery and there are also a couple more that aren t related to any specific component case sensors

queue	fifo
specifically i d like a single fifo queue for every ip on the internal network and to have packets processed round-robin from those queue such that if only one computer is on the network it can use 100 of the bandwidth but if more are active no one user will be able use all of it

549439
put	get
is it ok to remove and put the battery without turning it off hope to get the answer from someone who had lenovo laptop and done this trick alot

549461
pull	push
is wrong impression - hg-git allow mercurial client interact bidirectionally with remote git-reposiory and can be used if you have mercurial - pull from hg + push to git

549461
bazaar	git
git client - hg repository communication can be implemented in more git-way with bridge support in git for mercurial and bazaar git-remote-hg for your needs

if that s the case for you upgrade to a newer versioning of avconv or ffmpeg

549536
jboss	glassfish
application server like glassfish jboss

549556
put	get
if you put your inittab entry above the system s entry then init respawning and the s01killprocs script will fight it out for a while you may not get to observe that without a running syslog which is probably racy and probably won t do what you want

549574
subnet	packets
very briefly this involves setting up your computer to act similar to the way a normal router acts which means you create a network address translation nat subnet also known as ipv4 masquerading which means that you forward packets sent from eth2 to your computer and the opposite way up through the gateway nic

549584
bash	zsh
what you describe works the same in zsh as it does in bash

549632
ubuntu	linux
installing an independent grub2 is straight forward for always having it point to the current linux ubuntu kernel see my question

549632
ubuntu	debian
menuentry debian or ubuntu

549632
ubuntu	debian
your computer will boot a simple grub2 listing the entries you have specified windows 7 loader debian or ubuntu

549647
mp4	h.264
1 and while there s a difference in file size the fact that it s a few percent means that the only difference is the actual container flv and mp4 and not the video h.264 and audio aac

549648
screens	tablet
often in a rush i tend to forget to lock my desktop and rather than wait for the screensaver to kick in to lock the screens is there a way i can use my mobile android iphone or tablet android ipad to lock my desktop

grab the md5 or sha512 or any other hash function hash from both files if you still have the working source file and compare them

549693
ethernet	wireless
i have a home network consisting of 1 wireless router connected to the internet and then a number of clients directly connected to it on both ethernet and wireless as illustrated below

if i wanted to rename all the files into the base directory renamed to for example folder 2005 - 01.jpg what would be the easiest way of doing this by the command line in linux

549810
vmware	virtualbox
i ve never tried it but i know virtualbox and possibly vmware can create a virtual disk image that actually points to a partition and then you can boot that partition

549818
tunnel	vpn
if yes the most likely reason why your connection to server s drops is because your vpn client was configured to prevent split tunnel

549818
tunnel	vpn
under this sort of configuration the vpn client modifies the normal ip routes so that all traffic leaving the client pc must flow through the vpn tunnel excluding of course the traffic required to establish the vpn tunnel itself

549818
tunnel	vpn
as consequence the session between machine m and server s is not routed via the tunnel to vpn network v and from there redirected to server s on network n

549818
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
the traffic routed to the vpn tunnel will suffer nat before reaching to network n and as consequence server s will reject packets as sequence numbers and other tcp session values on machine m don t match those on server s

549819
tunnel	vpn
if yes the most likely reason why your connection to server s drops is because your vpn client was configured to prevent split tunnel

549819
tunnel	vpn

549819
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
the traffic routed to the vpn tunnel will suffer nat before reaching to network n and as consequence server s will reject packets as sequence numbers and other tcp session values on machine m don t match those on server s

549825
pop-up	dialog
going ahead with the check pop-up a dialog saying

549852
width	height
in the formula the cell reference is b 1 the row offset from b 1 is 0 the column offset from b 1 is 0 the height of the values to be returned is 1 row and the width is 6 columns

549883
google-chrome	firefox
also it is implied that i cannot access web pages from firefox nor google-chrome note i removed the previous proxy setting that i use for pict-wifi

549885
vmware	virtualbox
if you ask around you will find people who recommend vmware instead of virtualbox

549885
vmware	virtualbox
this is not a bad idea in fact of you use or are likely to use vmware at work then it is probably better to install vmware than virtualbox

549903
ubuntu	debian
this is addressed in debian and therefore ubuntu by the multiarch project

549905
sudo	passwd
i would type in passwd on sudo d commands where necessary

549918
ethernet	wireless
connect pc without wireless to bridged computer with crossover cable it may work with regular ethernet cable

549921
mouse	keyboard
it does not seem like there is any way to transparently remap keyboard events into mouse events

549947
jobs	cron
hence it can be used on machines that aren t running 24 hours a day to control daily weekly and monthly jobs that are usually controlled by cron

549985
ubuntu	debian
you probably have perl and therefore in most distributions also the prename command installed often linked to simply rename in debian and ubuntu

549991
google-chrome	firefox
if you are using firefox google-chrome add fanboy s lists secure.fanboy.co.nz to your ad-blocker there are lists which entirely block ads trackers and even facebook like buttons feed icons and more

550021
office365	outlook.com
by subscribing to office365 and possibly outlook.com but i ve not been able to find any information on how to do this

550023
ubuntu	linux
it works as intended though tested on a 32-bit ubuntu 12.04 and a 64-bit suse linux enterprise server 10 sp4

550030
freebsd	linux
i would recommend you do this through gparted on linux but you can probably do it through the freebsd installer as well

550041
filtering	grouping
you can add users who need to modify scheduled tasks remotely to the local administrators grouping via gpo security filtering and configure this gpo with not to allow interactive logon setting or alternatively you can specify on a remote host in advanced system settings specific user accounts which can log in

550088
post	put
i m not sure if this is the right location to post this question i wanted to put it on stackoverflow to try grab the larger number of users who would use jira but it wouldn t let me post question as it had no code..

550161
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
i want it to sort it according to best match first folders actually starting with work case-sensitive first and then any case-insensitive matches

550174
folder	directory
all of my coding projects are in users me sites but the directory in coderunner shows a much higher level so there s a lot of unnecessary folder shown on my screen and if i try to open a project in users me sites it ends up creating a massive sprawl for example there are hundreds of folder inside the sites folder on the left side as i navigate to a project

550180
kde	gnome
i ve installed centos not so long ago installed it both with kde and gnome

550180
centos	linux
so i have no idea which linux distro is good but i like centos sometimes embarrassed with this alt-f1-f8 switches when the system hangs because my computer got only 1.5 gb memory ddr1 xor 2 don t know exactly

550188
width	height
you can see this in the new document dialog change units to pixels type 1 inch in the width or height box and it will change to 72 px

550188
width	height
it s derived from 216 dpi 72 dpi which is equal to 300 but due to rounding issues the width or height will be one pixel off if you use it

550188
width	height
this is the same reason that changing the width from 267 to 800 will give you a height of 479

550221
button	checkbox
now un-tick the checkbox from all result lines and then click on apply button

550221
button	checkbox
now tick the checkbox from all resulted lines and then click on the apply button

550226
vpn	lan
you can configure 2 network adapters in your computer in a such way that the default routing would go through your home lan and only routing to your company internal network would go through the vpn connection

550237
srt	subtitle
find an srt or sub subtitle file and run mp4box -ttxt file.srt

550237
srt	subtitle
when importing srt or sub files mp4box will choose default layout options to make the subtitle appear at the bottom of the video

550275
udp	tcp
then in port forwarding i would make a new rule and spcify the port number tcp udp protocol and the ip address to forward to

550282
mouse	keyboard
the only things connected to the usb ports are the mouse and keyboard

550298
hash	md5
03043fe01867a075a47e2e6f08ddf7fa is the md5 hash for â œswordfishâ

550327
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
if you have firefox safari or opera installed repeat step #4 but obviously this time select other browsers and download and run install_flashplayer11x32_gtbd_chrd_dn_aih.exe instead

550333
sudo	passwd
enter your passwd in terminal if sudo asks for it

550413

i don t know my sudo passwd so i m unable to do sudo operations

550454
centos	linux
i connect from my windows desktop to linux centos vps using pytty authenticating with key stored in pageant

550489
versioning	upgrade
my question is how do i get the 32 bit versioning to upgrade this other computer

550490
installation	upgrade
these problems seem to occur because you upgrade from windows 7 rather than performing a clean windows 8 installation does this problem appear under 5-10 minutes after logging in

550520
move	drag
be very careful not to drag and drop the emails to the newly created pst or outlook will move them from your inbox to the pst

550520
move	drag
drag and drop with the right mouse button instead and when you let go you will be given a small submenu to move copy or cancel

550523
dropbox	skydrive
it will create a folder in the skydrive folder that links to the folder in the dropbox folder

550523
dropbox	skydrive
try and do the same thing with dropbox - let dropbox folder contain the links in stead of skydrive

550523
dropbox	skydrive
attempt to have all three of them share a single folder that does not actually belong to any of them - let t cloud skydrive t cloud dropbox and t cloud googledrive contain only links to t cloud content - and have all three of them sync that way

550523
dropbox	skydrive
edit having dropbox sync linked folder also works so having dropbox and skydrive share a folder not actually belonging to one of them should work

550523
dropbox	skydrive
it seems google drive doesn t sync symbolically linked folders like dropbox and skydrive does

550546
post	get
programs i have experienced this with include text wrangler adobe illustrator chrome to name a few if i get 10 rep before this is answered i will post a screen shot

openfire	ejabberd
the canonical name is usually proxy.domain-name at least in openfire it used to be and ejabberd it is

550593
ssid	wlan
one can connect to the wlan fix the issues like a new ssid to connect to changed password and bring the network to be redistributed back up

550622
range	minimum
the moment a specific ip or ip range eg 192.168.1.100 connects the full speed should be given to that ip all other ips speed should be reduced to the minimum

550625
subnet	packets
i am curious though i didn t configure a static route on each machine but i configured a static route on the gateway the wired router to send vpn packets subnet 10.8.0.x to the vpn server

550653
ubuntu	linux
however the first time you boot ubuntu you ll need to do so by highlighting the linux option and instead of hitting enter pressing f2 or insert twice

550683
tunnel	vpn
not sure i m entirely clear on your existing set up but you can bypass your router using a vpn or proxy tunnel since they generally use ports 80 or 443 which by default are available

550759
nas	qnap

552157
disk	ram
you can set up a ram disk and put your vm vhd file on it

552157
disk	ram
paying alternatives such as primo ramdisk gives you better performance more backup management options and dynamic memory allocation so you can create a 16gb ram disk but it will only use 10gb if that s what the vm size is

afaik the teamviewer vpn is only able to connect to the host running the teamviewer and it doesn t route the traffic to other hosts on the lan the virutal host coz it has a bridged interface

552436
vpn	lan
therefore with only the teamviewer vpn it is not possible to access any hosts on the lan

552436

i am wondering if setting routing manually on your windows 7 workstation can help so that it can route traffics between the teamviewer vpn the 7.7.7.7 network adapter and its lan 192.168.4.0 24 adatper

552443
youtube	vimeo
it has so called generic way for youtube or vimeo simply because these sites have standard url formats for high res video and the script is clever enough to build the url from existing information in the web site some patterns

i am 100 sure it is not related to the web browser â it all happens in firefox google-chrome and ie9 â iâ ve spent lot of time to verify that

i m trying to do what s done in this question but i want to attach it to a context menu on directory so i can right-click on flatten folder and have it do it for me

552768
folder	directory
that is bring all the individual files within that folder up to the current directory then delete the empty directory

552803
ubuntu	linux
what s irritating is that on ubuntu linux 2.6.20-15 x86 it returns the same address every time the program is run

552803
ubuntu	linux
however on ubuntu linux 3.2.0-37 x86 it returns a different address each time

552813

i tried these settings on ubuntu and debian distributions that have 3.2 and 3.4 kernels

552945
ubuntu	centos
my laptop boots from the fedora ubuntu live cd normally.but with centos live cd there seems

552949
cpu	processors
you can consider buying a more powerful cpu and let it handle physx i think that an i7 processors or a high range i5 would deal pretty well with that let the dedicated nvidia gpu handle both graphics and physx this is possible with a drawback in performance or buy another dedicated nvidia gpu for physx computation

552959
ubuntu	linux
i remember older linux ubuntu and others distributions where i could right-click the panel or desktop and select create launcher

552976

after i updated and restarted my computer i got this funny transparent background but only in pop-up dialog menus

553105

553320
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure why there is a performance difference between google-chrome and firefox with these two methods

553343
folder	directory
is there an application that will silently update a local folder containing all the files in a web directory

553343
folder	directory
i have a simple desktop web application html javascript using jquery in a local folder and whenever it is updated i would like the computers in our office to automatically install the update by downloading something like latest.zip automatically through http download not ftp download and let the updater copy the files into the application directory

553383
udp	tcp
as for why you are seeing what you are seeing there is no single rule and it depends on the networking equipment you use but basically when under load the majority of networking equipment simply only delivers a few percentage of the total amount of traffic it should do - whilst udp connections voice skype other will suffer through the magic of tcp it will keep resending and you will get the data in the end - you just see a lot of lag

553396
ethernet	wireless
they are close enough that i connected them with a crossover ethernet cable but windows 7 still wants to use the wireless to let them talk sometimes

553413
ethernet	wireless
pc2 could have an address of 192.168.151.20 on its ethernet interface and 192.168.0.200 on its wireless interface

553449

x86 32-bit to x64 64bit is not supported in any version of windows

553475

after using nginx for a few months which worked pretty well i decided to switch back to apache

553477
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_mime and add the following lines in your httpd.conf or a .htaccess

553496
packets	multicast
maybe your computer is only seeing packets sent to broadcast and multicast addresses

553503
wav	flac
my understanding is that the wav and flac formats are containers for lossless audio

553503
wav	flac
i have seen the flac format as being perhaps better because it is able to losslessly compress audio from say a wav file

553503
wav	flac
however today i noticed that bleep is offering both wav and flac files to download

553509
wav	flac
since flac is all about mathematically lossless compression flac files will be smaller than corresponding pcm-encoded wav files since pcm doesn t allow for lossless compression and just represents the data as-is

553509
wav	flac
so simply put take a wav file with pcm-encoded audio and the corresponding mathematically equal flac file will be a tad smaller

553509
wav	flac
the downside is that flac is not as widely supported as wav

553509
bmp	png
2 â the analogy for images would be that bmp files contain the raw image data in an uncompressed form whereas a lossless png is much smaller but showing the exact same contents

553512
post	get
after pushing the clear cmos button on the back of my asrock z77-itx motherboard i was able to get to bios but the machine failed to post after exiting

553522
wav	flac
flac is a compressed lossless audio stream wav is uncompressed lossless audio stream

553534

now when i load windows i get to the user log in screen and neither keyboard nor mouse works

553556
mouse	keyboard
so my question is how do i restore the default usb drivers to get my keyboard mouse working again

553569
16-bit	64bit
i have seen that cpu s and operating systems have moved upwards in terms of bits from 8-bit to 16-bit to 32-bit and currently to 64bit

553575
int	chars
since 8 bits is itself too imprecise to be very useful for numeric values or even for extended chars sets such as utf-16 words larger than 8 bits allow for much greater efficiency when working with values utilizing more than that many bits of precision and multiples of 8 bits the smallest commonly-used data type are still the natural choice allowing one to store an int quantify of 2 4 or 8 chars in a word without leaving wasted unused bits

i have a mac g5 desktop with 14gb of ram installed which i sometimes use as a start up disk

553785
ati	nvidia
but they re both for connecting second virtual monitor and they re working only with ati nvidia graphics adapters

553790
debian	mint
if you use a desktop with windows 7 a mobile phone running android a tablet running ios and a laptop running debian mint you would have mixed ecosystem one that would probably be a specialized case possibly a cross-platform developer

553792
disk	ram
i am thinking of buying 16 gb of ram because it might help windows 7 cache more stuff and i would browse stuff faster and maybe it would allow games to cache all data as i play and decrease disk reads

553822
google-chrome	firefox
it s already possible to do this in firefox since some extensions have been developed for this purpose but i haven t found any equivalent for google-chrome

553837
disk	ram
windows will use all ram that s not being used for something more important as a disk cache

553842
put	get
i am able to get on the internet and surf the web but when i put in the ip to get to the routers setting page i can only connect to the settings of pages the modem and neatgear

i believed this changed the permissions to all my folder on the directory

553862
ethernet	wireless
i am considering buying another airport express to hook into the ethernet of the modem and turn off the modem router s wireless completely

553863
chown	chmod
you may also be able to use cygwin to accomplish your goals using the chown and chmod commands from a cygwin bash shell

553887
ubuntu	linux
if you are doing exploit development or security research you may want to switch to an older version of ubuntu linux or to a specialized distro like dvl if you can find a copy

553923
disk	ram
windows is very cache happy and will expand the disk cache to use all the available free ram if there is no pressing need from applications up to the amount that your edition of windows can use

553934
mouse	keyboard
plugged the mouse keyboard into the usb 2.0 ports

553939
sudo	passwd
it is usually used to extend your sudo passwd timeout but can be used for determining whether you have any sudo privileges

or will i have to format install windows use the anytime upgrade key to upgrade to professional and then do the restore when i have the extra features from the professional versioning in order to restore from the image on the nas drive

553986
folder	directory
the goal here is to grant access to their home folder only and lock them out of the parent directory shared environment

554034
ubuntu	linux
use gparted within ubuntu to shrink your linux partition so that you have unallocated space available for a new windows partition

554037

you ll probably have to pay for an encoder or decoder though

554061
sudo	passwd
now that i try to execute any command that requires the sudo stuff it asks me for a password...this is weird because i didn t specify any passwd when loading the image into virtual box...is there a way to restore reinitialize this passwd i need it very bad for my homework thanks guys

what do i need to do to complete this connection and to use the linux ruby interpreter from my virtualized ubuntu development server installation

554137

in the vast majority of applications you ll hit limits associated with the speed of your disk ram capacity or graphics processor prior to hitting the limits of your processor

554140
macbook	bootcamp
i have a macbook with windows installed in bootcamp

554191
https	tls1.2	ssl	tls1.2	ssl	https
don t use websites that use http - you must use https which uses ssl and ideally check that it is using at least tls1.0 tls1.2 would be the best

554191
tunnel	vpn
so you should really use a vpn for anything sensitive or valuable so you have an encrypted tunnel to an endpoint not attackable at your location

554197
filesystems	ntfs
can i get the ntfs filesystems performant by tweaking the allocation blocks or using some trick diskpart maybe

554219

554291

i need to know if there is a way to obtain this information via command line on a system running linux ubuntu 12.04 lts

554297
macports	homebrew
homebrew is a popular alternative to the above-suggested macports

554297
macports	homebrew
i haven t used macports but my impression from all the forum posts about the two is that homebrew is easier to use

554303
dpkg	apt
that would be fink which uses apt and dpkg

554308
folder	directory
there is a folder in my home directory that is called public_ftp but the contents of this foder does not appear at my browser when i visit ftp ftp.mysite.com

554319
folder	directory
just the current directory folder

554320

554458
mouse	keyboard
when the computer starts the keyboard and mouse are both completely functional pre-windows but by the time i make it to the welcome screen one or both devices are disabled

554458
mouse	keyboard
because i am unable to operate the keyboard or mouse within windows i am unable to resolve the problem directly

554458
mouse	keyboard
changed the ports used for the mouse and keyboard

554458
mouse	keyboard
under the system startup repair utility where the keyboard and mouse both work tried to revert to a prior restore point

554476
sudo	passwd
is there a command to de-elevate the user from sudo permissions after i execute a command such as sudo pmset sleep 0 so that when i try to execute another sudo command it asks for my passwd again

554476
sudo	passwd
currently after one sudo command it will execute any others without asking for my passwd

554482
sudo	passwd
it invalidates the sudo timestamp effectively revoking your sudo permissions so that you will be prompted for a passwd again next time you use sudo

554489
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
it s clear that some systemd daemons is listening for something since itunes gets launchd and can interpret the play pause next prev controls just fine.

554501
ethernet	wireless
that will take an ethernet or wifi connection and share it over wireless

554506
sudo	passwd
setting it to 0 means that sudo will prompt for a passwd every time it is run

554506
sudoers	visudo
run sudo visudo this will open a vim session allowing you to edit etc sudoers

554506
sudo	passwd
now sudo will always ask for a passwd even if you have just given it one

554541

or start over to add another share by checking the checkbox before clicking the button

554602

if you re a unix geek and have full backups you can delete disable and remove unused and unwanted systemd services and daemons from os x whichever version you re using

554602
unix	bsd
if you have no os particularly linux bsd or unix experience you might not want to bother too tweaking much

there is no client-server separation like in emacs so if remote file system access is out of the question you have to launch vim on the remote system

554845

554928
mouse	keyboard
alternatively if you have configured remote desktop then you can just boot the laptop and rdp to it using a different computer and its keyboard and mouse

554966
udp	tcp
if you are blocking it at the transport layer tcp udp so that port 80 is blocked then you have already prevented all traffic from going out on port 80 so you can t then take that back and make it less restrictive with a whitelist at the same time

554997
windows	winpe
update instead of trying to boot into winpe by running litetouch.vbs from the windows shell try booting directly to the cd

554997
windows	winpe
also you may have better luck segregating your winpe drivers from your windows 7 drivers like suggested above

555004

i run trojan cleans from time to time no trojans or virus found so far and i have windows 7 s standard firewall installed and several well-known and third-party anti-virus anti-trojan software running and my adiminstor s password is very long so althrough it is not safe from being hacked but the computer is not the easiest target either

555145
ubuntu	debian
if you re migrating from ubuntu and used to using the dpkg package management system apt-get etc. then i suggest giving debian testing a look

i have dell xps 15z windows 7 home premium 64 bit os with 4gb ram intel i5 processors 2.5 ghz and 1gb nvidia graphics.by default it uses 4 cpu however my system is slow in booting up and seems lazy doing simple things like opening programs and files i mean the response is slow

555204
titlebar	window
my guess is you have quickedit mode turned on right-click the command prompt windows s titlebar and select properties and you are clicking inside the window with your mouse thus selecting text by mistake and causing the program to pause

555205

that means everything your kids xbox playstation wii ds ipad and even their iphone

redhat	fedora	centos	linux
the userspace of centos redhat enterprise linux of the 6.x series is based on fedora 12 from late 2009 early 2010

555353
ubuntu	centos
so there s roughly 24 to 30 months of development work between centos 6.x and ubuntu 12.x

555353
clang	llvm	ubuntu	centos
if anything in glibc or libstdc++ especially has changed notably since then clang or anything based on llvm won t work if it was compiled for ubuntu 12.04 and run on centos 6.x

555353
clang	llvm
what you should do instead is either compile llvm and clang yourself on centos 6.3 or look for a repository that ships clang binaries for centos like elrepo

555435
sudo	passwd
sudo to root giving your own passwd when prompted sudo su

555440
stdout	stderr
if these are commands that can be started from the command line then you could do this with any good unix shell starting them as background activities using the operator piping both stdout and stderr through tee to write them into a log and display them

555451
move	drag
drag the text to move the text block

555451
move	drag
if you use the pointer tool to drag the text the shape will also move even if the text is no longer on the shape

555485

556034
mouse	keyboard
i need a service started and would like to disconnect keyboard mouse and monitor and have this service start just by turning on the computer

556058
wan	lan
you ll need to disable ics and bridge your lan and wan adapters

556058
subnet	packets
a bridge remedies this problem by simply creating a logical network segment between two adapters and forwarding all packets as if they were on the same subnet

556076
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i believe imagemagick is in centos and graphicsmagick a fork from the above is in epel

556134
folder	directory
a home directory is a folder that contains all the documents and settings for an individual user on a multi-user operating system

556145
arp	dhcp
the easiest way is to probably resolve the mac address into an ip address using dhcp to statically assign dynamic ip s is one way of doing this longer term if its a one off looking at your routers arp table or equivalent web page could do you

556160
folder	directory
if you are using a pre-vista windows the example above may not work unless you have a documents folder in your home directory

556212
ubuntu	debian
the nice thing with debian and remastersys is you can backup and restore on a command line install the ubuntu build needs some flavour of gui since it uses ubiquity .the bad thing is you need some extra packages - squashfs-modules and either aufs-modules or unionfs-modules and trying to run remastersys without them results in very bad things happening

556256
octal	decimal
the octal base-8 number in decimal is 198

556262
filesystems	ntfs
because the data drive was ntfs to be compatible with both windows and linux any files that became fragmented by the ntfs filesystems are now incomplete or corrupted by the recovery process

xmodem	zmodem	kermit	zmodem	kermit	xmodem
i ve never used a wyse50 terminal but was around in the bbs days prior to the wide use of the internet and the standard way to do what you are trying to do would be to install a program like zmodem on the server alternatives include xmodem kermit bimodem among others but zmodem is where i would start because it was simple and ubiquitous and ensure the terminal emulator had support for it then issue a command to send the program with xmodem and it would be capured to your system

556387
vmware	bootcamp
if you re using bootcamp and vmware fusion

556387
vmware	bootcamp
if vmware tools loads while running in a vm it will disable hibernation since vmware has its own suspend system making hibernation redundant. but if vmware tools loads outside of a vm you use bootcamp to boot into windows instead it will re-enable hibernation if its disabled

when attempting to listen on certain tcp or udp ports i get weird error messages regarding permissions or generic messages depending on the program used to bind

556759
udp	tcp
both ranges are exactly 1976 ports long. both tcp and udp are affected on the same ports

556773
config	ini
hard to understand exactly what you re doing but your input file fits the format of a config file like windows ini or unix conf

556773

try config simple or config ini from cpan

556779
utorrent	vuze
the external application is your bittorrent client vuze utorrent transmission etc. which is probably not configured to use tor

it would be possible to do a physical to virtual conversion of a running system and then you could mount it using a hypervisor such as vmware esx vsphere or microsoft s hyper-v

556796
mouse	keyboard
first it was the mouse and keyboard but i unplugged the mouse and then plugged it back in...now the mouse is working but they keyboard isn t

556822
mouse	keyboard
this may at least get you into bios where you can ensure that legacey support for keyboard and mouse are enabled

556822
mouse	keyboard
then hook up ps 2 keyboard and mouse boot up and see if they work

556864
mouse	keyboard
i also noticed that it seems to take a long time for my keyboard and mouse drivers to load now

556876
jobs	cron
i was messing around with creating cron jobs and somehow i wound up deleting crontab out of usr bin

556877
switching	screens
one issue that i m struggling with is a feature that many likely prefer in a multi monitor environment switching between workspaces in one screens does not switching workspaces in other screens

556877
switching	screens
then when switching to another workspace both screens were updated with applications relevant to the target workspace

556877
switching	screens
i can understand maintaining independent screens with 3+ monitors but in my setup i find myself switching workspaces much more in the primary monitor than the laptop which has very much become a secondary and somewhat limited option as i have to ctr + mod + j over to the laptop then mod + left right arrow to wherever the application is that corresponds with application s on the primary monitor

556922
hide	show
taskbar eliminator is a program that will completely hide the taskbar when it is first run and then let you show or hide it at any time by pressing alt + t as long as it remains running

556922
titlebar	window
you can edit the openbox rc.xml located in etc xdg openbox if you want to but as it is configured right now it will work just fine for our purposes because you can right-click the desktop area in openbox to get to a menu from which to launch applications and you can right click the titlebar of an application in openbox to remove the window decoration which if done after resizing the window gives you the desired faux-fullscreen effect

556929
hash	md5
for practical purposes zero unless the user actively tries to create two files that have the same hash which is possible with md5

556949
udp	tcp
it is simpler to set up just udp port 1194 or whatever you choose so it works really well with nat - it can even be configured to work over tcp and its more secure

556979
switching	screens
i am using a lenovo yoga 13 with windows 8 on it and right now if i use the desktop i don t know whether it is due to the trackpad s sensitivity and its feature or is it win 8 doing it the screens often switching to skype or other win 8 app which is a win 8 app not a desktop app

556980
mouse	trackpad
i solved it in fact using the solution of going to the control panel choose mouse settings and the last tab can let me fine tune the synaptics trackpad s settings

556996
ubuntu	linux
it is definitely possible to do full disk encryption with 2 partitions under linux and i know that it can be done with ubuntu

557007
mouse	keyboard
another option is a kvm switch shares monitor keyboard and mouse

557042
move	drag

later i realized that the keyboard and mouse does not function properly at the time i start my laptop or this problem emerges after i use it for a while 4 5 minutes

557233

557373
mouse	keyboard
lock host keyboard and mouse

557384

vmware	virtualbox
if you need the tool run it inside a virtual machine virtualbox vmware with a windows xp for example

557477
disk	ram
every time you do that virtualbox will generate a new vm name and allow you to change the basic parameters cpu ram size attached disk etc.

557519
mouse	keyboard
as the gpu graphical processing unit overheats it slows itself down and this can appear to make the laptop start to respond very slowly a slow to respond mouse or a slow to respond keyboard no matter if its the laptops own keyboard or mouse or external ones

557519
mouse	keyboard
if you now get longer use of the mouse and keyboard turn off for 15 mins and try again before timing that points towards the gpu overheating although this test may not make much difference if the overheating is severe

557635

i currently have it setup so that vnet0 is set to use just the wireless card and vnet1 bridged with the ethernet

557890
ethernet	wireless
the issue is all the guests view both adapters as an ethernet connection instead of the wireless bridge with the wireless card as a wireless adapter

557902

folder	directory
most mail servers store emails either in mail folder or mail directory

558090
folder	dir	folder	directory
mail dir means each folder is actually a directory with each mail message represented

558090
folder	directory
you are correct in saying if you get this mail file which actually means mail folder or mail directory you can write a script to import it into your database

558090
folder	directory
as far as identifying the mail directory folder this is not something for you to do its something for the postmaster at your domain to advise you as they could be anywhere

558090
folder	dir
an alternative to getting the mail folder dir would be to instruct the server to provide it to you

558094
pop-up	dialog
choose from menu tools - compatibility view settings and in the pop-up dialog input your site

558098

both installs were done on single attached disk with 4 gb of ram 1 module attached to the mobo

558907

i expected to have to call microsoft to re-register the windows install for the new hardware since i had to do that last time i upgrade w the same windows versioning

558986
move	drag	folder	directory
the destination folder should still be visible in the directory tree so you can just drag the folder you want to move and drop it into the destination folder

558990
ethernet	wireless
assigning a wireless adaptor to the guest from networking settings wouldn t work since this will be virtualised as an ethernet card

558999

basically what you do is plug the hdmi end of the stick into the tv the tv doesn t even have to be smart at all connect your peripherals to the stick using a usb on the go cable fed into a usb hub or just use bluetooth peripherals connect the stick to the wifi network and you have a full fledged operating system usually based on android or desktop linux such as ubuntu

559027
tunnel	vpn
i got gateway authentication error after i tried to connect to vpn it also says that tunnel disabled can it be the reason why i am not able to connect

a friend not technical has a linux server running centos which will no longer boot

559145
google-chrome	firefox
i would hazard a guess that the op is running dual video card in a non sli crossfire setup and that those spikes are your gpu accelerated applications google-chrome firefox ie9-ie10 doing something

559148
disk	ram
raw disk editing and modifying of main memory ram handles files of

559176

559265
mouse	keyboard
i use a program called synergy which is essentially a virtual network keyboard mouse

559265
mouse	keyboard
one computer acts as the server and the other client pcs can then use the keyboard and mouse

559266
mouse	keyboard
the only way around it is to use a normal keyboard and mouse and then give full access permission to the program in question

559277
folder	directory
create a new folder named applications in your home directory

559278

559663
cpu	processors
processors intel r core tm i5 cpu m 520 2.40 ghz 2.40 ghz

559676
mp3	ogg
the only way to determine this is for you to try readily available codecs like mp3 aac ogg

559678
rpm	yum
if the kernel was installed before check with rpm -q kernel it might still be around by default yum keeps 3 versions so you can still boot into it

559680
pop-up	dialog
when i do this i get the vertical error bars that i showed above and also horizontal error bars.â if you get them too click on one of them right-click and select â œformat error barsâ from the pop-up menu.â a â œformat error barsâ dialog box will appear but this time it will be for the horizontal error bars.â set the â œerror amountâ to a â œfixed valueâ of â œ0â .â click â œcloseâ

check your computer s system information to see whether you need an x86 32-bit or x64 64bit version of the program and then contact the software publisher.

559705
x86	64bit
if you don t have access to xp mode or you tried it and it did not work another thing to try is the dosbox x86 emulator i have used it in the past to make some old games work from what i have read online it will let you run 16 bit programs on 64bit windows

filesystems	ntfs
mft is part of the ntfs the filesystems

559895
versioning	upgrade
yours is a 64-bit processor look under instruction set so your machine is a 64 bit machine but you are running a 32-bit versioning of windows i would upgrade to 64 bit as it will not only run faster but recognize more than 3.5 gigs of ram

559913
vmware	virtualbox
your virtual machine s ethernet adapter should be bridging with the hardware one aka bridged networking option usually in vmware or virtualbox

559913
vmware	virtualbox
if you use nat on your host share host s ip in vmware or virtualbox it is equivalent to running a simple router on the host machine which will only allow access from the virtual machine to the outside but not the other way around

559914
puts	gets
the virtualization software puts the physical network card in promiscuous mode so it gets all traffic sent to the host

ffmpeg	libav
the packages that come with ubuntu are always outdated and â depending on your ubuntu version â not even the real ffmpeg but the libav fork which is fine to use but one should know the difference

560006

you need to rip the cd properly using an app such as exact audio copy to a format such as wav flac or mp3 which can then be played in your player of choice

560036
directx	gdi
it was originally designed for and works best with directx but it seems opengl another graphics library similar to directx and gdi general windows programs often use this support has been added

560052
folder	dir
some of these folder may get deleted and new folder also get added so just dumping a dir command to a spreadsheet and sorting the result won t help - the spreadsheet would have to be updated every time a folder is added or removed

560065
ethernet	wireless
sometimes i connect via an ethernet cable and also pick-up the wireless signal for an iphone and ipad

560091
ethernet	wireless
since it is not clear how your existing setup was i m making an assumption based on the most common setup that could exist where your cable modem was not acting as a router your linksys router was the primary router providing wired and wireless access and you had a netgear switch connected to the linksys router to get extra ethernet ports for your network

560130
cpu	processors
both the processors and the memory are listed on the motherboard s cpu and memory support list

560281
kate	kde
you can try for example ted notepad my favorite neat but lots of features programmer s notepad both for windows or kate linux kde

560283
cpu	processors
some hardware can accept different clock settings so if the front side bus is stable to run at 166mhz the cpu can either be run at 166x9 1.5ghz giving a combined boost to memory access and processors speed or if the cpu is unstable at this speed the multiplier can be lowered to 7.5 giving a cpu speed of 1.25ghz but allowing the increased fsb for faster memory access

560300
ssd	sata
my question is that since trim will be disabled in this machine can i periodically remove the ssd and move it to another machine with a sata controller to run cleanup operations to free up unused data blocks from there

ubuntu	linux
i have a slightly older desktop running ubuntu linux with an older nvidia geforce 9-series graphics card with only dvi and vga output

560416
dns	spf
however if none of those are the case then most likely this is because your machine s ip address is not listed in your dns spf record

560416
dns	spf
the spf record is a txt record added to your domain dns

560416
dns	spf
if you do have control of your dns then i suggest adding your host to your spf record

560420
folder	directory
this means the data must be in a hidden folder in the root directory of the external hard drive

wan	lan
disconnect the internet wan port -- this router will be connected only to your lan

560747
cpu	processors
then we should expect that when the cpu does not determine that turbo boost is required under a modest load the processors with the higher clock speed will get more work done faster with the same amount of energy

560772
ubuntu	linux
grab a linux livecd like ubuntu boot up into that environment and plug the drive in

560818
multiplying	add
multiplying the latency of the number of round trips and add in the transfer time of the files to come up with some number that should be around 25 seconds

560818
ftp	smb
solution reduce latency or use a newer version of the smb protocol as supported by newer versions of windows server which have fewer app turns and thus higher performance over a wan or use something like ftp which has very low chattiness but still high overhead when accessing lots of files or just operate on the server directly and only transfer data as needed in bulk zip files to the remote server

webkit	gecko
aside from gecko khtml trident and webkit there is presto amaya and links - although they are far from being as widely used as the previously mentioned rendering engines

562507
wan	lan
what i think i understood from your description is that you have a notebook computer with 2 network interfaces wifi and wired ethernet which you would like to use simultaneously to access internal lan and external wan resources

562507
wan	lan	wan	subnet
the easiest configuration would be setting the wifi wan interface as your default interface and then adding static route to your lan subnet via wired ethernet interface

562515

ubuntu has a release cycle that is at least twice as fast as debian

562954

ubuntu is not however necessarily the best software if your goal is to get the latest updates for absolutely everything you install in linux

562966
google-chrome	firefox
every time i try to login to gmail with my username and my password over a browser firefox google-chrome internet explorer i cannot login

562974
rsa	dsa
use rsa dsa keys and or chrooted user to limit exposure to your system if required

562974
tunnel	vpn
if you need more than that you could set up a tunnel using a tun device which gives you something closer to a vpn using just ssh

562977
mouse	keyboard
in terminal is there a way for me to find all the input devices eg keyboard and mouse

562994
wan	lan
the important bit is to connect the new router on the lan side not the wan side and ignore the wan side on the new router.

562995
debian	linux
i now have ssh daemon on a remote server and ssh client my pc both running debian linux

563007
post	put
if you are buying multiple disks - and ignoring backup concerns as per your post it might make sense to put swap and os on one disk and data on another but i would still be heavily inclined to configure them in a raid0 or jbod for maximum performance for as it will make very little difference in performance if any

563018
windows	wow64
for 32-bit applications such as bash.exe from cygwin which runs via wow64 subsystem on windows x64 there are two redirections in the filesystem

563174
disk	ram
i installed ubuntu server edition 12.10 on a server with 16 gb ram and 500gb hard disk

563181

they can do fine when transferring data between lan ports but when it comes to wan their performance can be very sub-par

563201
google-chrome	firefox
tried with different browsers - google-chrome firefox

563233
wan	lan
most home routers actually only have 2 real interfaces the wan interface which connects to the isp and the lan ports which act like a 4 port switch

563253
ubuntu	linux
this prob is more or less solved in the newer versions of the linux distros like fedora 18 and ubuntu 12 since it warns that the hiberfile exits and should be deleted or the drive should be mounted in read-only mode

563265
folder	directory
i ve created the directory in the sites folder and edited the etc apache2 extra httpd-vhosts.conf file and the private etc hosts file

when your os is running out of memory it will start to move some programs from ram to a disk space called pagefile

563312
filesystems	ntfs
it doesn t matter if the operating system supports ntfs as it s filesystems you ll have to partition your external hard drive in order to install any operating system in it

563312
filesystems	ntfs
once you partitioned your hard drive and installed the distro of your choice in it you can easily access your files on the ntfs partition by mounting it from within the operating system you just installed - you can use ext3 or any other standard gnu linux filesystems

563442
ubuntu	debian
if you are willing to use packages from debian s experimental repo i did notice that some gnome 3.6 packages are available there like gnome-shell but keep in mind that these packages are not guaranteed to work at all and may break your system the same goes for installing most ubuntu ppas

563477
sudoers	passwd
i m trying to edit etc sudoers so that i can execute a bash script with a root passwd

i d really like to use homebrew to install ruby versions and rbenv to manage them

563500
pptp	nat
i ve found some posts that claimed the vmware nat doesn t support this others that claimed it does but you need a router that supports it with pptp gre47 support and yet others that claim it works using a bridged connection instead of nat

563633
sudo	passwd
i don t know much about osx but as it s your own machine i m assuming you have sudo permissions in which case emacs will prompt you for your passwd and should then write the file

563635
ubuntu	mint
installing freenx on ubuntu also applies to mint

563644
pptp	nat
the issue seems to be with the vmware nat implementation which apparently doesn t support pptp passthrough properly and seems to have issues when handling multiple vpn connections even when they are directed to a different vpn server

563644
pptp	nat
this should not be the case as even with pptp passthrough that erroneously handles connectids nat should work fine due to the different destination addresses

563644
pptp	nat
a solution that probably always works even when several guest systems connect to the same vpn server would be to use the vmware bridged network adapter instead of the nat one and have a router that properly supports pptp passthrough

563713

alternatively if you have a multi-core processors you may want to consider giving eclipse core affinity

when used with a quality adjustable keyboard and mouse tray and having it all setup properly it can eliminate and more-so prevent most related strain injuries

563784
switching	screens
it will check if you re currently in a screens session and if so it will use the designated vim window and switching to it or make the current window the designated vim window if none exist otherwise it will fallback to using vim normally

unix	bsd
since tar is such an old file format and newer file formats exist today why is tar whether encapsulated in gzip bzip2 or even the new xz still so widely used today on gnu linux android bsd and other such unix operating systems for file transfers program source and binary downloads and sometimes even as a package manager format

565895
tar	gunzip
many tools are distributed in source or binary form as .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 because it is a lowest common denominator file format much like most windows users have access to .zip or .rar decompressors most linux installations even the most basic will have access to at least tar and gunzip no matter how old or pared down

565895
rar	zip	rar	gzip
new projects targeting audiences running modern distributions may very well distribute in a more modern format such as .tar.xz using the xz lzma compression format which compresses better than gzip or bzip2 or .7z which is similar to the zip or rar file formats in that it both compresses and specifies a layout for encapsulating multiple files into a single file

so in your case i think the solution would be configure two network interfaces the default eth0 and eth0 1 with a different valid ip from your lan for your server then configure routes so that by default all traffic go to the vpn and traffic originating from the secondary interface stays off the vpn

centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
there are plenty light linux s you can use like dsl centos even an updated version of ubuntu will work

567552
cpu	processors
anything from the tcase and below will be the expected temperature of the processors in normal use anything that doesn t stress out the processors watching movies burning cds browsing the internet creating documents etc. when the processors is stressed out meaning that you are running heavy processors applications that take control of the cpu or uses it at 100 the temperature will go beyond the tcase

567562
hide	show
i have a great batch toggle that will show hidden files when run then hide hidden files when run again

if the user opens a directory in the open dialog does this give the sandboxed application access to all of the contents of the folder even if the specific user may not have permission to access some of them

567627
wav	ogg
i am converting an audio cd to ogg format by ripping it to wav using cdparanoia and encoding it as ogg using oggenc

567627
wav	ogg
however if i mux the ogg file instead of the wav file the chapters start slightly too late that is vlc starts each chapter about 0.5-1.5 seconds into the track

567627
wav	ogg
i am using version 4.9.1 ich will of mkvmerge to mux from wav ogg to mka and i am using version 2.0.3 twoflower of vlc to play the files

567656
google-chrome	firefox
which works to stream the test stream though slowly it has to stop every couple of seconds to catch up in google-chrome fails after the same period in firefox - only gets 13 fps

567659
ffmpeg	libvpx
for a list of options run ffmpeg -h full and look at the libvpx section

567709
rpm	yum
i want to install php through yum and i can t install php through rpm

567719
versioning	upgrade
does anyone familiar with the roadmap know if the updater is going to support the upgrade or if the major versioning change is out-of-scope of that project

567722
google-chrome	firefox
you set up google-chrome firefox to browse the internet through it via socks5 instead of using the workplace proxy

567759
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
both nic s work fine under either ubuntu or linux mint as from what i understand linux uses a generic ethernet driver

567761
disk	ram
if you had a ram disk and two processes waiting to bzip some data on that ram disk then the situation would be quite different

567786
min	max
a quick way to accomplish this is to manually set your y axis min and max values based upon your data assuming 0-100

567799
google-chrome	firefox
using google-chrome firefox or ie i get the this webpage is not available error

567799

567839
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
my collection is a mix of ogg mp3 flac files and by far the majority of the non-recognized albums art are in the ogg files though not all followed by flac and mp3s don t seem to be particularly problematic

567850
udp	tcp
you should be experiencing slowdown and not file corruption though as both tcp and udp have checksums to throw out bad packets

567856
cpu	processors
all of the 1155 pin processors i can find only seem to support a maximum of 32gb of memory at the cpu level so i don t think this is possible

567877
folder	directory
as soon as the target directory contains symlinks the copying operation can escape the directory boundaries and more files and folder than intended go over board

567924
ffmpeg	libav
the behavior you re seeing doesn t really make sense but given that you re using the broken and fake ffmpeg that s actually from libav and not the real deal it s probably a bug that has long been fixed

567929
vbscript	jscript
you can use vbscript or jscript to get what you want

567934

first define the width height and aspect ratio of your output

567978
filesystems	ntfs
i am using windows 7 pro x64 and the filesystems is ntfs

568011
wan	lan
if you can communicate with lan devices default gateway with no issues then itâ s wan related simply try pinging external targets or running tracerts on them

568023
udp	tcp
tcp udp and ip checksum calculation can be offloaded to the nic

568036
ssd	sata
ssd is going to be faster sata is still faster than usb 3 especially when you look at real world performance

568060
cpu	processors
cpu b on the other hand could have less cores or even one theoretically and be very efficient specifically for the type of process being done and be faster than the faster processors

568060
cpu	processors
if cpu a did not support certain instruction sets it might only use 30 of its overall power but again a more efficient processors that handles the instruction sets might be faster at this task despite being a slower processors

568060
disk	ram
cpu b could be better at shuttling data around from disk ssd perhaps and ram thus it spiked to 80 partially because it could load enough data to cache fast enough to fill up while cpu a was on a 4 200 rpm laptop drive attached and burned each segment of data faster but could not keep enough data in cache to keep up

568065
umask	mount
all directories have --- --- rwx 0007 permission after ftp mount with umask 0770

568068
disk	ram
the os must be loaded from disk to ram and cpu that really makes a difference and that is why i only use 7 200rpm or faster drives in my desktops and laptops or ssd

568088
ssd	sata
the specs tell me it comes with sata 5400 rpm and ssd solid state drive not on the specs page but advertised never-the-less as 1tb hard drive + 24gb solid state drive

568097
subnet	packets
routers forward packets between subnet

568120
switching	screens
as long as i let 580gtx stick to display role and titan stick to cuda role they work fine however if i try to switching the cards for display role let titan to display through setting up in nvidia driver control panel then the screens stops refreshing and is basically frozen

568205
vmware	virtualbox	vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp	virtualbox	parallels	virtualbox	bootcamp
instead of bootcamp you could virtualize windows xp with virtualbox parallels or vmware fusion

568205
switching	screens
your father could run windows xp full screens and os x apps side by side and easily switching between them

568208
mouse	keyboard
use mouse and keyboard commands to access the printer menu or use p while opening and set up the things you want

568208

default unix or bsd columns

568286
logmein	hamachi
i have logmein hamachi vpn

568333
ubuntu	linux
or using my linux ubuntu machine by using rm -rf it also returned me that the paths and filenames are too long

568354
folder	directory
nevertheless to be on the safe side i would recommend only creating junctions for a few big sub directory instead of the entire program files folder

568361
opera	google-chrome
you can also try to install opera or google-chrome to see if the same problems occur

568407
centos	linux
i am new to linux and i have installed java and tomcat6 on centos 5.6 using yum

568465

set up the dependencies with macports or other package managers such as homebrew

568495
post	get
i ve read some years-old post that say you should tweak some options in windows to get the best performance

subshell	ifs
the parentheses execute everything in a subshell so changing the variables ifs and substring won t have any effect outside the subshell

568546
ssd	sata

568550
folder	directory
the only options for default path are or which doesn t accomplish the task as my movies folder is not in the source directory

568559
filesystems	btrfs
by using a filesystems that does on-the-fly data hashing and validation such as zfs or btrfs do note that although great advances have been made btrfs is not considered ready for production use at this time you can be reasonably sure that if the data can be read off the disk without the operating system erroring out then the data read was written to disk in the way intended by the filesystems

568559
hash	md5
scaling those figures up 100-fold you d get the md5 hash of a 15 tb collection in about three days time on that same hardware

568567
stdout	stderr
skew the wchar count with output to stdout stderr etc. why not just look directly at the linux s count of wchar

568587

local guy still can t get it to post

568601
ssl	https
https does exactly the same thing except on port 443 â and it wraps the entire tcp session everything you see in the quoted bit above plus the response into an ssl encrypted session â so the isp does not see any of the traffic but they may be able to infer something based on the size of the site and the dns lookup to resolve www.sitename.com to an ip address in the first instance

568633
cpu	hyperthreading
normally in a hyperthreading cpu the on-core cache is shared between the two threads that the core supports

568633
cpu	hyperthreading
the main gain for core parking is that when the system is not heavily multi-tasking the hyperthreading cores can be parked this allows the cpu to reallocate the entire cache on each core to 1 thread instead of 2

568656
filesystems	ntfs
it seems like the laptop needs to be turned off for several hours before the ntfs filesystems gets damaged

568680
filesystems	fat
tool that lets users arrange files according to their wishes and sorts the fat filesystems low-level style

568693
disk	ram
i have a few xen guests that are very similar same arch same os debian usually the differences are in ram and disk space

568709
daemons	systemd
in fact the old rc.d init systemd is likely far easier to audit given that it is written in shell script edit except for the init daemons itself written in c and is much shorter

568709
sysv	systemd
like sysv init the old arch linux init systemd which really is built on top of sysv systemd etc

568709
redhat	fedora
those are debianisms fedora redhat centos whateverisms etc

568709
sysv	systemd
systemctl is just an interface to the systemd process like telinit for sysv so i also suggest removing that

568709
sysv	systemd
arch linux did try to hide the sysv underpinnings with its homegrown bsd-like init systemd though so i d leave that

568709
sysv	systemd
in the end something like why is systemd replacing sysv bsd init

568770
min	max
you can set min max download size and can set it to perform the test for you every 5 minutes if you wish or more reasonable 1-2 hours

you have a notebook with gentoo installed and you run virtualbox with ubuntu server as guest

568829
administration	activation
these functions typically include wireless activation setup and administration

568842

ubuntu	debian
it looks like bugzilla is being dropped from debian and ubuntu

569065
sudoers	passwd
in etc sudoers you can set the directive default rootpw which will prompt for a root second passwd

569065
sudo	passwd
my question is how can i have the user enter a 2nd different passwd to access the root account or to sudo

569067
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
then set the default rootpw directive in etc sudoers and you ll have what you re looking for root won t be able to log in by any means but will have a passwd set which sudo will require sudoers to provide before letting them sudo anything

mouse	keyboard
when you can get on your machine and the mouse works as expected update your drivers or even roll them back for the keyboard mouse

569319
mouse	keyboard
borrow another keyboard mouse and see if the problem persists

569319
mouse	keyboard
use different usb ports for keyboard and mouse assuming they re both usb

569336
ethernet	wireless
it gives you the possibility to access usb devices over 802.11n wireless and a 10 100 1000base ethernet

569349
wan	lan
the firmware can also make the wan port another lan port so you don t loose one

569371
post	get
formatting the drive will get rid of everything some people prefer exfat over ntfs if you re going to make backups of your entire computer see this post for how i recommend you do it

569394
switching	screens
i don t want switching screens when my mouse moves to the sides

569414
dropbox	skydrive
i know we can use skydrive or dropbox but i think these apps has below basic limitations which will not solve mapping for my own folders to get sync

569432
stdout	stderr
since i m redirecting stderr into stdout then filtering stdout to only give me desired output which doesn t include password how is the password prompt being presented to me

569439
ubuntu	linux
my goal is run ubuntu server vms or possibly another smaller linux distribution with exception of possibly 1 windows server instance

569439
post	get
i am going to continue to press to get a good solution for my home and once i have it i am going to post my results

569439
post	get
hopefully the next person struggling to get started with hypervisors will find this post and know how to approach solving this problem

569446
centos	linux
if you aren t really going to run windows oses then i would use a linux based hypervisor as hyperv will run linux oses but to get good networking support you would need to run rhel or centos just fyi

569466
folder	directory
i ve got a directory in my home folder in which i place command-line software cmd_software

569469

569552
jobs	cron
i m using to view all cron jobs created by all cpanel users

569604
disk	ram
you won t experience data loss in normal use but if the system ever goes down uncleanly the battery runs out disk buffers don t get flushed before a suspend to ram that doesn t recover cleanly c. between some data hitting a write buffer and that data being written out to disk the lack of a journal will result in at least the inability to recover that data and at worst a completely broken filesystem

569616
post	put
as one post suggested when i put the computer to sleep the high usage goes away again

569636
folder	directory
then i want to remove any duplicate folder names and in a last step only grab the root directory

569639
pop-up	dialog
seems every 5 seconds or so the trying to reconnect dialog pop-up it reconnects it works for a few seconds then freezes again until the trying to reconnect dialog appears again

569662
ethernet	wireless
my goal is to be able to extend and access the network wirlessly i would prefer to keep the same password and ssid of the existing wireless and use the existing ethernet cable that is on the third floor so nothing too fancy i would also prefer not to mess with other firmware if possible

569671
stdout	stderr
note that if you want to redirect stderr to stdout and override noclobber neither nor will work

569685
google-chrome	firefox
i have firefox and google-chrome installed on my os as normal but i would like to have a completely private browser installed on my truecrypt partition--another copy of one of the two preferably google-chrome but either is fine installed completely independently on the partition

569704
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome preferably but i might as well switch to another browser at times if there would be a solution that is only possible within mozilla firefox

569715
wan	lan
a pc running linux with 3 network cards does this nicely - one nic is the wan the other nic is connected to your lan hosts and the third your wireless router is plugged into

569716
disk	ram
usually this is a very brief wake up but the process of hibernation requires ram and other state information to be written to disk which can take a while depending on ram size

569723
switching	screens
most of the times i want both screens to show the same output but i want to be able to switching the image on the hdmi-screen to a looping video clip smoothly and via a hotkey while not changing the image on the dvi-monitor

569729
ubuntu	linux
linux software raid usually with dmraid or mdadm is usually better than the onboard intel controller anyway i cannot remember which one ubuntu uses by default off the top of my head

569732
put	get
this is where it get s annoying i put the gigabyte gv-n680oc-4gd into an asrock mother board where the gigabyte gv-n670oc-2gd came from and it worked fine

569737
wan	lan	wan	subnet
lan setup shows ip address as 10.0.0.1 not sure what this means - unable to change to value in the 2wire range without getting wan subnet conflict error

569741
tunnel	vpn
if your workplace is using split-tunneling you will only send traffic to internal work addresses through the vpn tunnel

569750
ssl	https
there are many windows builds of lynx available over the net but none of them support https so i was trying to build with ssl enabled among other things

569766
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
but if you want to upgrade your php installation you might simply call the one-line-installer from liip again which will install the new versioning in a new directory under usr local and link it against the usr local php5 -folder

569767
subnet	packets
if on lan b you request 192.168.1.2 one of the wireless clients trying to connect to a wired client it goes to lan b s router sees that it is a request for the 192.168.1.x subnet and does not forward the packets any further up the chain it could but it would not matter see the lower section of this answer

569767
wan	lan
depending on how your wireless router s firmware works you may be able to do it with two routers by just moving the connection of the wireless from it s lan port to its wan port

569767
wan	subnet
however you can only do this if the wireless router does not forward requests it can t resolve to the gateway for it s own subnet so in my previous example the wireless router must not check the wan port for 192.168.1.2 for the two router configuration

569767
wan	lan
in the 3 router y configuration it does not matter if the router forwards requests or not because on the y lan there are no 192.168.1.x computers only the two routers wan interfaces which are both 192.168.0.x

569768
mp3	wav
i ve been trying to convert a sequence of png files to a video with some sound mp3 or wav

mp3	wav
i tried copying audio encoding to various codecs from mp3 and wav with various bitrates etc.

569804
winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	wireshark	libpcap	wireshark
in particular see their page discussing monitor mode for native 802.11 drivers and their page about ndis packet filters which are not the same as for example capture filters in libpcap winpcap and applications such as tcpdump and wireshark that use libpcap winpcap

569807
ubuntu	debian
convert vmdk to physical disk image ubuntu debian

569807
ubuntu	debian
if you have access to a debian ubuntu system first use qemu-img as explained here to create a raw image

569819
rpm	yum
there is only one catch - if you installed some java not using official package manager dpkg apt-get rpm yum but simply extracted it update-alternatives will not show it

569826
filesystems	ntfs
i seem to remember having a long time ago mounted a vmware fusion shared folder inside the ntfs filesystems of the windows machine once so iis and sql server would read it as a local folder but it was actually being shared from os x

569841
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i m running xubuntu 12.10 ubuntu 12.10 and linux mint 14 in virtualbox 4.10 with windows 7 as the host system

569893
ati	nvidia
what if i buy a super-duper-computer with 2 or more top-grade nvidia ati gpu boards and will mostly above 80 of time use it for simple browsing office coding tasks will it consume a lot of power and produce huge amounts of heat or will it just downclock itself automatically

569897
ati	nvidia
most high end graphics cards have power management systems which both nvidia and ati offer that allow you to adjust voltage use by your gpu and so-on

569923
ati	nvidia
try this as nvidia never has made a decent driver uninstaller actually the reason i moved to ati over ten years ago... although some people feel the same about ati

569976
daemon	cron
a possible problem is that the cron daemon is started before an ip is assigned

570010
ubuntu	debian
i recommend using that and if you re not on debian or ubuntu just copy that script from debian and try it

570029
jobs	cron
if it is crucial that users cron jobs run at the times they specified you will have to take a look at using pam limits

570039
hex	binary
the problem is that i have to stare at each column of the character and determine its binary value and then figure out the hex value

570048
rar	zip
while you cannot beat the accessibility of zip windows mac os x can handle zip files within explorer finder the compression ratio of rar is much much better

570049
wan	lan
it s a fairly simple set up i have a static ip from the isp and a single pppoe wan interface and a single lan interface

570059
debian-based	ubuntu
on debian-based distros ubuntu there s mediainfo

570073
width	height
you cant have height and width attributes for tables and the meta attribute charset is redundant

570129
udp	tcp
also if you have openvpn configured for udp try tcp 443 udp may be blocked whereas 443 tcp may go undetected

570129
ssl	https
if they don t match then your location is using a transparent https ssl proxy and can actually see your https traffic

570189
filesystems	ntfs
if filesystems of your disk drive is ntfs 30gb file size shouldn t be a problem

570208
email	dkim
it sometimes happens that one of our servers is running perfectly alright but the dkim service is stopped it then makes postfix unable to send out email it can easily go undetected if we were not to check dkim service

570216
kde	gnome
install either gnome keyring or kde kwallet before installing adobe air

570224
debian	linux
what are the solutions to deactivating a gpu and using an igp on a linux system such as debian

570242

570242
ethernet	wireless
the internet on both the mac book bro and probook is working 100 fine the mac book on wireless and probook through ethernet

570253
vmware	esx
could this be caused by the virtualization software which i think is vmware esx

570277
google-chrome	firefox
default browser reverts from google-chrome to firefox

570306
virtualbox	parallels
i want to install windows on a vm created in virtual pc on my windows7 pc and be able to run it using parallels or virtualbox on my mac

570310
disk	ram
the machine now boots to the bios setup screen recognizes all the ram and the disk

570314
installation	upgrade
i have seen kiosk installation albeit running linux where the boot disk was actually an external cf later a ssd mounted on an ejectable bracket so that system upgrade could be performed by dhl ing a replacement boot disk to the customer who could do the upgrade itself we also had some theft problems due to the ease of removal of the disk which you might need to consider

570316
virtualbox	parallels
i am not sure about parallels but virtualbox supports virtualpc vhds natively

570335
folder	directory
i want to merge two folder in a particular way i guess these are called folder now i still think of them as directory but whatever

570349
pull	push
i am standing in the correct folder though and running git from console it works i can push pull and so on but gitk won t start as it say it is not any git repository here

570354
folder	dir
use variable name as home and variable value as userprofile to set the home dir in windows.by default your .ssh folder should be there

570390
ethernet	wireless
one is the loopback interface lo another should be the wireless interface maybe wlan0 and the one remaining is the ethernet interface

570402
vmware	virtualbox
i was able to get the scanner working on my windows 7 x64 using vmware vmware support for usb is better than virtualbox at the moment ie supports usb3 and allows overriding usb3 to usb2

570412

the two extenders see an ethernet connection and route video mouse keyboard signals through that and bob s your uncle

571941
mouse	keyboard
you could buy a wireless mouse and keyboard but sending the video to the display would be a bit tricky and involve either the buying of expensive equipment or setting up a wlan

versioning	upgrade
if you use mixed sources some mix of stable unstable testing experimental and or others you might want to tell apt about which one the desired package should be drawn from - if you try to upgrade a package that is already installed from another source the dependencies installed from that source might be incompatible with the new versioning

573666
dpkg	apt
if you are desperate you might want to try to download the package and then dpkg -i --force-depends mypackage.deb - but that is a last resort and it will likely break stuff if apt tells you there is a dependency problem it usually knows better than me.

another option is to use ext2 3 4 and a windows filesystems driver like ext2fsd on your windows boxes though if you might ever need to use the drive on a locked-down windows box at a library or place of work for instance where you can t install the ext filesystems driver you ll be just as stuck as those occasions where you can t read ntfs

for instance pressing ctrl + alt + numpad5 will position chrome or whatever s focused in the center of the screen at 66 width and 100 height which is my preferred browser size on a 24 monitor

577580
width	height
additional presses of the same keys cycle through different placements sizing one of which is 100 width 100 height but not maximized -- this would allow you to use your browser full screen if that s how you prefer but still have the tabs pushed down away from the top of the screen

a router with 192.168.3.1 subnet 255.255.254.0 will route 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.3.255 through its lan port all other will be forwarded to its wan gateway

582483
tunnel	vpn
it may be possible for the trainer to give you his credentials and you set up a tunnel - but whether this works is dependent on the companies setup - particularly it won t work if its tied down by ip address it may cause issues if both of you try and use the same vpn at the same time depending on how ip address allocation is done and it is conceivable that the vpn is monitored and logging in from 2 locations at once could set off alarms

google-chrome	firefox
it s increasingly becoming the case that many browser extensions and plugins require access to all my data in both google-chrome and firefox

582599
wan	lan
a you can perhaps eliminate the switch since you ll need the router to accept traffic and act as a gateway for the 29 which you ll configure on its lan interface and the mso shall have a static route to send the 29 to your router s wan interface which necessarily not be part of the 29

the folder in the programs directory only contains the files needed to run the application and none of my personal files and inside documents and settings i m unable to find what i need but i suspect that those files should be somewhere there

583938
afp	smb
seeing as you are all apple based i would however suggest you share your files folders using afp apple file protocol rather than smb

583938
cifs	smb
it s a proprietary protocol developed by apple - it s like their version of smb cifs and it generally works better with macs

583938
cifs	smb
however if you plan to add windows devices later you ll need to also share those directories using smb cifs

583950
sudo	passwd
also previous passwd is unknown so sudo passwd doesn work it requires me to have the old passwod

on very large drives it may be impossible to allocate the entire drive to a single partition this was a big problem with the old fat filesystems so you must use multiple partitions

ffmpeg or more likely the fork avconv if you re using debian or ubuntu - these instructions should apply equally to both though nobody knows how far apart they may drift in the future should be in the repositories of your distro

when guest systems with the guest additions installed are started using the graphical frontend the normal virtualbox application they will not be allowed to use screens resolutions greater than the host s screens size unless the user manually resizes them by dragging the window switching to full screens or seamless mode or sending a video mode hint using vboxmanage

get the folder short name via dir x then add that short name to the path

584881
dpkg	apt
the downside is that dpkg does not automatically fetch and install the dependencies that s what apt is for

584881
ftp	smb
this means you will need to maintain the repository on one of your debian machines and then transfer or sync it with its mirror on your windows machine which means messing with ftp or smb or rsync or whatever else

584960
chmod	sudoers
all this was solved by chmod 0777 on executable file that sym link was pointing at and no need for changing sudoers any more

584974
ubuntu	mint
the first time you reboot after installing mint you won t see an entry for it you will have to boot into ubuntu run update-grub2 to detect it and then reboot again

the mint grub should recognize both windows and ubuntu and configure them all correctly

586666
ubuntu	linux
i am aware that linux is generally a bit more technical and raw but can someone roughly outline why a linux system or in fact only that particular one since ubuntu did not do the trick is capable of still accessing communicating with a half-corrupted device when windows isn t

i started with in theory because while i know this works on linux ubuntu with mdadm i have no idea how windows will handle that

586694
folder	directory
i would like one command to copy all files not folder out of the images directory recursively to something like this

586722
put	get
sounds to me as if you bought a router from a company that specializes in hard drives i would return it saying it s defective get yourself a nice linksys cisco e4200 and put dd-wrt

586758
wan	lan
i ve never configured a router this way so i did some research and found out that since my company s network already has a dhcp server and a gateway that i have to disable dhcp on the router and plug the ethernet cable connected to my gateway into one of the lan ports not the wan port

586792
antivirus	norton
though chkdsk did find some problems on my boot drive they were repaired by chkdsk and my computer continued to express the symptoms so i assumed those disk errors were not the cause. on top of all the other problems my computer is now also reporting to me that windows is not genuine even though it has a valid serial key inputted yes i did purchase windows 7 legally so that is not the problem norton antivirus is failing to run any scans or updates google chrome crashes unexpectedly at rather normal intervals nvidia graphics updates failed to install citing no specific reason no error code report or anything of the sort and lastly windows repair install failed when attempted again citing no specific reason

packets	pcap
apparently virtualbox itself can write all packets to or from a guest to a pcap file so that might be one way to do this

586869
libpcap	wireshark
in wes morgan s answer to a similar virtualbox question he says that bridged mode is bypassing the host os network stack entirely which may mean that packets between the host and guest aren t seen by bpf on os x and thus aren t available to wireshark which uses libpcap which uses bpf on os x

the -i forces icmp instead of udp icmp being more of the universal traceroute option

586900
traceroute	packets	icmp	udp
i certainly can not speak to why microsoft did this but i will observe that in today s networking environment which is much more security conscious that access list filtering will sometimes deny udp packets to various high port numbers which is what traceroute does but may permit icmp packets

i feel that this board could be having some power saving features if there is no mouse or keyboard input for hours

sudo	passwd
if i enter in the passwd to su when prompted it doesnt work while sudo su does

587373
sudo	passwd
that s because su asks for passwd of the user you re changing into which by default is root while sudo asks for your own user account s passwd and checks if you are allowed to run the command

587375
sudo	passwd
it prompts for your passwd and checks that you re allowed to use sudo

587375
sudo	passwd
when you type sudo su you re asking to execute the command to switch to root as root so the passwd that s asked for is yours

you could set up a vpn tunnel openvpn will run over a proxy but if your firewall won t allow teamviewer traffic i don t see why it would allow vpn traffic

however while it does work when the drive is formatted as fat for some versions of windows 8 the version i want to install has a install.wim file bigger than 4gb so i have to use an ntfs filesystems on the flash drive but i cannot boot in uefi mode from it

588080

is booting from ntfs not possible in uefi mode strange as is the filesystems used by windows or am i doing something wrong

ubuntu	linux
i have a linux ubuntu 12 server and a windows desktop

588140
filesystems	ntfs
once the windows kernel has loaded and loaded its filesystems drivers if they re in separate files windows should be able to read ntfs volumes just fine

588140
filesystems	ntfs
creating two partitions -- one with a linux or os x filesystems and one with ntfs -- and putting identical files on them might be a workaround

588387
installation	upgrade
to be honest i m not aware of any utility to scan for installation errors but if you are experiencing some weird behaviour from the os you could try to reinstall the ubuntu-desktop metapackage it should reinstall everything that may be lost damaged during the upgrade

588387
kde	kubuntu
i m using kubuntu and sometimes when i get problems in updating the files of the kde environment reinstalling kubuntu-desktop which as you can guess is the equivalent to ubuntu-desktop for kubuntu solves anything

588387
versioning	upgrade
anyway from a more general point of view i found that when making major versioning upgrade it is better to use a livecd rather than using the built-in upgrade options it causes far less problems

588400

that way safari should go via the wlan while firefox goes via the lan

folder	directory
without directory hard links time machine would need to traverse all of these either on the internal disk or in the folder of the previous backup to create all hard links which would probably increase the time it took to create what is effectively a tiny backup

if i want to use sudo in another terminal in that time period i have to type passwd again

588669
ethernet	wireless
easy way to add the 2nd one would be with a usb ethernet card you may have to order online or go to a electronics store to find it as you don t want a wireless usb card for this and then use the windows internet connection sharing built right into the os or get some other program have your computer nat the connection form card one to card two then plug a ap or switch into card two and there you go

if our question was wheter or not your isp can see your traffic through vpn the answer is no except in the case it cracks the vpn tunnel which is outside of the scope of this subject

588746
disk	ram
look at what is being streched to the limit e.g do you have a problem with the cpu is the page file being used indicating more ram needed is the disk being used 100 of the time

debian	linux	ffmpeg	libav	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
the version of ffmpeg in most linux repositories is going to be quite old and in the case of debian and ubuntu et al the situation is even worse they do not provide ffmpeg but rather the fork avconv from the libav team see also lordneckbeard s answer here

588988
post	put
your post also appears somewhat contradictory with respect of what you put in the hosts file

588998
filesystems	ntfs
for all one of the reasons is that they are gpt and windows needs to be installed on a disk setup as mbr using the ntfs filesystems

589045
disk	ram
modern computers have more than enough ram and fast disk that there is little benefit from using a readyboost dedicated disk

589045

basically if you want bleeding-edge linux is a better platform to go for and it s pretty stable as well even ubuntu unity s gotten really nice in 13.04 from the perspective of a guy who uses the unity spin of that distro with his hardware currently and really digs it

589666
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian	ubuntu	debian
gentoo or lfs you have to compile everything from source in distros like arch you can either compile from source or install from binaries meanwhile distros like ubuntu fedora or debian get their stuff mostly from binaries

589666
ubuntu	linux
ultimately though it s just a matter of preference i for example prefer linux for the focus on having the newest stuff and cause i m accustomed to it the most specifically ubuntu or debian-type distros while others may prefer bsd for the stability of the packages

589687

ffmpeg	libav
in linux libav and ffmpeg also use around 40

589950
disk	ram
download memtest burn to disk and run for at least 5 hours if it finds errors then you should replace the ram and see if that fixes it but as ramhound has stated it would be good if we could see the information of the bsod so we can try and narrow down where the problem lies could be a softwrae issue

589987
versioning	upgrade
at some point perhaps when the background install finished or when i upgrade the server synergy versioning to 1.4.11 the client and the server both became unable to connect

590166
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
it allows requests to local lan addresses to use your local logical network and requests to remote lan addresses pass through the vpn tunnel

590166
tunnel	vpn
if split tunnel is not enabled the host connected to the vpn will not be able to communicate with other machines in the local lans ip range at all so its more than just a dns resolution issue

590166
lan	intranet	tunnel	lan
with split tunnel enabled if you will be accessing the intranet your default route must point to a gateway on the local lan or there will be ambiguity as to which network to use

590617
waitpid	fork
use the -f option and ssh will go into the background fork and exit in the parent process so you can just waitpid for the original ssh to finish and then you know based on exit status either that the connection failed or port forwarding is already setup

590621
stdout	stderr
if the program foo.exe is writing its output to stderr instead of stdout the output of foo.exe will not be captured by using simple redirection with a single

590621
stdout	stderr
whether a program writes a particular output to stdout or stderr is determined by the programmer and how they wrote the program

when i do resize of ff window border make window smaller or move drag window to the right i see strange freezes of ff ui

590679

591034
puts	gets
when you run under mintty the window s gets puts routines think they are not running in a command prompt so they are doing full buffering

591053

zip rar and arj are examples of such archives that are more or less supported under linux

591053
rar	zip
rar and zip do afaik know support some sort of encryption and password but these are rather poor

at least zip rar and tar support creation of archives of multiple parts

591059
tunnel	vpn
1a i read that when u use the ssl vpn tunnel encryption like the one that is implemented in the openvpn u will only be able to access the web related app only routing the internet traffic like the commercial vpn app hotspot shield

591079
tunnel	vpn
you are confusing vpn portal with a vpn tunnel

591079

591250
disk	ram
the high disk usage occurs when windows runs low on ram and begins moving the contents of the ram over to pagefile.sys

591256
put	get
i can even put in outlandish values for the crop parameters and it doesn t complain at all which suggests to me that x264 is trying to resize the input somehow before it processes my crop filter and so it errors out before i get the chance to fix things

591259
cpu	processors
the firmware control software on modern cpus produced in the last 5 years is extremely advanced and can fine tune the cpu s execution speed so that it takes advantage of all the available processors power without heating up the cpu to unsafe levels -- even if your cooling solution is sub-optimal

591263
put	get
but if i put that script in crontab which is what i really want i get

folder	dir
i can however see the copied folder and files when i do dir a from the command prompt

591382
cifs	smb
i think any answer you get will depend on what os hardware you run but in general you can just use windows filesharing also known as samba smb cifs to share the drive as this protocol is widely used and works with windows mac and pc

591382
hfs+	ntfs
i suspect that reading writing the hfs+ partition will be a big ask but your best bet is probably to change it all to 1 partition ext4 for linux ntfs for windows and just share that - it won t matter what the underlying partition is as long as the os in the fileserver can read it

width	height
set a uniform rowheight then use the width property returns column size in points and divide rowheight by it to get a unit-less height width ratio

the problem is that with zsh there is no --init-file parameter like bash has the first time ever i saw bash having a feature that zsh hasnâ t

591440
bash	zsh
named .zshrc as the names are hardcoded in zsh but bash can be passed a arbitrarily named file via --init-file

ethernet	wireless
i m not sure if that s even the correct term. i want the wnr to pick up the internet wireless and dole it out over ethernet to the revue and the revo

591612
ethernet	wireless
it cannot receive one wireless connection and then pass that connection on via wireless or ethernet

591624
ethernet	wireless
turn off the wireless connection on the laptop through software or hardware button and plug in a ethernet cable from your router to your laptop

591624
ethernet	wireless
unplug the ethernet wire and turn on wireless connection and do the same test again to check internet speed

591635
ethernet	wireless
me and my friend have both two exact the same laptops bought from the same shop at the same day and i decided one day to go wireless because i forgot my ethernet cable to the lan party with a few other laptops but this question will be specifically about these two laptops

591688
disk	ram
however if more ram is not possible due to hardware limitations or irrelevant your needs require physical disk read writes to save permanent data then an ssd is your best option or sshd hybrid drives

591696
filesystems	btrfs
after all advanced filesystems like zfs and btrfs were born to fill those gaps

591697
mouse	keyboard
is there a way to use a keyboard shortcut to move my mouse pointer to above the caret in a specific program on windows 8

591718
versioning	upgrade
first i upgrade it to the latest firmware 3.0.0.4.354 because i was a few versioning back but i then downgraded back one firmware 3.0.0.4.270 to see if it resolved my issue

591721
min	max
when not-maximised the tabs appear underneath the firefox logo and min max closed buttons as pictured below

591802
ubuntu	linux
also during ubuntu installation you can format that partition in ext4 instead of ntfs which is better for linux use and add another small partition to use as swap

591832
x86	64bit	folder	directory
application s directory - the folder where an app is installed usually located in c program files or c program files x86 if it s a 32-bit program installed in a 64bit os

591832
folder	directory
in the latter case remember that you ll have to move that folder to appropriate directory - songbird is a 32-bit app so it will probably be installed in program files x86 on the new pc but in program files on the old one

591843
mouse	trackpad
both the trackpad and an external mouse will continue to work but it doesn t seem to affect the random jumps

591849
filtering	grouping
then in grouping policy management change the security filtering setting for the policy so it only applies to that grouping instead of all authenticated users

591851
cpu	processors
in cases where the cpu is powerful enough is it better to set cpu as the physx processors

591851
cpu	processors
in general is it better to set cpu as physx processors when the cpu is powerful enough

591852
folder	directory
is there any way to restore these folder to factory default or just live with a garbage dump of a windows directory

591858
cpu	processors
emulation physical processors physx on intel cpu s just worse. use nvidia physx physical processors

591866
smarthost	exim

591866
starttls	smtps
secure-email-32.luxsci.com offers starttls extension of esmtp protocol your mta exim can turn unencrypted smtps connection into encrypted one the same tcp connection

591866
starttls	smtps
secure-email-32.luxsci.com offers only plain text methods of smtps auth login and plain so your exim should use them after starttls command

591940
installation	upgrade
got the software from a salesperson who said it can be for non-upgrades and clearly has no upgrade label on the box and after installing lo and behold windows is complaining that my key is no good because i didn t have a previous installation of windows this specific product key can only be used for upgrading not clean installation

591940
versioning	upgrade
background i didn t mention that i actually bought 2 identical copies of the exact same box and product number both windows 8 pro not labeled as upgrade versioning

591940
versioning	upgrade
well i thought this was best buy s fault because it seemed like they must have handed us 2 upgrade versioning

591942
versioning	upgrade
you seem fairly positive that this is not an upgrade versioning

591944
traceroute	packets
as for assigning fault based on traceroutes i ve professionally done senior-level network operations for over a decade with full access to switches and routers error counts traffic levels cache flows -- all manners of stats and metrics -- giving me visibility well beyond what a simple traceroute could provide yet determining where packets loss was occurring to a host on a remote network was still an inexact art mostly because the return path from the other host was obscured unless i had a traceroute back to me from the remote host i could only guess at how return traffic was getting back to my workstation

bluetooth	usb
there are many usb-attached bluetooth host controllers letting a user to attach a bluetooth device to a computer having usb ports but no integrated bluetooth support

592111
bluetooth	usb
a way to connect a conventional wired usb device to a computer having integrated bluetooth host controller but no usb ports

592114
packets	multicast
the ideal solution would be a wired connection from the server to your router and some kind of multicast protocol that allows you to transmit the entire file once with every client listening to the one broadcast and any missed packets can be requested at the end of the transmission

592119
udp	tcp
basically this specifies how big of a packet that the local network link can handle...this is a layer 2 size commonly ethernet so ip tcp udp and other headers count against this value

592121
wan	lan
this is logical the local network are on the wan side of the netgear router so from the perspective of the router they belong to the internet not the lan

592121
wan	lan
netgear connected trough lan and wan ports

592121
wan	lan
netgear connected trough lan and wan ports and dhcp re-enabled

592121
wan	lan
did you try connecting the wan of netgear to a lan on the other router

592121
wan	lan
the netgear router does not bridge dhcp requests between lan and wan so guest machines would not work unless their ip is configured manually

592121
wan	lan
the netgear to the modem and connect the other router s wan to a lan

592164
google-chrome	firefox
i am huge fan of the firefox extension and am looking for something like this for google-chrome

592168
google-chrome	firefox
if that doesn t work try installing firefox or google-chrome then uninstalling ie then using google-chrome or firefox re-install ie

592187
mamp	wamp
what i want to do is have mamp and wamp on the thumb drive running off the same database and webroot never concurrently obviously

592187
mamp	wamp
research has proved fruitless the most help i ve found is importing a mamp environment into wamp

592187
mamp	wamp
is it possible practical to run mamp and wamp off the same database webroot

592210
gentoo	linux
you may opt to install gentoo linux itself if you come across more problems it is lightweight enough compared to lfs and you can always try to trim it down if you feel it is not

592221
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vlan
but if that traffic is segregated through say vlan tagging or some kind of higher-layer tunnel the primary router needs to know how to do the right thing with that traffic that is decapsulate it and send it only to the internet and not let it route back onto the lan

592225
folder	directory
in order not to override every time permissions on the files and folder and manipulate only the security groups in active directory

592230
wan	lan
did you try connecting the wan of netgear to a lan on the other router and then disabling dhcp on netgear and enabling guest mode

592230
wan	lan
do not connect both wan and lan ports of the netgear to the other router

592230
wan	lan
even if you disable dhcp on one router it still makes no sense to connect both lan and wan

592230
wan	lan
connect wan of netgear to lan of other router

592230
wan	lan
the solution would be to reverse the routers connect the wan port of the netgear to the modem and connect the other router s wan to a lan on the netgear

592283
filesystems	ntfs
what you can do however is to restore the image temporarily on a 160gb disk use a filesystems resize tool such as ntfsresize for ntfs or resize2fs for ext3 4 to shrink the filesystems say to 25gb

592316
wan	lan
this is the problem -- you should not connect a lan port to a wan port other than connecting a router to a modem unless you have a very unusual reason to do so

592316
wan	lan
move the connection to the first router from the second router s wan port to one of its lan ports

592324
sudo	passwd
since root is disabled by default and for good reason and has no passwd you can use sudo which grants you elevated privileges for one command to overrule that rule

592324
sudo	passwd
when sudo prompts you for your passwd

592327
octal	decimal
note that chmod doesn t expect the permissions to be expressed in decimal or hexadecimal so this octal prefix is optional

592351
google-chrome	firefox
in order to use ie 10 firefox nightly or google-chrome in metro mode as a windows 8 fullscreen pinnable app i have to set it as the default immediately forcing all other browsers to only run on the desktop

592353
logmein	hamachi
if you or your admin are aiming at using an x window system basic window manager try something like an nx server or hamachi logmein and remote login instead of putty ssh or just get used to ls s and cd s

592387
lan	localhost
i have my config files setup so that i am able to access my server through localhost and localhost 8181 all i did was add listen 8181 in ports.conf when i m connected to my lan

592388
hid	keyboard
be aware though that what seems to be simple drive might in fact be a device like the usb rubber ducky which registers as a hid keyboard to the pc and upon connection performs a set of predefined keystrokes

592440
filesystems	ntfs
just some thoughts i was looking for something else and found your question maybe the copy procedure converted the unicode encoded characters in the name to some other format or stripped some characters off of one of the names so that the names of the files would only contain a set of characters that a given filesystems allows ntfs forbids chars like

592463
postgresql	mysql
create database postgresql or mysql import your data into database - one file in one row add fts full text search index

range	minimum
but due to newer requirement to the maximum and minimum value the numeric data i have to modified a lot of cells setting the value of each cell to its current value except if it is out of range in that case i should just take the minimum value or the maximum and store it in the same cell

592641
mouse	keyboard
i have a keyboard and mouse that came with a usb transmitter receiver for lack of the right word

592641
bluetooth	usb	mouse	keyboard
is there a way to get my keyboard and mouse to talk directly to the bluetooth on my computer so i don t have to use up a usb port for the transmitter

592641
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard mouse combo is the

592645
mouse	keyboard
go into the bluetooth devices section of your computer and configure it to connect to your keyboard and mouse

592645
mouse	keyboard
this may not be possible if your keyboard and mouse are only configured to work via usb port

592685
folder	directory
i have 3 users created and i have installed and configured or so i thought vsftp to jail users to their own home directory but it s not working they can browse right to the route folder

592689
disk	ram
i d argue that if you ever end up paging out to disk regardless of where that disk is hdd ssd you should probably consider adding more ram to the system

592697
mouse	keyboard
the advantage to a docking station is that other cables like ethernet keyboard mouse can be plugged in and left connected

592723

592824
udp	tcp
however by default it s udp port 53 and tcp port 53 is not often used

592824
udp	tcp
your dig and nslookup commands use udp by default but in your dig command you specified to use tcp with +tcp and since the router is only listening on udp the request fails

i am aware of linux mode on freebsd where linux binaries can seamlessly be executed in freebsd

593188
freebsd	linux
in effect there is a linux kernel in the freebsd kernel

593188

filesystems	ntfs
changing the filesystems type back to ntfs using linux does the trick

submit	submission
what you need to do is not load the page fill in the form and submit it - but instead just submit the same data directly to the same place that submission the form manually would normally do

593366
installation	upgrade
my processor is 64-bit but my current installation of windows 7 is 32-bit meaning that trying to upgrade from windows 7 to windows 8 through the upgrade assistant would give me a 32-bit iso image which is not what i want

593372
post	get
if not there s apparently a way to get apple script to do this according to this stack overflow post

593389
google-chrome	firefox
so greasemonkey scripts also work in google-chrome and not only in firefox

593396
folder	directory
in a directory there are many folder .html inside i would like all html parsed as new .txt with the name of the parent directory

593423
jobs	cron
how exatly does cron in ubuntu execute jobs

593423
jobs	cron
say i have two cron jobs

593443
mouse	keyboard
how can i do that without the mouse only using the keyboard

593445
daemon	cron
every minute the cron daemon reads all the crontab files and loads them into memory

593445
jobs	cron
cron itself only forks the child processes that manage the jobs

593445
jobs	cron
so the cron entries are run concurrently - if one job takes an hour for example it will not impact on the execution of any other cron jobs

593453
opensuse	mint
for a replacement distribution you should consider opensuse solusos or mint

593484
bash	zsh
i m not aware of anything that works like zsh s vared in bash out of the box

mouse	keyboard
warning do not suspend dwm.exe by mistake or you will be effectively locked out and need to reboot explanation it processes all input from mouse keyboard and winlogon.exe will not detect it should be restarted if it s suspended nor will it release input to be used in non-dwm mode

593681

593737
parallels	bootcamp
i ve heard parallels can run a bootcamp install virtually

593781
stdout	stderr
redirect stdout and stderr

593784
hash	md5
however you can always recompile ps from source and compare the md5 hash of both

593808
folder	directory
try pressing shift + del on the root directory which will permanently delete the folder s

593815
unix	bsd
if you only need to access it from other linux unix bsd systems you should probably be okay with formatting it with some ext filesystem i would recommend ext4

593817
stdout	stderr
what you probably intended to write is a cd command with redirection of both stderr and stdout to dev null

593817
stdout	stderr
this first redirects stderr file descriptor 2 into file descriptor 1 stdout then redirects stdout implicit 1 into dev null

593829
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu you can use debsums

593844
ubuntu	linux
thus if you don t have advanced knowledge of linux you should boot from a linux cd the ubuntu install cd usb and run gparted from there

593850
versioning	upgrade
you ll then need to do an apt-get update apt-get dist-upgrade and watch your system upgrade to the specified versioning

593854
macbook	bootcamp
i just removed the os x partition on a 2011 macbook air leaving only the bootcamp partition

593863
integer	unsigned
greatest unsigned integer that can be saved in cpu s machine word

593863
16-bit	64bit
intel 8086 cpu was 16-bit and it was addressing memory by bytes so do modern 32-bit and 64bit cpus

593866
disk	ram
when real memory becomes over-committed and the system begins to thrash as it swaps pages of memory back and forth between ram and disk performance plummets

593869
mp3	flv
when a certain file mp4 flv etc has a 95 kbps audio bitrate - does it make sense outputing to a higher bitrate when converting to mp3 or other format be it lossy or not

593883
centos	linux	debian	linux	debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
it seems to me that every linux distro that i ssh into or use locally mostly rhel centos and debian ubuntu machines have a different idea about which of .bashrc and .bash_profile to run when i log in locally when i ssh in when i open tmux or when running shell commands from within vim

593883
kde	kubuntu
i might log in from the computer itself a kubuntu desktop in a kde session via konsole or i might ssh in from home to the same machine

593979
mp3	ogg
to offer a different perspective imagine that every time you make a lossy-compressed audio file mp3 ogg aac it s like dubbing a cassette tape

594009
ubuntu	linux
i have a windows host and a linux ubuntu guest

594010
filesystems	hfs+
i ve thinked to tune the two hfs+ journaled filesystems with the e o and s parameters for the sleep partition and with the f m and o parameters for the swap one

594044
decoder	encoder
actually a bit more than proportionally because the second encoder when cascaded with the first decoder will always introduce an additional quality loss unless you re using two lossless formats that has to be compensated even if you can t compensate all of it

594059
ubuntu	linux
but what i need is an iso for the case when the guest is linux ubuntu

594131
cpu	processors
among the processors in this list at the end of some cpu names there are letters like k s t u m me

594156
mouse	keyboard
so i installed windows from scratch and now it has both os s but the problem is that as far as i know the only windows drivers present are the drivers for the keyboard mouse usb and cd without counting video drivers and such .the core problem is how can i install the rest of the drivers internet sound etc with the restriction that i have no password to complete boot camp final step

filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
it s helpful to know that once the space management system of a filesystems â the library that allows the filesystems to know what files are stored where the file allocation table of a fat filesystems the master file table of an ntfs system or the superblock and the inode list of an ext filesystems if i m not mistaken â i am not very familiar with ext filesystems has been deleted it doesn t make any difference what the filesystems was the medium is now nothing more than a vast space of binary storage for which you have no map â to find individual files - you have to scan the entire space for meaningful chunks that might be indicative of file content

another drawback to ntfs compression is that because it is a filesystems attribute it is compressed only on the filesystems

595022
filesystems	ntfs
note if you use linux and windows then you can use ntfs for both computer filesystems and your flash drives but if you use mac os x then getting ntfs working is a pain and not worth it

597211
wan	lan
the linksys has a 192.168.1.x address on it s wan interface and then is using 10.78.84.x on its lan interface so clients on 192.168.1.x don t know anything about 10.78.84.x and any attempt to contact them will generally be forwarded to your default gw which is your upstream internet connection to solve this what you want to do is turn the n900 smart wifi router into a bridge telling it to not do address translation or routing

597211
wan	lan
if that isn t possible in the settings you can disable dhcp on it and instead of plugging the the wan link into the 192.168.1.x network plug a lan port in there

597234
filesystems	ntfs
for example you could have it formatted ext4 or something a bit more modern with high performance and mount it as a samba share on windows and mac therefore eliminating any filesystems conflicts and requirements on proprietary software such as paragon ntfs

597636
sudo	passwd
is there a way to automate this in putty so i don t have to type sudo -i and the passwd

597646
sudo	passwd
it might also be possible to configure sudo to not require a passwd for your account or globally but this will of course mean that anyone who can get their hands on a connected session will have complete access to the entire system just by doing a single sudo

versioning	upgrade
since you seem to have clean installed win8 upgrade on an empty drive it s quite likely you will not be able to activate successfully the upgrade versioning requires a qualifying older versioning of the os to be already installed

598784
versioning	upgrade
win8 upgrade replaces your older os license vista in your case so you can no longer use that vista key again as long as you re using the win8 upgrade versioning

i ve tested it on a h.264 video stream in an mp4 container

599698

599737
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is a journaled filesystems which requires additional information to be stored like the master file table and several other hidden metafiles

599739
ubuntu	linux
afaik each linux distro fedora ubuntu etc keeps its network settings in different file dir structures with maybe even different properties inside

599741
iboutlet	ibaction
although it is an older question but still i will like to answer as i have also the same problem while using right click drag its generally used in xcode for connecting storyboard iboutlet and ibaction

599785
filesystems	ntfs
to get more space and a faster access i can mount an ntfs partition from a hard disk after bootup then use the loopback device to mount a filesystems image from there to replace home or even chroot into it but that is way after the bootup process making system updates impossible

599789
filesystems	xfs
have a read of the xfs documentation and come to understand how the filesystems is built

599789
filesystems	xfs
xfs is designed for massive hundreds-of-terabytes filesystems living on sans worth more than a house storing massive uncompressed media files like professional movie studios would need

cloud storage services such as dropbox google drive and skydrive all provide a limited amount of free online storage

599842
folder	directory
as i understand it groups in active directory are intended to simplify among others the management of permissions on files and folder instead of specifying that a specific directory can be accessed by user 1 and user 5 and user 7 and user 19 etc. one can simply create a group and set the permission for this group

600049
tunnel	wan
i have no idea how you would securely do windows file sharing over the wan though ssh tunnel would work if you can figure that out

600075
filesystems	ntfs
i ask this because my digital sat pvr s hard disk was showing a buggy behavior so i have attached the hd to my pc however as it uses a proprietary filesystems xtv i have formatted it with ntfs and issued chkdsk f r to verify sectors as a result 24 sectors were marked as bad

600082
filesystems	ntfs
as for your question the chkdsk f r command marks bad sectors only on the filesystems levelâ â the information about those sectors is stored only in ntfs structures and is lost when the disk is reformatted

600169
folder	directory
recent places is a virtual folder meaning there s no actual directory in the file system for it

600193
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
setfattr probably works for ntfs filesystems but in case someone needs to do the same for fat vfat fat16 fat32 filesystems see mtools package

600246
folder	directory
but part of the plugin s power is that it can detect a .git folder in the parent directory tree and i imagine keeping the cache there would be most efficient for my standard situation

600315
chown	chmod
i ve tried chown ing and chmod ing anything in etc and etc local but i always get operation not permitted

600369
wan	lan
if i ping any of the lan devices using their hostname ping returns the external wan ip address instead of the lan ip

600503
arp	icmp
but the problem starts when it keeps on capturing the icmp dns and arp requests too

600505
disk	ram
no hdd - running purely on ram disk boot using usb and usb creates a ram disk - the only possible issue with this is that you may have to re-install the os every single time since ram is volatile and will be wiped everytime you powered down your laptop

600520
switching	screens
you can press win + p to switching display modes try making sure it s set at duplicate so your image is being sent both to the screens and your external monitor

600529
mouse	keyboard
connecting a normal mouse keyboard that doesnâ t have them reversed would cause ahk to reverse them

i checked the server s log and any other requests get post put... but the options ones made it to the server

600609

you may use tcp ip to drive the logic of the exchange behavior control and use udp for the data

600609
udp	tcp
first layer udp assumes discovery and data second layer built on tcp to offer sessions management

600619

how do i need to connect my lan cables into wan or lan plugs in the router

600755
wan	lan
you then disconnect anything from their wan port and connect them to the other router using the lan ports on each

600756
sudo	passwd
sudo means you will have to put the admin passwd in when you run this command

600772
jobs	cron
sometimes i have issues with cron jobs not running and diagnosing why can be difficult

600772
jobs	cron
what would be useful is to switch to the same user as the cron jobs run under so i can see if there s a permissions hassle or something

600804
mouse	keyboard
for each usb hub i ticked allow the computer to turn off this device to save power and i had to go through every keyboard mouse device an un-tick allow this device to wake the computer

601045
debian	linux
the os running in raspberrypi is debian linux raspbian

601051
apache	nginx
the reversed proxy putting nginx between user and apache saves you time cause apache is responding to 127.0.0.1 which is on the same machine as if you are accessing localhost

601051
apache	nginx
so apache client will always be nginx and the response from apache is a static content which will make you get the best of nginx as it is faster than apache in serving this content

601072
nfa	dfa
technical answer traditionally egrep used a deterministic finite automaton dfa internally while grep used a non-deterministic finite automaton nfa

601072
nfa	dfa
these days gnu grep and egrep take a hybrid nfa dfa approach

601072
nfa	dfa
according to friedl s book mastering regular expressions to discover if your egrep for example has an nfa engine or if it has a dfa engine try

601072
nfa	dfa
if it finishes quickly it s either a dfa or an nfa with some advanced optimization

601072
nfa	dfa
friedl describes the nfa engine as regex-directed and the dfa as text-directed

601072
nfa	dfa
the consequence is that there are some pattern text combinations that are matched more quickly by a dfa and some that are matched more quickly by an nfa

601072
nfa	dfa
according to freidl gnu grep uses a dfa when possible and reverts to an nfa when back-references are used

601091
ssd	sata
i have the fear that if i simply install the driver and attach the sata cable of my ssd from the internal sata port to the new controller i get an inaccesible boot device bluescreen

601093
macports	homebrew
there is a nice and short comparison of homebrew with macports at

601093
macports	homebrew
the main points are that homebrew generally does not require you to add sudo and that macports requires xcode and a specific x11 to be installed first but has many more packages

601101
ssd	sata
this was to maximize a sata iii ssd into my system that had sata ii ports on the motherboard

601114
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is one of the more popular and user-friendly linux distros

google-chrome	firefox
the certificate generates an error in firefox and google-chrome saying

601314
google-chrome	firefox
as a result i would expect firefox and google-chrome to trust it because by adding it to my trusted certificate store i have declared it s legitimate

601329
google-chrome	firefox
have you added the self-signing ca s certificate to firefox s and google-chrome s certificate or just the self-signed cert itself

601329
google-chrome	firefox
if you create a self-signing ca as here and then import its root certificate into firefox and google-chrome they should be able to match the self-signed cert up with its root ca cert and you should no longer have the issue

evilsoup already hinted at it but to state it clearly aliases in zsh and bash are not able to take arguments whereas in csh they can

601607
disk	ram
i m being told that linux manages its memory efficiently and i think using spare ram to speed up disk access is great so i m suspecting there s something wrong with my configuration

rank	percentile
so i am filling a cell with blue green yellow or red based on a percentile rank that is returned that is numbers like

601652
folder	directory
open a command prompt and change to the directory containing the bad folder

601652
folder	directory
in both cases be careful that the bad folder is the only thing in the directory otherwise you ll get weird and potentially destructive behavior

601668
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
because while linux can read and write to ntfs partitions windows cannot without third-party software read or write to any type of filesystems aside from fat or ntfs

601672
mouse	keyboard
how can i move an individual point with arrow keys of the keyboard but not with mouse

601676
dpkg	apt
if that doesn t work have a look at which processes are actually using apt or dpkg

601683
ubuntu	debian
previous versions of debian and ubuntu had a bug that caused them to wipe the contents of the esp during installation

601683
debian	linux
you should back up the esp using windows or a linux live cd before installing debian

601692
rank	percentile
i know this does not answer the question but is a relatively simple way to address a problem of this kind assuming that the percentile rank is not returned by a calculation within excel

601729
filesystems	ntfs
after breaking the array you may possibly be able to mount the first drive with a valid but degraded ntfs filesystems

601745
disk	ram
if it s not risky will the performance improvement on the ram disk be similar to that of unencrypted files

601745
disk	ram
there is a reference to using a ram disk on the tc faq where they discuss mounting the drive so as not to leave traces of your use of tc

601752
disk	ram
don t use a ram disk for general system use

601752
disk	ram
let windows use that 8-16gb of ram to boost performance of files and programs you use often as it will be much much more effective at finding the blocks on disk that you use most and keeping them in memory

601792

601840
put	get
click next till you get to scope and put the ip address in the remote ip section

601868
disk	ram
as darth explained using a ram disk in general is normally not a good idea but more importantly encrypting one is utterly pointless because the purpose of encrypting a drive is to protect its contents while the system is off and a ramdisk no longer exists when the system is off

601886
subnet	vlan
because pc_1 and pc_2 uses 2 different subnet i cant connect them together.at the router i have lets say the ip address 10.1.1.65 at the fa0 0 but that way i can only send messages from pc_2.and when i try 10.1.1.17 it only sends messages from pc_1.i made all the appropriate static routing and i think the vlan things ..though i think that something has to be done with vlan database with the access and trunk registers..if anyone knows it would be really helpfull thank you

i want to use the ssd to contain my windows and programs leaving my data on the sata drive

602034

i had the great pleasure to experience that very problem after an update of saitek keyboard mouse drivers through windows update new rule #34 never do such a thing always use constructor files from their websites and let me tell you that i was beginning to lose my computer latin as i m a computer engineer... and all the related comments on the net weren t of a nature to relieve the stress.

you can determine the short names by running the command dir x from a command prompt after changing directory to the parent of the folder you want the 8.3 name for

602232
debian	linux
i ve been running debian gnu linux for several years

602237

apt-get upgrade this will upgrade any installed packages to their latest versioning

602250
gmail	outlook.com
my only other idea is set up an email address on another email service like outlook.com or something then have gmail forward everything to that

602261
disk	ram
as some have pointed out the performance gains from ram disk shown in benchmarks may not be greater than the performance losses from the decrease in memory available to windows for caching

602261
disk	ram
nevertheless with respect to my question there isn t a good reason to expect that performance of a truecrypt drive stored in a ram disk would be an exceptional case in this regard

602261
disk	ram
if ram disk are faster than hdd+cache for 8 gb of unencrypted files ram disk will probably also be faster for an 8 gb truecrypt container

602261
disk	ram
regarding stability using ram disk software that periodically writes the data to the disk helps boost stability but it only partially resolves the instability issue

602261
disk	ram
combining this instability with the risk of data lost due to encryption which is always a risk however small using a truecrypt container in a ram disk does present an additional stability risk

602273

tunnel	vpn
you ll look legit to web sites but actions in the vm won t be tied to actions outside of the vm except by your ip address which you can change with a proxy vpn ssh tunnel or similar

602369
hotmail	outlook.com
supported services include hotmail outlook.com facebook twitter linkedin google and sina weibo

602372
post	put
another case would be if the client is in the middle of sending a request with a body such as put or post and the server discovers an error replies with an error and tears down its side of the connection without waiting for the client to finish transmitting the body

602381
daemons	systemd
this will allow the daemons to use the cap_dac_override capability and read the local file systemd without changing permissions ownership

602420
chown	chmod
additionally when i try to chown or chmod the file folder in terminal the command seems to work but when i then try ls -l on the file folder it becomes apparent the command hasn t done anything

cpu	processors
i have a laptop with i7 processors and ati video card all the distros i v installed have a common problem -- there is always a kworker kernel thread occupy 40 of the cpu one of the 8 logical cpu is always 90 and the system feels a little laggy

602528
folder	directory
this is just a guess but since most personal configurations are stored in the library folder in your home directory users yourloginname library i would hold off on that folder until the very end

602559
folder	directory
via the cli tool you can then exclude directory that you dont want to have synced possibly you only want one specific folder to be synced how to use

602559
put	get
note that you should not put your most securest information in that dropbox sync there are probably multiple points where someone in the worst case could get hold of that information so only use it for information that basically is not of interest for anyone and more or less public information anyway

602583
google-chrome	firefox
i solved a crash problem in firefox and mute sound in google-chrome with flash

602596
google-chrome	firefox
downloading the same file in google-chrome or firefox works fine

602618
tunnel	vpn
the problem is that windows 7 tries to accept incoming vpn connections using all protocol it could support and this includes sstp secure socket tunnel protocol

602618
ssl	https
sstp is basically ppp tunneled over ssl and by default it uses the same port 443 as usual https connections

602912
sudoers	visudo
you can edit etc sudoers with sudo visudo which will use your editor to edit the file

ubuntu	linux
easiest option in my opinion would be to boot a live linux disc ubuntu may be the easiest and run boot-repair

602933
post	get
i will get the head tag info asap and post it here

602938
google-chrome	firefox
firefox had flashgot which added all the links available in a page and you could choose files by type etc but in google-chrome how do i do this

602950
debian	linux
also transcoding to a different format or with a different source works well without -r option i tried with ffmpeg 0.7.13 and 1.2.1 on mac os provided by mac ports and 0.7.15 on a debian linux server

602988
move	drag
windows doesn t provide a built-in way to change the default action of drag and drop but i found a tool called drag n drop editor which will let you change the default action to move

bash	zsh
for reference and as i m not completely sure how bash behaves exactly i quote from the a user s guide to the z-shell by peter stephenson the current maintainer of zsh

603038
vpn	lan
and the farp plugin will fake arp replies for these ips so that vpn clients seem to be part of the same subnet as the other lan hosts

603051
debian	linux
maybe it is relevant that i m producing this on a debian vps because i don t have access to an actual linux pc currently.

603073
hide	show
let s say i hide column a in excel or in google doc how can i unhide it show column a again

603156
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can apply the same directives you use in .htaccess files in your httpd.conf you just need to place them in the section probably the one that deals with your webroot

603156
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you want to make use of an .htaccess in a specific directory you can either use allowoverride authconfig everywhere so that you can add users per directory site if you chose or specifically for that directory in your httpd.conf

with pipelining the server - client direction of the pipe is constantly full for max throughput and minimum latency

603323
mp4	webm
it seems that google stamp all mp4 flv and 3gp files including the original one you upload with this record of the server location and we observe interestingly that google doesn t for any webm files

603330
bash	zsh
i ve done similar in bash and zsh

603362
folder	directory
i am surprised thunderbird doesn t store mail by some sort of hashing algorithm to prevent precisely this problem - but it wouldn t be compatible with the way the folder are mirrored in a local directory structure i suppose

603391
rpm	yum
based on the names above i used yum search and find some rpm packages to fulfill the dependencies

603409
parallels	bootcamp
the switch from os x to windows was necessitated by the need to use specialized windows software that the manufacturer could not guarantee would run properly under bootcamp or parallels

603409
filesystems	ntfs
i am not certain whether fat32 or ntfs would be the best filesystems for the external drive nor whether there would be any problems with copying the resource forks of the files to the external non-hfs+ drive

603418
folder	directory
i would like to make a log of all newly created files and or folder under a particular directory

603460
ssl	https
if you are not using ssl https the data of the package can also be read

603460
tunnel	vpn
to avoid this you can use a tunnel ssh vpn

603465
tunnel	vpn
your best bet is either to tunnel out via a secure proxy vpn or to use a hostname on your pc that can t be traced back to you individually

603514
min	max
most custom themes are visual styles which can change the complete windows look - including the min max close buttons

603569
udp	tcp
openvpn uses tcp 1194 and udp 443

603569
ssl	https
if https comes up in the browser and works port 443 is likely working has to be for ssl to work

603576
tunnel	vpn
if i were you i d see about renting a server in spain you can get a pretty small vps and set up a vpn or just do ssh tunnel

when i run a sudo command after binding my linux machine to an ad domain using samba winbind it takes anywhere between 10 seconds and 2 minutes to respond before prompting for my passwd

604065
short	base
so long story short it s very likely that the usage on your local base station is higher than the amount of bandwidth they ve dedicated to it

604070
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu markets itself for the new linux user and takes every opportunity to make the switch easier

604070
ubuntu	mint
mint is not ubuntu they take what they like of the ubuntu fork and make the rest less ubuntu

604104
mouse	keyboard
so the mouse movements or keyboard clicks may be being received from the mouse or keyboard just fine but the software can t service them

604146
mouse	keyboard
there s little point in resetting the bios when it works on the live usb especially if the mouse and keyboard work in the bios

604158
mouse	keyboard
the os automatically installed the software for the wireless keyboard and mouse

604165
stdout	stderr
it may be that the application doesn t output to stdout or stderr but try this

604182
put	get
or you can disable dhcp on your router completely - just note that no pc s on your network will get internet unless you put in static ip address details

604198
kde	kubuntu
i m using network manager on kubuntu 12.04 with kde 4.10.2 and sometimes when i plug in the phone even if it correctly detected by the system it is listed in the removable devices list it is not seen from network manager

604268
ethernet	wireless
when you tried to talk to the server the most likely decision your laptop will make is that 192.168.1.1 is on the local network so just send the request out the local ethernet or wireless so the traffic will hit your router which assumes the request is for it has it has the same ip address

604286
wan	lan	wan	subnet

604286

i read some post on the net that by default that what i will get with this setup

604288
subnet	packets
you don t actually want two separate subnet on each side of the wd n600 especially not with a nat gateway in between because a natural side-effect of nat technically a napt in this case is that it acts like a bit of a stateful packets inspection spi firewall and doesn t allow flows connections to be initiated from the upstream public side of the nat to the downstream private side of the nat

604289
wan	lan

604387
mouse	keyboard
this means -again unless special care is taken- that you can not use an usb based keyboard or mouse before the os load

604650
wan	lan
what you d need to do is set up a firewall rule redirecting wan port 80 to the port 80 of your vaio on the lan side

604650
wan	lan
be careful to choose wan to lan since the lan to lan option should be the one that you use to access the configuration

604661
migrate	upgrade
as i ve upgrade from an old disk to a new one and decided to rather re-install the os than copy an image and drag along all the crap accumulated over the years i thought it would be a good idea to run the old os in a virtual machine thus making the transition easier in case of need i d still have access to the old machine during the time i m setting up the new one and not everything is migrate yet

udp	tcp
way to absolutely block ssh is to deny all tcp or udp connections from

604764
filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs
a good compression zip like 7zip should be able to make smaller files maybe faster and keep the data you need without stuff like block data for whatever filesystems your dmgs use hfs udf and fat are some of the options

bash	zsh
i know about preexec hooks for zsh and the way this can be achieved in bash

ssd	sata
to relate to your question more directly if the ssd is connected by a sata interface i am sure you will notice a very good improvement in boot times and commonly used programs

605177
factors	mean
do you mean the drive capacity or the form factors 3.5 or 2.5

605184
wan	lan
3 connect one of the wireless router s lan port not the wan port

605185
wan	lan
you should have your router sit between the lan and the wan not as an end-node on the lan

605185
wan	lan
most home routers will have a few lan ports and one wan port and you will probably run into problems using a single interface to have a public and private ip and routing between them

605196
chown	mount
but it requires root permissions twice to chown the files and to mount the image

605279
disk	ram
you could make a read-only ram disk

i m running debian and ubuntu guests under the same virtualbox hosted under win7

605418

i don t want a completely passwordless sudo but donâ t want to be typing passwd all the time either

605431
sudo	passwd
i don t understand why you don t want this it is as simple as running sudo passwd

i want the macro to automatically paste the screenshot then re-size it to fit to a height of 5.9 inches and a width of 10 inches

605442
width	height
the current macro that i m using works perfectly as long as the screenshot isn t to tall in height but i want it to adjust to the nearest width 10 or height 5.9 which ever one comes first

605445
debian	linux
my gnu linux desktop is debian wheezy and the sound is provided by pulseaudio

605460
bash	zsh
adding the space allows bash to recognize boot27 but the problem now is that your root account is not set to use zsh so sudo starts a bash shell instead

605460
bash	zsh
nocorrect is a zsh thing bash has no idea what it is so it complains

605470
google-chrome	firefox
from the manufacturer s specification page the dvr appears to work with the firefox google-chrome browsers as well

605474
daemons	systemd
you would also need another program daemons running in parallel to update the file which would just contain the current text to be displayed but this program would be fairly trivial assuming you could synchronize it with the systemd clock

605482

i had a similar issue in an earlier versioning of 10.8 but it went away after i did an upgrade install from the recovery partition

605556
versioning	upgrade
i find it very strange and have tried to upgrade my graphics card driver nvidia geforce gt 620m versioning 9.18.13.2018 with no luck

605566
postfix	dovecot
by default both postfix and dovecot use local accounts for everything

605566
postfix	dovecot
if you have a linux account named diti you can log into dovecot with it and you can set up postfix to validate smtp logins against dovecot

605566
postfix	dovecot
make sure both files are owned by and readable by the ssl-cert group so that postfix and dovecot could access them

605566
starttls	smtps
# this allows starttls to be used on all incoming smtps connections

605566
postfix	dovecot
first tell postfix to use dovecot to verify logins

605566
postfix	dovecot
dovecot s etc dovecot conf.d 10-master.conf needs to listen on a socket that postfix could access

605566
postfix	dovecot
now you still have one account called diti as far as postfix and dovecot are concerned but mail sent to kra .

mp3	wav
audacity is a free sound editor that can covert pcm files to wav mp3 and many other formats

605615

605700
ssd	sata
install an eide ssd inside an older model laptop or desktop which would take eide drives and install a sata ssd inside a newer model laptop or desktop which takes sata drives

605700
ssd	sata
the sata ssd drives are less expensive than the eide ssd drives since all eide drives are being phased out

605700
ssd	sata
sata drives are faster than eide ones but eide ssd drives are faster than conventional eide drives just as sata ssd drives are faster than conventional sata drives

605704
disk	ram
hibernation is supposed to write out ram contents to disk and coming back from hibernation is supposed to fill back ram with saved contents

605709
disk	ram
reading and writing to a physical disk is much slower than from ram

605709
disk	ram
a ssd will have almost the same resume speed from disk as from ram

605714
disk	ram
while ram is very fast the hard disk is the exact opposite

605714
disk	ram
imagine you have to copy your ram contents which might be about 16 gb from the hard disk

605740
switching	screens
the answer propsed in simultaneously switching tags as one screens in multi monitor setup

605744
mrtg	snort
technologies like netflow ntop mrtg and idpss like snort can gather statistical information so you can determine what if any source is driving an unusual amount of traffic to your server but these all require some network infrastructure to set up

605744
tunnel	packets
technologies that proxy tunnel connections web proxies darknets tor i2p etc ssh relays vpns etc generally rewrite the source ip in each packets to provide their own so that replies get relayed back through the proxy

605755
wan	lan
i also have a more powerful dd-wrt router with a wan port and 4 lan ports

605755
wan	lan
the wan port of the dd-wrt router is connected to a lan port of the dsl modem router

605755
pppoe	dhcp
the dd-wrt router does pppoe dialing and login and is the gateway of my home network which handles dhcp and nat in addition to qos

605755
wan	lan
the idea is that since i m not using the dsl modem router as a router anyway i can just use the three free lan ports as a switch the other lan port is connected to the dd-wrt s wan port to do pppoe passthrough

605758
portrait	landscape
is there a way that i can set the footer up so that it works in landscape and portrait

605758
portrait	landscape

605785
screens	tablet
well with support for opengl 2.0 it is possible to run side by side not only windows and linux as i do now but also android os and its application at full speed using windroy and since the dell 1090 has a multi-touch capable screens it would be the fastest highest resolution largest storage capacity and most versatile windows linux android multi-os fully convertible tablet available

ati	nvidia
there are a few things you have to watch for like don t install the ati graphics drivers if you don t have an ati gpu don t install the nvidia drivers if you don t have an nvidia gpu etc

605956
disk	ram
despite high speeds for reading ram and writing to disk even with a defragmented hibernation file on a big empty drive it still takes quite a while to write several gigabytes you will notice that hibernating and resuming a system with small amounts of ram is farily fast

605956
disk	ram
the screen goes off quickly but the drive and motherboard fans etc. all remain running for a while until it finishes flushing the ram to disk

605995
disk	ram
do we pull everything that was in ram before hibernation back from the disk into ram all at once or only a little bit at a time as needed

605995
disk	ram
so we might expect that writing information from ram to disk on hibernate would take about the same time as reading that same ram from disk resume from hibernate

width	height
if you are developing in some gui framework there are always hardcoded methods to obtain native width and height of the screen

606209
width	height
if you were to use it would scale the video watermark in this case to a width of 25 and scale the height down such that the aspect ratio stays the same you can also use

most modern linux distributions including ubuntu are distributed as a live cd which means you can boot from the cd directly and try the operating syustem without making any changes to your hard drive

606809
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
in my experience linux mint which is based on ubuntu is better at recognizing and configuring laptop hardware

606811

606974
factors	mean
the official user manual advertises the bus transfer rate for the pci-express slots as 5 gb s lane direction raw bandwidth . what does this mean practically and does it affect the maximum bit factors 192 256 etc. that a supported graphics card can use

your mouse doesn t have keys but your keyboard does

607114
mouse	keyboard
your mouse wishes it did but back to being serious if your mouse had the keys a keyboard did it would cause undue strain to the joints of your fingers which are so crucial

607114
mouse	keyboard
i wouldn t necessarily want to be moving around class diagrams with my keyboard. we spend so much time on the keyboard creating content and we become such excellent typists that it frustrates us to take the time to reach for the mouse perform some menial task with it and move back to the keyboard to get the real work done

width	height
there is a screen wide blue banner at the top about 150px in height but the content is still within a 960 width centralized again

607274
portrait	landscape
then i have one page that needs to be in landscape and then again the portrait orientation of pages go

607277
cpu	processors
so a cpu with two physical cores that are hyper-threaded like the i3 will report the two physical processors and the two logical processors to the os making it appear as if the computer has 4 processors so that the os can properly distribute the task load s amongst the processors it sees

607281
subnet	vlan
in other words if a computer with internet access gets hacked will it being on one side of a vlan help prevent the hacker from accessing the other subnet

607401
ubuntu	linux
for ubuntu and arch linux just use the package management tools apt-get install zathura or pacman -s zathura to install

607407
chown	chmod	chown	mount
the share mount and works fine except for chown chmod commands which fail with

607407
chown	chmod
there are some pre-existing scripts and utilities i need to use which fail because of the non-zero exit status returned by chown chmod

607407
chown	chmod	chown	mount
note the only solution i m looking for here is some way to configure the server mount so that chmod chown will fail quietly - return zero exit status

607411
chown	chmod
well the trivial answer is to preempt the real chmod and chown with other programs

607411
chown	chmod
that you have full access to create scripts called chmod and chown that say just

607411
chown	chmod
if you want to be able to chmod and chown when you can make the scripts say

607411
chown	chmod
replacing bin with the directory that the real chmod and chown are in.â

607411
chown	chmod
as long as the real chmod and chown commands are in the same directory on your system

607429
rpm	yum
it does seem to have wget and rpm but it doesn t have make so i ran into a wall when trying to install yum after grabbing it with wget

put	get
once you have done that to get the view which does stay put when you scroll through the document

607496
chown	chmod
read up on chmod and chown

607522
chown	chmod
chown ing and chmod ing the file didn t help either.

607552
packets	multicast
as spiff said to send packets on a multicast address you can use the ping command but if you want to use it for an application purpose prefer to use private multicast addresses in the range of 239.255.x.y instead of to use standard multicast addresses 224.x.y.z

607557
ubuntu	debian
if your os is debian based ubuntu debian execute the following command

607566
disk	ram
with a top-notch cpu and video card installed and reasonably fast ram the hard disk is now the main bottleneck in the system

607574
google-chrome	firefox
i d like to know if there is a google-chrome or firefox plugin extension etc

607585
ssd	sata
i would suggest use a normal sata ssd for your os then load all your games applications and intensive stuff onto the pciexpress card

607589
google-chrome	firefox
i am using kaspersky internet security 2013 and added firefox and google-chrome to a trusted applications

607762
google-chrome	firefox
sometimes i would rather prefer starting a browser session in firefox but the fact that all my data isn t there makes me go back to google-chrome

607762
google-chrome	firefox
i figured since these are the two most popular browsers in use there must exist some hidden feature or extension that would allow firefox to sync data with google-chrome either directly or via my google account and vice-versa

607762
google-chrome	firefox
is there a solution to sync my data between google-chrome and firefox

607771
rpm	yum

607831
freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
there are many to choose from -- haproxy is well loved by linux folks but simple high quality alternatives exist like pen openbsd s relayd or its freebsd port etc

607833
hex	binary
this is not a complete answer because i gather you are supposed to be learning rather than just copying but if you know what the possible hex values are ie not just 0-9 and you know how to represent these in binary ie x2 is equivalent to bin 10 then since you have a one-to-one relationship you could create a table of equivalents and use that to covert one version to the other

607849
multiplying	subtract
the simplest way is just to subtract and multiplying by 24

607855
stdout	stderr
well as documented in wikipedia and netcat documentation there is a -e option that causes it to spawn e xecute a program upon receipt of a connection attaching the socket to stdin stdout and stderr of the process.â example usage

607869
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
amazon offers an email-based service that will convert gif png and bmp graphics to azw. 101 amazon will also convert html pages and microsoft word doc or docx documents through the same email-based mechanism which will send a kindle-formatted file to the device via 3g for 0.15 per mb or via wifi for free from here

607882
rpm	yum
if you actually were in a situation where you had rpm but not yum you should be able to grab the packages here for centos 5.8 you can find others by starting here --or back another directory

607896
disk	ram
â i understand that you donâ t want to write the file to disk in the clear â â but can you decrypt the file and write it to a tmpfs file system ram disk or an encrypted file system

607905
ubuntu	linux
as you are a begginner in linux web servers ubuntu would be ok

607905
ubuntu	debian
to my mind i would prefer debian ubuntu is based on debian well known as stable long term support only and free of any proprietary software or drivers

607914
screens	tablet
it will also automatically make the virtual machine a non-touch screens computer so pen and touch and tablet pc settings will automatically be removed from the windows 8 control panel

udp	tcp
as i control the openvpn server and client i have the option of establishing the openvpn tunnel connection from a to b via udp or tcp

608008
udp	tcp	tunnel	packets
so if im doing tcp http from a to c my thoughts are that i will be best setting the a to b as an openvpn tcp tunnel and let the smaller rtt latency link resolve the packets loss rather than using openvpn udp and then letting the longer higher-level http a-to-c resolve the packets loss

608035
folder	directory
i would maybe suggest to create a vm folder directly in your users nameofyouruser directory rather than in your root directory or an opt or usr or var directory because it will makes the rights and the ownership much easier to manage

608036
emacs	aquamacs
if i use aquamacs emacs a gui emacs for mac then i can at least get the view command to work it opens up the default pdf viewer which is called preview

608036

google-chrome	firefox
i have a freshly installed firefox v 21.0 on my windows7 32 bit machine with the hope that it uses less memory than google-chrome

608193
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox are memory hogs the more extensions installed and tabs you have open and the more complex each page in its respective tab is the more memory you consume

608234
dropbox	skydrive

the only working os i can currently plug the hd in is ubuntu linux

filesystems	ntfs
it seems crazy that ntfs can support file paths up to 32k in length yet so many utilities which aim to audit those filesystems seem unable to cope with such valid filepaths

608793
sctp	tcp
it may be worth making your application fall back to sctp or even tcp

608793
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
i actually found this question because i was looking for how to reject incoming udp packets from users using more than their share of the downlink when it is congested because unlike sctp and tcp udp has no congestion control making it very difficult to prioritise the downlink traffic

608793
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
both sctp and tcp have congestion control and play nicely with qos but sctp has the additional benefit over tcp that it was designed for real-time streaming applications making it a good replacement for both tcp and udp

608813
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
as i understand outgoing packets of any transport protocol can be prioritised but of tcp udp and sctp only tcp and sctp have congestion control allowing their incoming packets to be prioritised as well

608813
sctp	tcp
the congestion control of sctp and tcp that i m referring to is called explicit congestion notification ecn

608813
implements	extends
i ve since realised that it is quite possible that an application ignores or does not properly implements ecn support so i d like to extends this question to anything that fails to respond to ecn which includes udp

i tried running ssh in bash and my wrapper script was invoked so it seems like it s a problem with zsh

that is how i get to use the same keyboard and mouse even if on different computers

what can i add to my .emacs file to set 4 global-key commands to switching between all 4 screens as demonstrated above

609056
debian	linux	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
on debian-based linux the uchardet package debian ubuntu provides a command line tool

609077
bash	zsh
when you started bash it didn t share the zsh internal hash of paths so it just starts looking in the path to find things

609087
disk	ram
the point of using a virtual machine is to present a virtual machine disk cpu ram usb and video to the guest os

609145
cpu	processors
if task manager shows the processors running at it s proper frequency and you can t find any relevant settings in the configuration then you might indeed have damaged your cpu

609214
mouse	keyboard
apparently my keyboard and or mouse were trumping the boot order somehow

609258
put	get
i named the script cachefile.bat and put the script into a folder like userprofile bin which i created and then created a .lnk to that file in the sendto folder to that file which i named cache file to get to the sendto folder easily type shell sendto and hit enter at the start- run prompt or on the explorer address bar

as we know vpn tunnel are encrypted but how well encrypted are they really

609406
tunnel	vpn
yes the isp can see your surfing traffic and dns queries if your vpn is set up as split tunnel where only traffic going to your corporate network goes over the encrypted vpn tunnel and every thing else goes out the regular internet path

scp samplefile arpit windows_host tmp - sends the file to c windows temp

609575

found out that in tmp environment variable is set to c windows temp

609581

it s a bonus if the command finds all bin tmp folder as there may be many in the directory tree

same applies to safari and firefox

third concerning efi and ntfs a mac s efi firmware includes drivers for both fat and hfs+ and it can read boot loaders from either filesystems

609728
mp4	h.264
my recommendation would be to use the mp4 container with the h.264 video codec and aac audio for maximum possibility of hardware acceleration

609732
mouse	keyboard
having already discovered during the ssd upgrade that both my mouse and keyboard could independently cause the hanging issue at start up i set about trying different ports including the two usb 3.0 ports given that there are separate settings for 2.0 and 3.0 ports in the bios i considered that this may offer a solution

609732
mouse	keyboard
while i doubt any changes i made to the 3.0 settings mattered i turned on battery charging i should turn that off... having both my mouse and wireless keyboard dongle plugged into the usb 3.0 ports not the 2.0 ports and then re-enabling usb legacy support has resulted in a solution

609732
mouse	keyboard
it seems whatever was causing the hanging was some combination of usb keyboard and or mouse plugged into usb 2.0 ports while having usb legacy support enabled

609732
mouse	keyboard
when the keyboard and or mouse are plugged into the 3.0 ports while the setting is enabled this issue goes away and both devices can be discoverd and used during boot bios and grub

609769
ethernet	wireless
i just tied the second fork from the splitter to the coax on the router and voilã â â i can get internet from the router thru its wireless and ethernet ports

609807
filesystems	ntfs
now windows probably through a conscious marketing strategical choice has never supported reading or writing from anything other than the native windows filesystems such as vfat and ntfs

609807
filesystems	ntfs
bottom line create a shared data partition using the ntfs filesystems and both linux and windows will happily be able to read and write from to it

609809
wmv	flv
convert the flv to either an mp4 wmv mov or avi with again a reasonable file size

609815
ssd	sata
i ve tried different sata ports and a different brand of ssd drive but still get the same result

609840

this will create an mp4 file containing h.264 video and aac-lc audio

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have a url that i m hitting that works in incognito mode firefox safari and pretty much any other browser other than vanilla google-chrome

609862
rtp	sdp
vlc probably attempts to decode under a few of these codes in order to effortlessly receive some rtp streams such as from a hdhomerun and thus avoiding the requirement of an annoying sdp file

609874
filesystems	ntfs
therefore that is what ntfs and most other filesystems uses as default too

609957
folder	directory
how can i move not copy all the files with the same extension from hundreds of sub directory into a single folder without overwriting same name files

609969

centos	linux	debian	linux	debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
you don t say which linux you use but for centos redhat you need to install the sysstat package and i think it s the same on debian ubuntu

610042

however i ve noticed that when i switch to linux i m currently using opensuse with power management enabled i notice a rapid drain in battery life

610054
wan	lan
now i can access magento over the wan but not the lan

610064
ant	maven
it happens that while the upload is in progress and this is usually done with tools like ant or maven directly from the development environment the application server start deploy to discover later than it is a corrupted zip file because the upload wasn t finished yet

610074
folder	directory
i want to copy selected files in a sub directory from the source folder to a destination folder at the same time preserve the directory structure

610095
rpm	yum
you can probably download the older rpm from that and install it with yum localinstall

610101
post	get
group several post into a email or get one email for one post

610120
folder	directory
you can apply this to all folder by selecting all the folder in the c directory and doing the properties- customise- what type of folder do you want thing

610120

if you create a new folder in the c directory you ll have to do it again for the new folder

610178
wan	lan
be sure to use the wan interface on the belkin to connect to your modem and the lan interface on the netgear to connect to your belkin

610188
folder	directory
and even if you just simply look at the src folder using the subdomain you can see that all the files are in the directory

610193
folder	directory
other wise it will autocomplete to documents folder or any file in the current directory

610205
disk	ram
ultrasawblade brings up a good point about the use of ram disk to keep files from ever being written to disk for security reasons and this post does not apply to those situations.

610205
disk	ram
there is absolutely no need for a ram disk in windows 7 and very little need in windows xp vista these don t have superfetch which pre-fetches data but they do have disk caching

610205
disk	ram
the only benefit to a ram disk is that you get to choose which files are loaded ahead of time

610205
disk	ram
this is what is most frequently deceiving about ram disk being faster

610205
disk	ram
loading all of office onto a ram disk wastes a lot of memory there are many files which are installed with office but which are never used in normal use templates help files themes other than the default etc.

610205
disk	ram
with a ram disk there s no way to cache something like the windows event log or the master ntfs file table

610205

i honestly wish you could just so that i could show people what it s like if they replace their disk cache with a ram disk

disk	ram
ram disk will speed up file access

610213
disk	ram
note that ram disk are volatile and you would have to recopy files each boot

610213
disk	ram
trying to do this yourself with a ram disk may not result in much improvement unless you a have a specific program that reads and writes a file repeatedly b have no need for this file to exist on disk and c the program cannot be reconfigured in any other way

610213
disk	ram
note that having a ram disk reduces your available ram to the system and other programs so you might be robbing peter to pay paul with your ram

610213
disk	ram
one good use of ram disk is to tell a program to write there in order to ensure that the data never touches a disk

610213
disk	ram
setting a program to use a temp directory on a ram drive keeps that data off of a disk if security or privacy are extreme concerns

610218
disk	ram
the best use of a ram disk is to hold files that are frequently accessed - especially writing

610218
disk	ram
applications like visual studio adobe creative suites temp file location and games can benefit greatly from ram disk

610218
disk	ram
as for superfetch it is not a replacement for a ram disk

610218
disk	ram
a ram disk will never miss a file since all the files are copied to ram

610238
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse are both ps 2

610264

this is fine on a normal pc however on a tablet device users are still able to swipe from the side of the screens to access the start menu

610274
mp3	flac
we use mp3 and not a lossless format flac since google music transcodes flac to 320kbps mp3s anyway

it works nicely from lan but not wan

but windows 64bit always runs ie 64bit frame even though i run it from under the program files x86 folder

610407
cat	tee
cat foo.txt | tee dev tty | less works even better than that but when i use it as a pager in mysql it tends to cut off short of printing the whole result table

610423
dropbox	skydrive
i ve seen some similar questions but these are dealing with files under 1gb and the answers generally recommend services such as dropbox s3 and skydrive

610433
notepad++	sublimetext
my personal favorite is sublimetext 2 as it s cross-platform and many people like notepad++ which is only available for windows

610438

flashphoner is wowza media server plugin module that enables to make sip call using client-side or server-side api and share incoming sip to wowza audio stream between unlimited number of flash clients connected to wowza media server

610471
disk	ram
mac os x has the ability to use secure virtual memory meaning that anything from ram that is swapped out to disk is encrypted

610486
ubuntu	linux
this is compared to a ubuntu linux server that rebooted in under 1 minute

610499

all users have encrypted home folder on one server i maintain and one of the users non-human account has useful resources in its home directory shared via apache

cpu	affinity
a sound card has its own controller cpu so you can not add power or adjust affinity to that controller from your cpu

macports and homebrew are much better osx specific alternatives

all traffic continues to route over the vpn tunnel

all i needed was a good explanation of dmz

610602
dmz	was
enter your router s config page mine was 192.168.0.1 and configure it to dmz the internal ip of the server

610602
wan	lan
configure your modem s firewall to accept packets from wan to lan

610613
bluetooth	usb
however it appears that there are a number of bluetooth 4.0 usb dongles on the market with aptx support and of course their hardware-specific drivers

610621

to be precise i m using ubuntu 12.04 and the old way still works but is deprecated and no longer works on debian or newer ubuntu

with linux the file location for the bootloader is boot depending on how you installed it the boot could be on the ubuntu partition or on it s own partition

610712

this means that unless the permissions have been altered for the directory only root can create new files folder within

you can likely pull this off with little to no issue with linux ubuntu as long as both systems have hardware supported especially if the hard drive interface is the same on both systems sata most likely

on my machine linux mint x64 intentionally zero swap programs like firefox and google-chrome running at the same time because then need to unfortunately end up consuming a lot more memory than they have any reason to

610839
google-chrome	firefox
i m sick and tired of programs like google-chrome and firefox screwing me because they just randomly from a user perspective decide hey i need more memory

610839
google-chrome	firefox
best i can find so far is to isolate google-chrome and firefox individually to vms on some other machine with locked-in maximum memory footprints

610839
google-chrome	firefox
while this question could be limited to just google-chrome or firefox i m sure there are other highly wasteful programs that need some kind of restraint

610839
google-chrome	firefox
so while a solution that fixes firefox and google-chrome bad behavior may do what i need a more general solution is really what i m wanting

610855
move	drag
on my laptop i use at work whenever you drag a window so that a portion of it is off-screen and then move the mouse towards the direction it is cut off in it will begin to proportionately slide the window back onto the screen until it is entirely in view

macports	homebrew
since then i haven t been able to access many important services including homebrew and macports since obviously the variable has been changed

610879
stdout	stderr
because redirects only stdout and errors are written to stderr you need to use one of the following instead

610879
stdout	stderr
is a bash extension which redirects both stdout and stderr to a file

610879
stdout	stderr
otherwise the easiest approach is to first redirect stdout and then make stderr fd 2 a copy of the already-redirected file handle on stdout fd 1 like so

610880
stdout	stderr
when you compile a program with gcc there are different kinds of output to stdout and stderr

610880
stdout	stderr
and send stderr 2 to the same place as stdout the same place as stdout

610881
stdout	stderr
however since the pipe only captures stdout the decrypt command can send its errors to stderr where they ll be displayed on the console

610881
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout and stderr either together or independently

610881
stdout	stderr
you can also use a shorthand notation to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file

610925

rss	feed
i did briefly try several ipad and android apps that render your rss feed in a newspaper style but i gave up using them due to one major flaw with this concept - the length and format of articles is inconsistent and it destroys layout and feel you end up just reading poorly formatted websites crammed in tiny columns where all the images are stripped out

610997
rss	feed
or the rss feed is the same as the content on the original website and so you end up with massive rss articles that could run to many pages in a pdf

611000
rss	feed
it s mostly a good enough replacement and i can at least go back to reading rss feed in my web browser at work

611011
tunnel	vpn
the only way to do this is afaik to run your vpn and the programs you want to tunnel inside a vm

611027
google-chrome	safari
doesn t matter whether i use google-chrome or safari bot in bot cases when i click on the new tab i see the rolling colourful circle and in 2-4 seconds is displayed the new tab and i can type an url address

611080
ubuntu	mint
i use mint rather than ubuntu but a tool like gparted should allow you to do this

611107
jobs	cron
i have set up cron jobs which stop services at 2 00 am and then restarts them at 8 00 am

611107
jobs	cron
the best solution i was able to come up with was to modify the start stop scripts to examine the time as a condition or to have the cron jobs place a flag file on disk that the services start jobs look for prior to allowing startup

611130
chown	chmod
use chown and or chmod to manipulate the properties of the-unmovable-unrenamable-protected-dir

611136
mouse	keyboard
i am trying to map a mouse button to mimic a single press of a ctrl key on the keyboard

611146
margin	height
the only way i could change the height was to drag the bottom margin up on the left hand side

611161
ubuntu	linux
except is is happening in both windows 7 and linux ubuntu 12 04tls fully patched multiple mice multiple oss

611161
mouse	keyboard
i ve stripped it down to just the keyboard and mouse different keyboard too just in case the keyboard was the problem but it s still happening

611161
mouse	keyboard
i have literally pulled the mouse and keyboard out and plugged them into another computer laptop and re-joined the online game and had no problem with the keyboard and mouse combo that just failed on my gaming rig

611173
ethernet	wireless
my second solution is to plug in the ethernet cord right in your laptop and if the speed is the same than take it back to the store if the speed is fast like your other computers then update your wireless drivers

611181
udp	tcp
another possibility could be to abandon tcp altogether and use an udp based protocol for example udt or uftp

611181
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
it goes without saying that the ping functionality must be verified on the router - if the router doesn t answer pings or drops icmp when under tcp udp load because of protocol prioritization then the second version of the script could do far more harm than good

611182
jobs	cron
i then modified the cron jobs to use the newly created batch files and it appears to be working

611199
move	drag
i can move the mouse and drag vertical lines from the edges of the screen

611208
udp	tcp
successfully blocking a port range in windows firewall means creating 4 rules tcp incoming udp incoming tcp outgoing and udp outgoing

611259
mouse	keyboard
both types of sessions occasionally hang for a couple of seconds don t react to mouse and or keyboard and also don t update their displayed content

611323
vpn	lan
then if your lan s dns servers are accessible via the vpn you need to configure your vpn software to tell windows to set the vpn connection s dns servers to those

611324
versioning	upgrade
unfortunately i upgrade and use ubuntu 13.04 and it seems that almost all solutions do not work in this versioning

611337
ubuntu	debian
if i download iso from debian site and then create a cd can i still do the similar installation as i did with the ubuntu

611360
powerpc	i386
linux with kernel 2.6.16 glibs 2.4 or newer on arm powerpc i386 x86_64

611363
mouse	keyboard
there s not much to go on from the question but you can for example try using both the mouse and the keyboard to scroll up and down

611395
sudoers	visudo
this access is also logged and you can manage the access lists with the etc sudoers file use the command visudo to actually edit it don t edit it directly

611397
pop-up	dialog
this was solved by a don t show dialog from this site anymore checkbox but chrome-managed pop-up are even better for the second reason with such pop-up you can still switch to another tab and when you re back to the first one the pop-up will still be there

611397
pop-up	dialog
i think guys behind chrome have realized that making it look like a dialog is a poor design concept because in chrome 29 currently in dev channel those pop-up look like this

611398
g++	gcc
you will need to have a few dev dependencies available like gcc g++ and more but the build scripts will check for env sanity and let you know if you re missing anything

611399
tiff	png	gif	png
formats--jpeg png gif tiff and others--but not high-resolution raw

611401
ubuntu	debian
the ability to install as a windows program is achieved through a program called wubi which is ubuntu specific so no you will not be able to install debian that way

611401
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
in my experience ubuntu is better than debian at recognizing wireless cards and linux mint is better than ubuntu

611401
debian	linux
also debian while it is my personal favorite distribution is not the best place to start learning linux

611401
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
ubuntu or mint are much easier to install and set up for a linux newcomer

611401
ubuntu	mint
both distributions can be installed within windows use wubi howto for ubuntu and mint4win howto for mint

611404
antivirus	mcafee
i have mcafee total protection antivirus installed on my computer and would like to commit an update through command line

611427

a vpn only creates a tunnel between your computer and the end point of the vpn

611449
mouse	joystick
powered input items joystick mouse things

611451
norton	mcafee
uninstall everything to do with mcafee and norton

611474
cpu	processors
you might as well be running an intel atom z510 -- your cpu is 10 times faster than the super-lightweight atom processors

611498
debian	linux
i want to do it running tails linux distro based on tor and debian and i have the following problems

611518
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome for personal stuff firefox for impersonal stuff and ie for work related stuff

611518
google-chrome	firefox
i had thought it was only google-chrome until i realized it was occurring in firefox also

611518
google-chrome	firefox
this post seems relevant google-chrome not loading web pages correctly unless multiple refreshes but this doesn t seem to say anything with regards to firefox or ie

611529
wan	lan
your inclination is likely correct upgrading your lan hardware probably won t make much of a difference if your clients are connecting from the wan

611555
tunnel	vpn
an ipsec vpn tunnel is usually faster than an ssl tunnel

611603
debian	linux
i m new to linux and studying it on debian

611609
xfce	gnome
in that case to get the same effect on xfce you might try these instructions from archlinux on using gnome keyring without gnome

611621
post	get
if i connect it to the motherboard s dvi connector the screen does not display any image on post nor when i m actually in my os if i move the connector to the gtx card i get an image however

611647
google-chrome	firefox
and when it fails it s all domains that are down in all browsers google-chrome firefox etc

611673
put	get
if you can live without an optical drive in your new machine then you can get an adapter to allow you to put a sata drive in the optical bay replacing the optical drive there

611786

611802
filesystems	ntfs
the type of the filesystems is ntfs

611843
filtering	grouping
if you want it to only list the grouping you can use find to filtering it

611863
disk	ram
as far as your documents are concerned they were stored in the current session in ram so it will not matter if the files on the disk have changed- the hiberfile will still have a copy of the files as you left them

611885
bash	zsh
the suggestion regarding zsh was good but if you want to do something for bash you might need to script that yourself

611890
filesystems	ntfs
since no one mentioned any specific filesystems more modern filesystems ext3 ext4 ntfs are able to handle crashes much better than older filesystems ext2 ext fat32 due to journaling

611900
cpu	hyperthreading
if i buy 2 six core cpu and my licence is for 10 cpu i believe that my application will be running faster than if hyperthreading was enabled in the bios because i will then end up with 24 cpu on the box but will only use 10 therefore by disabling hyperthreading each cpu will be faster

611913
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is a bit weird when estimating performance because 12 threads isn t using half the cpu - it s using the whole cpu

611913
disk	ram
the benefit with them is that the cpu can do other things while the first 12 are waiting on data to be returned from the disk or from ram

611919
google-chrome	firefox
i was looking over google-chrome and the task manager feature and really wishing something like this was in firefox as i have lots of addons probably too many and lots of tabs open

611919
google-chrome	firefox
anyone know of something like google-chrome s task manager but for firefox

611927
ffmpeg	libav
also see who can tell me the difference and relation between ffmpeg libav and avconv

611938
screens	tablet
if you fold the screens all the way down into tablet mode you see another notification auto-rotate lock off and you re now able to rotate it 90 degrees etc

611938
screens	tablet
screws up the display it s pretty easy during transition from tablet mode to end up with the auto-rotate lock on notification coming up while the screens is rotated oddly - for example 90 degrees

611947
mouse	keyboard
is there a keyboard shortcut that will toggle between the comment bubbles and the main document so that i can add comments without using the mouse

611971
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and apache all support sni name-based virtual hosts over ssl fully on windows xp and newer

611980
vmware	virtualbox
i don t like virtualbox or vmware

611994
wan	lan
you re correct about the remote management functionality - the linksys expects it from the wan not the lan

612013
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i know firefox doesn t have any built-in way to show the other details that google-chrome s task manager does like cpu and network usage

612026

opera	firefox
my question is how does my computer know whether to display the received web page in my open opera window or my open firefox window or my other open firefox window or heck to open a new browser instance

612143
folder	directory
drive directly on the drive not inside any directory folder

612152
filesystems	hfs+
a cursory google tells me that osx uses the hfs+ filesystems which there are certainly no free windows utilities to format a drive into

612152
filesystems	hfs+
is a trialware program that claims to be able to format for mac which may be the hfs+ filesystems you need

612152
hfs+	ntfs
otherwise i suggest creating a livedisc of partedmagic or a similar linux distribution and using it to format the drive since the simple fact is that windows won t touch hfs+ and macs won t touch ntfs

612163
zmodem	telnet	xmodem	zmodem
depending on your telnet client - if you have one which supports x y zmodem emulation might be to use one of the old file transfer protocols like xmodem or zmodem

612166
folder	directory
your batch file can change directory to target and call your script from that folder with full path

cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	processors	hyperthreading
since hyperthreading allows for unused cpu time to be used by other processes why would this make it seem like 4 logical processors 2 per actual core

612482

if the logical cores core0 core1 core2 and core3 are all at 100 then your cpu is actually running at about 115 of it s total without hyperthreading

612506
mouse	keyboard
if you have any friends you can borrow a mouse and keyboard to perform the initial centos installation and then use the same basic instructions i gave you a link to to install and setup vnc and then return the keyboard and mouse to your friend

612506
mouse	keyboard
if you want to head to your nearest salvation army or goodwill store you could purchase a keyboard and a mouse for less than 10 usd and then use them to install and set up centos

612506
mouse	keyboard
you can still install vnc and put the keyboard and mouse away for future use

612506

personally i recommend getting the keyboard and mouse and having them should anything go wrong in the future

disk	ram
likely what you are observing are the disk caching features of windows 7 they actually optimize the ram usage even though it appears as though the opposite is happening

612907
put	get
unfortunately the same thing that broke your original ram probably also affected your new ram so when you try to put it back in you get the same symptoms

612915
disk	ram
if no program is using it it ll store as much information from your hd as possible so that when a program requests some information it ll be available in ram that is much faster then your disk

if the program runs again soon keeping it in ram is a huge win -- disk i o is avoided

i m wondering if it s possible to switch the emacs keybindings to vim keybindings for those gui-level input areas

613317
vim	emacs
i m thinking--and i may well be wrong here--that since os x already ships with vim installed there should be a way to change a preference file deep in the system that maps vim instead of emacs keybindings to the gui text input areas

mouse	trackpad
3.click the mouse trackpad pane

613605
mouse	trackpad
3.click the mouse trackpad pane

613630
folder	directory
i am assuming although i have not tried it that it is possible to use subst to mount an existing empty created for this purpose folder as drive q and then mklink j to create a directory symbolic link from q somedir to wherever i want

613645
mouse	keyboard
however whenever i try to open one of the menu options file edit etc. the mouse pointer changes into a cross and nothing happens i can t open the menu with the keyboard shortcuts as well

613678
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r username group usr local etc openssl

613679

613728
post	get
in order to get to or past post you need the following items

613728
post	get
without those 4 or 5 things you will get just a black screen you can ignore 4 if you wish but it will over heat quickly and get you back to not being able to post till it cools down

613730
screens	tablet
alternatively another way i would like to have implemented would be to touch the windows icon on the tablet screens outside of the viewing area and touch an app to launch the mobility center

613736
ethernet	wireless
is there any way i can get to the wireless network internet through the first computer that is on the wireless network and has an available ethernet port

613755
uninstall	downgrade
the internet is full of vague information about how you can downgrade the windows 8.1 preview to windows 8 and i kind of want to try it but only if it s not going to be too inconvenient to uninstall if i need to

613758
wan	lan
there is a big difference between lan and wan

613772
antivirus	mcafee
windows firewall don t block dhcp by default but as you re using mcafee antivirus it includes a firewall which can be configured by your organization admins to block dhcp or can just be broken

613772
antivirus	mcafee
so you can leave mcafee antivirus running but turn off its firewall if your org admins allow

613840
dropbox	skydrive
download and install skydrive or dropbox

613855
cpu	processors
once the data leaves the hard drive for the rest of the system the processors whether it s a dedicated controller or the cpu needs to process the data and decide what s happening with it

613869
filesystems	ntfs
when copying large files or testing writespeed with dd the max writespeed i can get is about 12-15mb s on drives using the ntfs filesystems

613882
google-chrome	firefox
you can write your own scripts for greasemonkey firefox or tampermonkey google-chrome

613884
filesystems	ntfs
when you format the drive it clears all the data off it and puts in a state of unpartitioned no filesystems followed by being set to whatever filesystems is used chosen by you or the os for windows that would be ntfs

613886
installation	downgrade
i want to downgrade to windows 7 pro and i want a clean installation

613888
ubuntu	debian
if you are a debian ubuntu user for installation you can simply do

613907
mouse	keyboard
alternatively i could run an executable or bat file when idle and this executable could wait for mouse keyboard action before it runs a script to kill the minirosetta tasks

613928
folder	directory
give this directory a name this will be the folder you will put after h p yourmachine folder where folder virtual directory alias

613938
mouse	keyboard
i m assuming when you return after leaving the pc idle for a while you find the screensaver running and dismiss it using the mouse or keyboard

613943
google-chrome	firefox
this is very possibly related to a process that repeatedly runs at or near 100 cpu-time quite possible firefox google-chrome or another browser

613946
ubuntu	debian
the default setting in debian ubuntu is on demand which is the best setting for personal use

613951
hide	show
in settings- desktop there are only options to show hide the home folder trash etc but no option to hide the contents of the desktop folder

613953

614009
ethernet	wireless
my set up is as follows isp --- cable modem --- ethernet switch --- netbook server firewall wifi --- wireless connected devices

614016
versioning	upgrade
i think i read somewhere that the windows 7 upgrade eula does not prohibit the use of a windows 7 evaluation versioning being the previous versioning of windows that you are upgrading from

614016
versioning	upgrade
but i don t buy upgrade versioning of windows so i haven t checked that eula

614079
vpn	lan
without the vpn connected i could only connect to the lan and had no internet access

614079
vpn	lan
i can easily set it up to block all non-vpn traffic but can t work out how to that and still allow all lan traffic whether the vpn is connected or not

614081
opera	firefox
i would suggest configuring and using opera and firefox and reinstalling older and or newer versions of the other browsers

614088
redhat	fedora
in my lan network i have a server with scientific linux redhat or fedora based distro i ve done yum install nginx but the welcome page is not accessible from other computers in my network

basecamp	harvest
i ve looked at a few task management apps like basecamp and harvest but nothing appears to let me edit my calendar natively and then sync with a 3rd party

614097
width	height
bonus question what are par width and height

614110
width	height
simply enter your desired width and height or choose one parameter and tick the keep aspect ratio checkbox to have the other one filled out for you automatically

614110
width	height
of course if you set width and height with the wrong aspect ratio you will squish or stretch the picture

614110
width	height
loose where you can set the width of the output and the video will be scaled down and encoded with width and height divisible by 16 or any other if you set the modulus option

614110
width	height
for example to get your video to a height of 480 pixels you d have to use a width of 853

614110
width	height
but this is a problem the encoder can only create video with height and width divisible by 2

614152
vlookup	sumifs
i m suggesting using both sumifs and vlookup

614156
ethernet	wireless
i have two working network connections one connection is for a wired ethernet card adapter and the other is for a wireless usb adapter

614167
vlookup	sumifs
if there concatenate of id+effective date is unique sumifs can be used instead of vlookup here since we re dealing with numbers

614201
google-chrome	firefox
i looked around for a way to see the ie download history and some people indicated that ie doesnâ t have a dedicated history for downloads like firefox and google-chrome do but i still need a way of getting that information

614213
centos	linux
the linux box is running centos 6 mac is mountain lion

614227
bash	subshell
a bash possibility similar to nerdwaller s solution but without subshell and forks to awk

614229

you don t want a keyboard or mouse connected

614304
width	height
i could swear that windows xp used to show the width and height of images in explorer if i toggle the dimensions column but now it is showing nothing see screenshot below

614312
filesystems	fat
flash-memory has limited write cycles and part of the filesystems especially the fat which is often modified yet stored in a static location on the disk could have had sufficient changes that the sectors it was stored on were worn out

614321
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the resize property is supported in firefox 4+ google-chrome and safari

614327
udp	tcp
look here for simple tcp proxy or simple udp proxy

614347
ubuntu	linux
reinstall latest linux kernel on ubuntu 10.04

614352
stdout	stderr
how about with a redirection of stderr to stdout

614374
filesystems	hfs
assuming that your filesystems is hfs or similar to other unix filesystems what you want to do is reset the permissions so that they are accessible

614405
mouse	keyboard
you can use something like ghostmouse or remouse to record your mouse and keyboard movements

614411
bitblt	gdi
under windows xp many gdi gdi+ operations are hardware accelerated such as bitblt filling in shapes drawing text etc - however windows vista removed most acceleration windows 7 brought some acceleration back but not as much as xp s had - however this setting is i don t believe controlled by the system control panel

614495
ubuntu	linux
dev sda contains a linux swap partition and a partition that has the ubuntu installation on it

614505

as the title says i m looking for a way in ubuntu linux to compress encrypt split and upload data for backups across multiple clouds

614505
dropbox	skydrive
some of these accounts include dropbox box.net microsoft skydrive google drive and others

614508
rar	zip
now every folder will be created into new rar or zip archive

614572
lvm	mdadm
this wrongly auto-detected raid set-up was created using mdadm --assemble --scan and now several raid or lvm - i don t know devices appear

614660
versioning	upgrade
my question is what is windows 8 loader and how do i upgrade to windows 8 professional versioning

614663
notepad++	textpad
all text editors i know notepad++ textpad etc respect the file format of a file

614674
switching	screens
switching to a different terminal via ctrl + f1 to f6 in text mode or opening a new window in screens via ctrl + a c after having pressed either ctrl + z or ctrl + c will cause the original terminal to skip trying to do all the linefeeds and directly jump to the last line of output in a shorter time

614687
folder	dir
type dir to view the files in the folder and ensure all

614755
vim	gedit
i assume that conversion was successful because when i open windows-1250 version with vim or gedit i saw strange characters after conversion to utf-8 subtitles looks ok so it seems that that from to format was chosen correctly

614769
debian	linux
freenas at least the one i ve got remote access to appears to be a debian box running samba which means that it is doing windows filesharing in linux

614772
post	get
i noticed when publish a post i get a url like this

614772
post	get
but when i use blog engines post area i get a url like this

614795
wan	subnet
you needed to point router a that the upstream wan .1.x subnet ip address of router b

614796
wan	lan
the wan interface on router b needs to be in the range of the lan interface on a eg 192.168.1.253 and needs to be static

614810
xfce	gnome
on my ubuntu client using xfce i am using gnome services

614812

614856
google-chrome	safari
the problem occurs on both safari and google-chrome

614883
ethernet	wireless
i think some wireless to ethernet converter required in between

614905
ubuntu	linux
i ve got a pc running linux ubuntu in case it makes any difference

614952
vpn	lan
ensure your lan is set as a home network and your vpn is set as public

614952
vpn	lan
this allows the vpn to connect through the lan but nothing else

614954
udp	tcp
is it udp or tcp or both

614974
gentoo	debian
it seems there is nothing like gentoo prefix from debian

614976
hide	show
go to folder options in the control panel then view and activate things like show hidden files and disable hide protected operating system files

614995
stdout	stderr
why does the output of some linux programs go to neither stdout nor stderr

614998
stdout	stderr
why does the output of some linux programs go to neither stdout nor stderr

614998
stdout	stderr
is it does the output goes to stdout or stderr

615002
folder	directory
i am simply trying to copy a folder and rename it in the same directory

615004
folder	dir
create folder in your current dir that you want to rename

615004
ubuntu	linux
this works on my linux ubuntu box mac should have wget but wput you might need to install

615012
stdout	stderr
instead you want to redirect stderr and stdout

615023
rpm	yum
my procedure was uncompress the tar.gz file enter in the folder and then makes rpmbuild -ba ganglia.spec a warning message is given saying about the dependencies libraries missing then i install them via yum then gives the rpmbuild again which generates some .rpm files at usr src rpm i did this in a centos 5 and centos 6

615028
kde	kubuntu
i created a new account in kde running kubuntu 13.04 and set the locale to us english

615030
opera	google-chrome
i found this method of managing custom search engines for google-chrome but it doesn t work for opera 15 or higher versions

615031
bluetooth	usb
usb wireless bluetooth ps2 at etc it doesnt matter

615038
x86	64bit
architecture usually means just 32-bit or 64bit x86 but there are also arm powerpc and other architectures

615054
opera	google-chrome
embedding your custom search engines in the web data file usually found in c users #username# appdata roaming opera software opera you can edit the sqlite3 format which is shared by opera in 2 easy ways either install google-chrome create your custom searches and copy the web data file over to opera

615063
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this is happening on os x 10.8 in both google-chrome firefox and safari

615072
installation	upgrade
but again the new installation has the same identical problems of the upgrade i tried to remove install everything tree times

615092
stdout	stderr
your particular question about time builtin has been answered but there are some commands that don t write either to stdout or to stderr

615092
stdout	stderr
also it s better to prompt to dev tty instead of writing to stderr so that if a user redirects stdout and stderr the prompt is still seen

615095
versioning	upgrade
microsoft does not sell digital versioning of windows 8 professional system builder which is what you need the only digital versioning of windows 8 is upgrade license for windows 8

615111
daemons	systemd
even if you were somehow able to get a partial list of the original owners for each object it would almost certainly be incomplete and would reflect a stock systemd state which may have been changed by app daemons install after the files were initially created

615132
capitalization	uppercase
if not many entries already have been made with lower case letters and it looks bad that the entries are the same except for their capitalization so is there a way all the rest could be made all uppercase

615164
filesystems	ntfs
so you have a gpt partition table and one of those partitions doesn t contain a filesystems like ntfs but rather it contains an mbr partition table with a partition for ntfs

615189
mouse	keyboard
i have a full-size keyboard and my favourite mouse on the desk with my pc plus a usb wireless mini keyboard+mousepad gizmo that i only use to watch movies i normally only use the space pause key on the gizmo

615201
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i ve experienced this from windows 8 ubuntu and linux mint so i don t think it s related to the os

615225
udp	tcp
i made sure that i block all tcp and udp from external access and this thing is still transmitting udp packets

615231
udp	tcp
if you really blocked all tcp and udp then web access shouldn t work

615258
ubuntu	linux
is there tool with similar capabilities on ubuntu linux

615262
folder	directory
when i attempt to navigate through the directory structure of the ssd that contains the vm image i am currently running the files and folder appear slowly

615288
ubuntu	debian
i m new to debian 7.x i m trying to connect to server using the old utility available in ubuntu connect to server in the menu

615293
opera	firefox
note it fixed the app in both firefox and opera

615327
macports	homebrew
nice thing about tmux compared to screen is that the vertical split feature comes even with the version you can get from packages macports or homebrew for mac apt-get for ubuntu etc.

615331
ethernet	wireless
if you have the ability to use a wired ethernet backhaul between the aps that would be best because it saves wireless bandwidth for mobile devices that really need it

615333
macbook	bootcamp
i just installed windows 7 on my macbook pro via bootcamp

615373
disk	ram
often when task manager is sluggish it is because the system is low on available ram and task manager has been swapped out of memory and on to disk because you weren t using it or the disk is so busy with its swap file or other things that reading the taskmgr.exe or cmd.exe or taskkill.exe file from the disk takes ages

615401
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade the php versioning from 5.3.3 to 5.4.4 by using

615420
tunnel	lan
bcz what undergoes is when you access internet through a pc which is configured with a private ip local lan ip it uses tunnel concept to get access to the internet through one common public ip but to get access from internet to your pc you need to establish reverse tunnel which in turn uses port forwarding feature

615429
folder	directory
so my question is how to put ubuntu or other operation system into a standalone folder and configure syslinux properly to set directory where ubuntu or other os is as root directory so that i could boot the os successfully

615449
switching	screens
i can t find switching user link on windows login screens to use his administrator account

615459
folder	directory
how do i move the install from the external hard drive into my applications folder i ve tried relocating the directory but i suspect that apps are actually installed elsewhere and shortcuts are created to the app within the applications folder

615468
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu livecd or other linux livecd

615513
debian	linux	debian	mint
in linux mint 15 the etc init.d readme is copied from debian and says to use update-rc.d to manage scripts

615515
mouse	keyboard
as i don t want to add another monitor keyboard and mouse to my desktop i want to control the mac via vnc like i already did it years ago

615524
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
linux mint 15 should be using upstart like ubuntu

615537
umask	mount	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs
this depends on the filesystems used though according to man mount the umask or equivalent option is available for fat hfs hpfs ntfs and udf

615543
bluetooth	usb
i m installing bluetooth on this laptop because it has a fried usb controller and need an external mouse

615575
opensuse	debian
with debian you can use maybe apt-offline or apt-zip but in opensuse

615590
versioning	upgrade
both gmail and yahoo mail fail to download any files due to virus error since i upgrade my laptop to ie10 and the latest versioning of gmail

615590
google-chrome	firefox
ie10 google-chrome and firefox all do the same thing

615683
filesystems	ntfs
but these are still throwing the ntfs filesystems into a fit

615683
vmware	virtualbox
i do have vmware and virtualbox however there s two problems one the image file is just the ntfs partition not including the partition table etc

615702
ubuntu	linux
to install secure deletion package in linux ubuntu install it by the following command

615704
hex	binary
the first 8 ports are in two leftmost hexadecimal values bits ascending from lowest to highest right to left the next 8 ports are in the second two and so on hex f3 24 would be binary 1111 0011 0010 0100 which means that following ports are used 1 2 5 6 7 8 1111 0011 and 11 14 0010 0100

615737
filesystems	ntfs
links and junctions are features of the filesystems built into ntfs

615748
readonly	temporary
these types of problems are often cause by attempting to open the file which downloads them to a temporary folder and the file in question is marked as readonly

615814
processors	hyperthreading
since i have a dual-core processors with hyperthreading available meaning four threads how is it possible to have 1000+ threads when my processors is only supposed to have four

615824
cpu	hyperthreading
at any one time only one thread per virtual because of hyperthreading and similar technologies cpu core can be running that is executing machine code instructions but any number of threads can be runnable meaning that it is a candidate to get the cpu the next time the scheduler needs to make a decision about which thread should be allowed to run

615870
kde	kubuntu
kde plasma ships this feature as default so if you re running kubuntu arch chackra linux or any other distro with kde you already have this feature

615870
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu unity gnome or any other gnu linux desktop environment providing a standard freedesktop.org trash feature you can use autotrash to do this thing

615881
cpu	processors
processors intel r core tm 2 duo cpu e7500 2.93ghz 2933 mhz 2 core s 2 logical processors s

615882
disk	ram
rapidcache provides a ram disk with write-through but is currently in beta

615883
postgresql	mysql
i then restarted and disabled several services like apache2 mysql postgresql ...

615922
ubuntu	linux
i suggest you delete your windows os and either buy windows 7 or windows 8 or if you want a free os go with some linux distribution like ubuntu

615953
subnet	vlan
since there is no difference to put a dot there or not u need to do vlan and subnet to do real network organization

615982
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
is it just google-chrome or firefox opera internet explorer as well

615986
mouse	keyboard
if you install bettertouchtool you can create a keyboard mouse gesture shortcut to either

615999
ubuntu	mint
i have no special sound card with two outputs but have two laptops running ubuntu 12.04 and mint 15 and want to connect the laptops together to play one stream on the first laptop and another stream at second

616022
ethernet	wireless
i have a server with wired and wireless ethernet

616047
cpu	processors
in case you use an intel cpu you may try processors idle state manger

616056
temp	tmp
should i have my windows tmp temp env-var pointing to this partition

616081
temp	tmp
benefits of moving temp and tmp to a different drive will be significant in cases where those directories are heavily used such as an exchange server

616081
temp	tmp
as a best practice it is recommended that the temp and tmp folders be stored on a disk subsystem that is not shared by your system folder or the exchange data files

616081
temp	tmp
the microsoft exchange information store service uses the temp and tmp folders as temporary storage during various operations such as message conversion working with large attachments and mailbox move operations...temp is typically used by applications such as microsoft exchange and tmp is typically used by development tools such as microsoft visual c++

616081
temp	tmp
on windows 7 desktops and laptops with 8 to 16 gb memory and an ssd temp tmp and pagefile are on the same drive

616081
temp	tmp
based on my experiences i recommend using ssd and keeping temp tmp pagefile on the same drive

616081
temp	tmp
on traditional hdds moving pagefile to a different drive on a busy system might help more than moving temp tmp directories

616081
temp	tmp
whether to move temp tmp pagefile to a different drive will depend on how the system is used

616110
temp	tmp
the tmp directory is just as it sounds a temp directory - used for storing things temporarily

616110
matplotlib	scipy
additional functionality like pylab requires numpy scipy and matplotlib

616125
ubuntu	linux
another way to test is to get someone to get you a copy of the ubuntu disk or any linux bootable iso

616126
ethernet	wireless
i set it up like so the wireless internet modem thingy can connect via ethernet as well as usb so i first started by plugging it into the 5th internet port of the wrt54g

616195
sorting	grouping
looks like sorting by the third column will grouping all those rows with values together then you can sort subsequently by any other logic you want

616202
pop-up	dialog
while ambiguous it appears that directory opus 10 does have the functionality to see the full paths of whatever you are moving copying in the dialog pop-up providing of course that you can see it before all files have been moved copied

616202
pop-up	dialog
in the 10.2 highlights video around 12 30 the starting point of this link you can see the complete file path in the copy dialog pop-up

616222
tiff	png
it would also have been important for it to have quite a bit of flexibility - you talk about downloading images but remember that jpegs and png s were not even supported initially and it would probably not have been a leap for the authors to work out newer image formats would be desireable - huge tiff images which from memory were supported were not really a good fit for a heavily shared 9600 baud connection or 14.4k to be generous - which was not uncommon when the protocol was released

616237
google-chrome	firefox
i use visual web developer and some browsers like google-chrome firefox as well as sumatra pdf or vlc

616258
folder	dir
i want to move all the files inside the wordpress folder up into the parent dir which is var www html

irqs cause a cpu core to immediately jump to another place - the irq handler then needs to save the state of the cpu deal with the device such as capture the input and

for example i think the apic can remember if another irq comes in while the cpu is processing one and immediately trigger it on the cpu side right after the cpu tells the apic hey i m done with this irq.

of course if you knew a lot about the internals of the debian or ubuntu installers as well as the boot process of this unit - which could be gleaned through intimate knowledge of how dd-wrt does it you could modify the alternative ubuntu installers or the debian installer to support this unit

619478
wan	subnet

619479
vmware	virtualbox
you may have seen drag-and-drop functionality on virtualbox or vmware before

619481
folder	directory
the issue is folder redirection if a 32 bit program attempts to access the system32 folder it will be invisibly redirected to the windir syswow64 directory this is for 32 64 bit application compatibility

619481
folder	directory
navigate to the hidden folder windir sysnative which will take you to the real system32 folder and you can go up the directory tree like normal

620348
wan	lan

vpn	lan
in the interest of setting up a server in the easiest way possible without running the server software on any computer ie in such a way that i could install a few programs and then leave day-to-day operation to an 11-year-old is it possible to use a vpn to connect two computers such that they would believe that they were on the same network allowing use of minecraft s open to lan feature

the workaround i m using was surprisingly base on truecrypt even though its purpose is not really to encrypt files the reason is that truecrypt lets you create large tc volume files within which it emulates an encrypted version of a native windows ntfs filesystems

623967
google-chrome	firefox
is there a extension in google-chrome or firefox that tell you how much kb has the webpage consumed

623982
folder	directory
another thing to probably increase with that many files is to disable short-naming which will stop windows from creating a second file directory entry which will follow the 8.3 convention ms-dos file-naming convention and decrease the time for folder to enumerate because it doesn t have to look up the short-names associated with their long-names when enumerating

stdout	stderr
terminal io is implemented in terms of these streams stdin coming from the keyboard and stdout stderr going to the terminal and extra effort is required on the part of a process which doesn t wish to make use of those streams or have their file descriptors open

624304
stdout	stderr
any program which wants the equivalent of unix stdin stdout stderr needs a console hence an instance of conhost.exe

i have a version of ffmpeg currently installed but somehow i get a segmentation error on libx264 as well as the libvpx i can t convert to mp4 and webm

624564
width	height
the -1 will tell ffmpeg to automatically choose the correct height in relation to the provided width to preserve the aspect ratio

624564
width	height
-1 can also be used for width if you provide a given height

624564
width	height
one downside of scale when using libx264 is that this encoder requires even values and scale may automatically choose an odd value resulting in an error width or height not divisible by 2

624565
ffmpeg	libvpx
i use this ffmpeg command for webm ffmpeg -i filename.flv -vcodec libvpx -acodec libvorbis filename.webm

ethernet connection we purchased a cable connection and have a wireless router hooked up just for this reason

625114
folder	directory
in the most simple case where your application folder only contains pdf files apart from the directory use this

625145
put	get
if i put something like a asus hd7750-dcsl-1gd5 in those slots what kind of performance might i get relative to the integrate hd4600 graphics on a 4770k or that card running in the pci express 3.0 16 lane slot

someone showed me onetab for google-chrome last night and i decided to start making one for firefox

625277
parallels	bootcamp
i m not familiar enough with mac to know but i would assume this would be handled either by bootcamp which would dual boot both windows and mac on the mac and parallels which virtualizes windows as the mac is booted

625277
parallels	bootcamp
i know parallels is not free. if i went with bootcamp could i migrate his existing windows install to a bootcamp config

625279
vmware	virtualbox
same is true for vm s in virtualbox or vmware fusion too.

625280
ubuntu	linux
dual-booting windows and linux is well-documented as is running one of the bootable oses as a vm inside the other ex dual-boot windows ubuntu

625287

virtual machine monitors vmms like virtualbox vmware workstation player virtual pc etc

625382
debian	linux
it s a linux distro based on debian that runs vms using kvm and openvz

625405
vpn	lan
if eth0 is meant for a dedicated vpn link to a remote vpn network why is it attached to the local lan subnet 10.0.0.x at all

625405
subnet	packets
you outght to use different subnet for eth0 and eth1 otherwise it s very confusing and you re bound to have packets being sent from both interfaces because the host thinks they are on the same subnet

625405
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
your local and remote lan should never be routed to this subnet they will only use this link inside the vpn ed tunnel which will have local private ips 10.0.0.x

625405
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
as long as you have a static route for 212.x.x.x to use eth0 once the vpn link is established all traffic designated for the remote lan will use the tunnel and hence eth0 there s no special routing need to be done as long as the ipsec endpoint exists on the primary router on your lan all necessary routes should be setup for you

omxplayer	mplayer
on my raspberry pi i was trying to get a file to play but both mplayer and omxplayer did not show up in the others list when i tried to associate the file with the players so i typed it in using the custom command line

sudo chown www-data www-data

625648
vmware	virtualbox
if i recalll correctly vmware had a cpu masking feature is there something similar in virtualbox

625786
l2tp	pppoe
but it s also very dependent on your internet connection type direct pppoe pptp l2tp etc

625825
tunnel	vpn
so any traffic you route via gw 10.8.0.5 will enter the vpn tunnel via interface tun0 and exit vpn tunnel at other side of course assuming vpn tunnel is established and working by vpn process running with pid 1307

625825
tunnel	vpn
this means that anything sent to host 10.8.0.1 32 is cidr notation meaning just this one host will be routed via gateway at 10.8.0.5 that is it will enter a vpn tunnel

625825
tunnel	vpn
so when you ping 10.8.0.1 it will work only if vpn tunnel works

625868

width	height
the main_w and main_h parameters take the width and height of the frame so here you re selecting the exact middle point

625887
xfce	kde
i was a kde user too and then i switched to xfce that is quite customizable and pretty light and not too unusual for a kde user

625892
google-chrome	firefox
when i run the website in ie and google-chrome it works beautifully but when i use firefox an error occurs

625922
putty	winscp
for this one server programs like putty filezilla and winscp do not go past the first step searching for host

625925
sudoers	passwd
i don t know the administrator passwd sudoers passwd and have no access to root

625930
google-chrome	safari
in safari go to google s google-chrome page to download and install the osx version of google-chrome on your mac

626023
mouse	keyboard
i can discern no response to any input via mouse or keyboard and attempting to switch the system off with the front power button does nothing

626089
disk	ram
disk hard-drive not disc io rate and ram mhz accessibility depending if it is cold or hot data as well as a myriad of external interferences even temperature humidity and elevation however minute the effect

implement a perspective listener which will listen for perspective changed events and will show or hide the editors accordingly

626189
folder	directory
is there a dos powershell command i can write to open all files that share the same directory structure file name and extension for example opening the config files that are within a specific directory off of the root websites folder

626203
opera	firefox
opera behaved same as firefox

626212
debian	linux
our setup is a debian linux box with 2 drives in a software raid 10 for our server where all of our files are stored

626233
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu 13.04 linux operating system and when i connect the wireless network in my home my phone android or other devices can not browse but when i disconnect my computer from wireless network everything is okay

626236
wan	lan
router0 s wan interface connects to the isp and the wan interface of router1 and router2 connect to router0 s lan interfaces hard wired

626236
wan	lan
so in summary the wan port of router1 router2 each connect to a lan port of router0 and both are nat enabled are natting

626236
wan	lan
but it doesn t quite work yet because next i need to add iptable entries on both router1 and router2 to tell each to permit all wan originating traffic to pass on to it s lan side

626236
wan	lan	wan	subnet
as mentioned above they can ping the wan ip of the opposite router and they can ping the default route ip of the opposite lan subnet but they cannot ping ip-clients deeper inside the opposite lan subnet

626236
wan	lan
this i believe is because there also needs to be an iptables entry on router1 and router2 that permits all traffic originating on the wan side to enter the lan side â which is almost never a router s default behavior for security reasons

626236
wan	lan
they each need respective iptables rule s to allow all wan originating traffic to reach the lan network

626236
post	get
if i get to the solution first i will of course post the iptables commands

626248
hide	show
tabs say execute js hide console show source

626252
vpn	lan
depending on the type of vpn and how your workplace s network admin has configured it it may or may not be possible to tell your vpn client to not send local traffic through the lan

626252
vpn	lan
look for any option in your vpn client such as enable local lan or similar

mouse	keyboard
to get your mouse and keyboard to wake your computer from sleep open device manager and for the mouse and keyboard open up the dropdown list and then right click and go to properties on the entry

626348
disk	ram
another alternative since the clip is short might be to use a ram disk and shove the whole video in there

626351
disk	ram
indeed if one could cache the entire video into ram or keep a rolling buffer long enough using a faster disk drive wouldn t make any difference at all again assuming you have a large enough buffer

626369
sudo	passwd
the default livecd user account be able to use sudo without a passwd at the terminal prompt

626375
filesystems	fat
so you can not use fat formatted filesystems to host files of 4gib or larger

626375
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
since windows natively only supports a few filesystems you are limited to things like fat 4gb ntfs or iso9660 read-only

626385
wan	lan	wan	vlan
you would then connect a cable from the port in vlan 1 to a port on a lan port of the router and another cable from the port in vlan 2 to the wan port of the router

626385
wan	lan	wan	subnet
you would need to configure two ip addresses in different subnet for the lan and the wan interfaces

626385
wan	lan
for instance you could use lan 192.168.1.1 with a mask of 255.255.255.0 and wan 192.168.2.1 with a mask of 255.255.255.0

google-chrome	firefox
however when i try to use the same proxy with google-chrome firefox - both browsers work extremely slow

626724
mouse	keyboard
i m not familiar with the protocol but supposing there is no interesting side-channel data it seems like what we would need is a binary or script on m which would open up a window or just any rectangle on the vnc display using the rectangle for output and the keyboard mouse movement that this window gets as input

626724
mouse	keyboard
on the other side the vnc client must not display any of this junk on screen nor take keyboard or mouse input but rather just use ports to feed this data in and out

626731
macports	homebrew
you can install it via macports or homebrew with these commands respectively

626788

there are other features including being sent an email when security updates are released and an rss feed

626793
tunnel	vpn
a vpn tunnel was shut down and recreated with a different set of

626793
tunnel	vpn
routers when an attack was detected on the vpn tunnel

626793
tunnel	vpn
a vpn is started by connecting to a vpn server and obtaining information about the tunnel

626793
tunnel	vpn
if someone on the server end changed the dns to point to a different server during an attack the vpn setup software could still setup a tunnel using a different vpn server on that vpn

626910
ssl	https
ftps is ftp over ssl like https

626936

wan	lan	wan	vlan
for example some of the linksys 54g routers use only a switch with vlan tagging to separate the wan from the lan ports

626966
udp	tcp
udp doesn t have the session overhead associated with tcp

627000
vim	emacs

my setup is my isp is connected to my modem and the modem is connected to the main router a belkin on wan port of course and my main router connected to my second a dlink wan port connected to main lan port 1

627023
wan	lan
so if 192.168.2.x 24 255.255.255.0 is on both the lan and wan sides of a router it won t be able to figure out how to route traffic since there isn t a route between them needed as it s the same sub network

added tip i use both landscape and portrait on may different printers for work and play

627206
portrait	landscape
using that method each of the printers has a landscape printer and a portrait printer

wan	lan
for the guestroom and mainbedroom routers i strangely need to plug the network cable into the ethernet lan socket while for all the other routers i need to plug it into the internet wan socket on the router

627514
post	get
from your post it seems that you are more familiar with windows than linux but to set up something as simple as an ftp server in linux is easy what s more is that you can change the ftp port to 80 so that you get the least throttling from your isp and trust me everyone gets throttled no matter what your isp advertises

627521
mouse	keyboard
i don t know what your exact requirements are but autohotkey has two features which enable you to display keyboard and mouse events

ati	nvidia
if you put 2 high end video cards like nvidia 680 690 780 790 titian or ati radeon 6870 6890 7970 or 7990 then the second card will in some cases not have enough bandwidth to run at full speed

627563
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
in order to do this i had to automate eb tools because the current version 2.5.1 only runs in an interactive way so i edited eb tools code on some python files and then created a .travis.yml file with the appropriate instructions to deploy the app to amazon-web-services beanstalk

627578
tunnel	vpn
then all your branches will need vpn clients to establish tunnel to your vpn server

in case this isnâ t obvious you canâ t actually do an in-place upgrade from a 32-bit versioning of windows to a 64-bit versioning fo windows 8

627796
mouse	keyboard
external usb keyboard mouse have model numbers for drivers

627842
afp	smb
i am wondering if there is any application solution available on windows using which i can access this file server using afp protocol rather than using smb so it would be like accessing from actual mac

627851
filesystems	fat
fat filesystems have a file allocation table if any of the sectors in this table are bad when formatting then formatting will fail

627862
hex	binary
i have a binary file like this open in emacs hex mode

627866
hex	binary
one solution would be to use od to convert the binary to hex and output that in ascii which you can then pipe into grep to search for the hex string

627899
openvpn	iptables
i suspect this is because i need to fiddle with iptables or route to make sure tor is left alone by openvpn and will not be routed through openvpn because in reality openvpn has to go through tor

versioning	upgrade
i was having this problem when trying upgrade ati catalyst from versioning 8.00.0873 to 8.00.0911 where i was getting a bsod blue screen in windows 7 x64 with an ati radeon 5450 every time setup was detecting hardware configuration

627977
portrait	landscape
select both sheet1 and sheet2 or use print entire workbook and the print preview will show sheet1 in portrait and sheet2 in landscape

627978
versioning	upgrade
this is also really nice to do without specifying the exact ruby versioning so when a patch level comes out upgrade rvm and your wrappers will point to the newer patched ruby without needing to unload load the launchd files

627998
vmware	virtualbox
instead of dual booting use a virtual machine vmware or virtualbox and install linux to that

628005
mouse	keyboard
if you are not able to do that for eg if mouse and keyboard both not working then you donâ t have any choice but to switch off the power button

apache	nginx
my server runs nginx and php via php-fpm which by default runs php processes under the apache user the only user with write access to var www aside from root

628110
ftp	smb
this is because you are transmitting over to a shared drive using windows smb rather than using ftp file transfer protocol which is meant for transferring large files

628110
ftp	smb
the recommendation is to use smb for smaller files larger files should be transferred using ftp

628148
mouse	keyboard
7.disable the ports you don t want anyone to access don t disable the ports which are connected to components like mouse keyboard etc

628187

628372
winpcap	wireshark
on windows wireshark depends on the winpcap library to do the capture

628395
filesystems	ntfs
one way to help with data recovery is to use a filesystems that is more tolerant of corruption and contains better backup and recovery functions such as ntfs over fat32

628411
vmware	virtualbox
you can run it in os x with vmware workstation or virtualbox although it s afaik is against apple s license otherwise no there s no such kind of an emulator to just run apple mail without an os x itself

628412
disk	ram
more cpu processing more ram more disk i o and newer instructions required by the os

628412
disk	ram
making a move to linux could also help greatly for this reason and it will reduce your overhead on your cpu ram and disk

628412
disk	ram
if you can t get enough ram you don t have adequate disk i o your cpu usage is 60 idling and your cpu doesn t support the instruction required you will be crying because of how slow browsing is and the errors because of it

cpu	processors
it s a dual core cpu and one processors is almost always at 100 usage but processes are all nil system idle process is at 99

629778

so your processors speed increased but whatever activity was using the cpu still uses the same ratio of the cpu it is just doing more of it per second

629783
put	get
i suppose the same could apply to a hard-drive but like hennes said if the head dies then it doesnâ t matter where the scratch is on the platter but if you have enough money you could get a host drive with a good head to put the platters in and recover the data

usually gentoo linux s package manager portage installs in the root of the filesystem hierarchy known as

629883
gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	linux	freebsd	linux
on systems other than gentoo linux this usually results in problems due to conflicts of software packages unless the os is adapted like gentoo freebsd

by using an offset the prefix location it is possible for many alternative user groups to benefit from a large part of the packages in the gentoo linux portage tree

629883
gentoo	solaris	gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	linux	freebsd	solaris	freebsd	aix	freebsd	linux	solaris	aix

by default if i recall correctly from reading windows internals books ntfs by default syncs all dirty filesystems buffers to disk every 5 seconds

630391
disk	ram
the writes occurring on lines 2 5 and 7 occur in ram and the disk doesn t move until 5 seconds have elapsed since the first write and then the latest data from line 7 gets written into block 1 and the only data written into block 2 gets written

630391
disk	ram
so the total number of times that block 1 got written to ram is 3 and to disk 2

630391
disk	ram
the total number of times that block 2 got written to ram is 2 and to disk 2

630391
disk	ram
the writes occurring on lines 2 5 7 10 and 13 occur in ram and the disk doesn t move until line 14 is executed and then the latest data from lines 10 and 13 gets written into blocks 1 and 2

630391
disk	ram
the reason they say you should use a battery backup is that you don t want to have 35 minutes worth of written data buffered in ram that isn t written to disk just because your programmer was lazy and didn t call flushfilebuffers and then have a power failure

630411
lvm	mdadm
lvm and mdadm can expand the block device then you can run resize2fs

now google-chrome and firefox resumes resolving the tld

630727
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox detects this is a new network a new ip and things work fine

630727
google-chrome	firefox
once google-chrome and firefox understands network is down it assumes things wont work on the same network

630737
folder	directory
take a look at your root directory if you see a folder named damagedfiles it could be a sign that your hard drive is failing

630927
tunnel	packets
when i am trying to communicate with the system s ipv6 network my data packets would be sent through the tunnel broker which would work as nat and drop the ipv4 header and forward the ipv6 header and data to the ipv6 network

630927
tunnel	packets
if my pc has an ipv4 address and i am trying to communicate with the system with an ipv4 address then will my packets data be transferred through the tunnel broker

630938
tunnel	packets
if your have an ipv6 tunnel broker then your ipv6 packets will be put inside ipv4 packets

630938
tunnel	packets
those packets are then sent to the ipv4 address of the tunnel broker where the ipv4 header is removed and the inner ipv6 packets is forwarded to the ipv6 internet as usual

backward compatibility in wine is superior to that of windows as newer versioning of windows can force users to upgrade legacy windows applications

631107
16-bit	64bit
as illustrated by screenshot on the left wine can run 16-bit windows programs on a 64bit operating system which uses an x86-64 64bit cpu

631107
16-bit	64bit
64bit versions of microsoft windows cannot run 16-bit windows programs

631107
16-bit	64bit
dos and 16-bit windows applications therefore cannot run in 64bit versions of windows without third-party emulation software dosbox or a virtual machine with either a 32-bit version of windows windows xp mode or dos itself

one with the normal list of cron jobs then another one with the normal list plus this job

631468
imagemagick	pdftk
another solution for automating this is to use pdftk which unlike imagemagick s convert won t change the resolution

631671
email	dkim
you might be able to use the ip address on the header or some anti-spam extentions to email such as dkim to ascertain if its the correct server but as its designed its a pretty trusting protocol

i have a 64 gb thumbdrive that i would like to use on a centos 5.4 linux machine that does not seem to support ntfs

631952
filesystems	fat
try using gparted this frontend will allow you to format the usb with the fat filesystems

631962
filesystems	ntfs
i believe the best choice would be to use ntfs filesystems as already mentioned

631962
filesystems	ntfs
to mount any ntfs based filesystems you need to install a tool called ntfs3g

631968
filesystems	fat
i would not recommend any fat filesystems lack of journal file size limitations etc.

one mouse and one keyboard have power options the hid ones do not

632166
screens	tablet
what other working options exist to use one pc tablet as the screens of another

632169
mouse	keyboard
i was wondering if there is anyway that i could have the surface pro s screen extend onto my laptop s - in a dual monitor setup using something like maxivista which does not work with win8 but one that actually works with win8 - while still being able to control it using keyboard + mouse from the laptop

632169
mouse	keyboard
but the mouse + keyboard part can still be handled using a dock of somekind no

632169
mouse	keyboard
the laptop s keyboard and mouse control the surface and the laptop monitor acts as the second screen

632170
titlebar	window
settings settings manager window manager theme tab kokodi it has a high titlebar

632170

i think i have checked for ram hard disk and driver compatibility now

632185

maybe triggered by the same mechanism that would start the screensaver but obviously one that would allow the use of keyboard and mouse and would have a key combination that would let the staff member unlock the computer

632358
hide	show
this example script hide the taskbar sleeps 3 seconds and show the taskbar

632359
rtp	rtsp
if you don t want to spend any money and can live with extreme lag and very low fps you can try something like writing a pipeline in gstreamer or videolan vlc to capture the local framebuffer encode it in some video codec and stream it via shout or rtp or rtsp or similar streaming protocol then download stream it from your slower computer

632450
vpn	lan
how to i list possible directories that are accessible on the vpn lan

632473
ffmpeg	libavformat
since it s based on libavcodec and libavformat from the ffmpeg project and ffplay handles the file just fine vlc should have no major issues with it

this ends up breaking several cron jobs until i remember to correct it back

you can then switching between them split the screens to show several programs at once or even disconnect and reattach to the same programs later

632508
ubuntu	linux
what are all possible attributes a file can have for ubuntu linux latest with ext4

632513
x86	64bit
amd licensed their 64bit x86 implementation to intel after intel s non-backwards-compatible ia64 implementation was a market failure

632513
x86	64bit
so just choose x86 amd64 provided you are running a 64bit os

632554
put	get
i can t get above 1050 and no matter what i put the voltage to pumping more juice doesn t increase stability

632576
put	get
you will actually get worse performance if you put all 3 of these in a 2000 sqft house

632576
wan	lan
once you have done that plug the ap s into the network making sure to plug into the lan port not the wan port

632583
ssd	sata
edit when booting the dvd in legacy mode install will boot however the ssd is inaccessible due to a missing sata driver

632590
google-chrome	firefox
to import those settings to google-chrome save your work and close all firefox windows

632590
folder	directory
i have tried moving my user data folder to another directory and uninstalling reinstalling chrome neither of which have fixed this issue

632614

so you can use rdp without setting up vpn-related stuff and it will be as safe as any other ssl protected protocol https vpn etc

632618

since they don t have sudo access i have to change the folder permission for tomcat directory

632632
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
this along with lack of tab switching in mru order are the main reasons i use ie opera and firefox more than google-chrome

632665
disk	ram
you might only hope that most part of the memory footprint is in disk instead of ram so maybe this option is not too far-fetched

632686
udp	tcp
i am familiar with hole-punching but i gather that this is a udp thing not tcp

632725
ubuntu	linux
it s running ubuntu linux

632739

632780
disk	ram
full disk encryption by necessity needs the key in ram to encrypt decrypt data in real time

632780
disk	ram
full disk keys may be recovered from a target system s ram if it s connected via firewire to a host running the right software and the target system has a firewire driver that supports this

632780
disk	ram
full disk encryption does protect you against someone taking the hard drive out of the system and trying to read it in another system while it is asleep if they don t extract keys from ram directly which is an advanced operation

632782
disk	ram
the fact that most current full disk encryption methods use ram to store the keys makes them only partly secure while the system is running

632795
chown	sudo
then run sudo chown root library launchagents test.plist and sudo launchctl load library launchagents test.plist

632801
filtering	grouping
in grouping policy you may need to go to view menu click filtering and uncheck only show policy settings that can be fully managed.

632841
disk	ram
when you hibernate a computer it caches active ram out to your hard disk

632841
disk	ram
there are tools designed to break into truecrypt volumes which scrape ram for your key and if your volume is not mounted it will fall back to checking your hiberfil.sys on windows to see if it was cached to disk during the last hibernation

632842
virtualbox	parallels
however performance and reliability are way worse than with virtualbox parallels or fusion

632845
macports	homebrew
if you don t mind a little bit of program duplication homebrew and macports can coexist peacefully

632845
macports	homebrew
homebrew lives in usr local while macports lives in opt local by default so all you have to do to keep the brewed programs as the defaults on the command line is make sure usr local bin comes before opt local bin in your shell s variable

632859
cpu	affinity
on macs there s no an easy way to set cpu affinity so this could an interesting workaround for the older programs that don t work well in multi-core environments

632880
hide	show
use right-click â toggle field codes to edit single fields or hit alt + f9 to show hide all fields at once

for the past three years i ve been a devoted linux user on my desktop and laptops a few months using arch linux great learning experience but now mainly ubuntu specifically xubuntu lightweight non-3d xfce based desktop

633033
put	get
however if i put the problem dvd back into the drive i get the error condition again

633038
google-chrome	firefox
as an avid user of both browsers i can confirm that firefox offers minimum support and google-chrome exact support

633077
centos	linux	versioning	upgrade
i tried upgrading my chrome 26.x by going to the about google chrome page -- but unlike my windows chrome the linux chrome centos 6.0 v 26.x did not offer to upgrade to the latest versioning

in powershell how can i move all files in a folder to a new child directory

633111

i ve also tried making the directory first and then doing the move but i get a the process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process error presumably because it is then trying to move the bar folder to itself

633139
ethernet	wireless
the adsl modem s lan ethernet port is connected to the input unfiltered ethernet port on the ups and the output filtered ethernet port on the ups connects to my router which then forwards the connection over a wireless lan

633174
ethernet	wireless
the device has been set up and operates normally using wireless devices associated with the router but wired ethernet devices cannot communicate with chromecast

633174
udp	tcp	igmp	tcp	igmp	udp
there are igmp tcp udp packets between chromecast and a wireless interface on the laptop

633174
udp	tcp	igmp	tcp	igmp	udp
there are igmp and tcp but zero udp packets exchanged between chromecast and a wired ethernet interface on the same laptop

633182
versioning	upgrade
as stated if you want the latest versioning without too much trouble you really need to upgrade your os

633208
mouse	keyboard
i have created a service in etc init.d be able to wake up from keyboard and mouse with the following code

633263
wan	lan
on my router s admin interface page it lists my wan ip as 10.5.50.xxx however if i m not mistaken the 10.x.x.x network is a private network meaning this ip address would not be accessible from outside my lan

633263
ftp	telnet
when i port scan it it says that the ftp ssh and telnet ports are all open however when i try to connect to it using any of these methods they are all refused

633267
avr	microcontroller
refering to mazidi s avr microcontroller and embedded systems book the digital output from adc is calculated by the below formula

google-chrome	firefox
is there any way to prevent specific js scritps messing with browser firefox or google-chrome

633290
hide	show
press alt to reveal menu then check show hidden files and folder from and uncheck hide protected operating system files recommended

633292
hide	show
find change folder and search options and you must deselect hide protected operating system files recommended not the show hidden files folders and drives

633299
ubuntu	debian
the server is running debian and i m using ubuntu locally

633321
vmware	virtualbox
before installing vmware virtualbox i could play civilization 5 in a local lan now that i installed vmware virtualbox i can t find any local lan games anymore on the desktop pc

633321
vmware	virtualbox
any ideas besides deleting the vmware virtualbox software

633327
vmware	virtualbox
you can disable the virtual network adapters that virtualbox and vmware have created

633341
filesystems	xfs
and i do run 4 drives in a stripe having xfs as filesystems

633435
mouse	keyboard
turn your iphone and ipod touch into a wireless keyboard and mouse for your computer

633443
google-chrome	firefox
the problem was caused by a broken firefox profile so reinstalling google-chrome would not help

633443
google-chrome	firefox
when google-chrome is set up to import settings from firefox it seems to update bookmarks at every start

633443
google-chrome	firefox
disable automatic import from firefox to google-chrome by removing check marks in this screen

633443
google-chrome	firefox
check that firefox process is stopped at the moment of import to google-chrome use task manager

633445
pop-up	dialog
of course if the application pop-up a dialog when you tell it to quit this doesn t help

i purchased a few months ago a kinivo btd-300 bluetooth 3.0 usb dongle and thus far have had very little issue with it

633493
ubuntu	linux
while i am very aware that this make my ubuntu installation completely void of most ubuntu support i am still wondering if there are any real advantages to force a linux distro to the shiny new stable kernel from the upstream devs

633566
opera	google-chrome
of course this does not cover google-chrome and opera

633599
folder	directory
check directory and file sizes using du --si path to folder

633611
sudo	passwd
also by default when attempting to execute a command as another user using sudo we have to provide our own passwd

633613
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
with a lot of files and sub-directories several thousand or more in one directory you can experience performance issues with fat based filesystems as the directories listings there are stored in a relatively unstructured manner but for ntfs this is not the case as the listings are stored in an indexed structure that is more efficient to search and modify if you are using linux too there is a similar difference between the ext2 and ext3 ext4 newer filesystems

633615
ethernet	wireless
fyi the reason i know that the bt hub is the culprit is because i can force ps3 media server to use the wifi connection on the desktop rather than the ethernet which means its initial contact is to the wireless access point which then routes to the ps3

633633
mouse	keyboard
i only have access to the monitor which has the mouse keyboard and internet ports all attached

633648
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i can set the value of network.http.connection-timeout in about config - but how can i do that in google-chrome

633654
wan	lan
i already set up my router to forward to a specific lan ip but when i test entering my wan ip it pops up the router s authentication box meaning that it doesnt forward to my computer but instead to the router how can i solved this

633654
wan	lan
i want to forward wan ip example 123.456.789 456 to my lan ip example 192.168.0.120 which has ubuntu 13.04 with xampp...thanks

633686
ethernet	wireless
since i wanted to share it and create a wireless connection i connected the ethernet connection to the router to create a wireless connection

633697
ethernet	wireless
connect an ethernet cable from the 2nd nic in your desktop to a lan port on a wireless router

i am trying to load debian linux on my lacie ss4000e i have been trying to follow this tutorial

633731
post	get
post a screenshot of the login box you are getting and i may be able to be more specific but i assume it s asking for a new password because you have the option checked to login to notes using your os password and your notes password doesn t match so it s trying to get you to change it so they sync up

633739
screens	tablet
i am about to buy a tablet with a screens resolution of 1280 x 800 215 ppi

i tried the split text into columns on excel using the delimiter option and separating by spaces but the fact that some product names had more that one word caused the some numbers to be in the wrong column

ubuntu	opensuse
the really strange part is that i have the same problem with windows 7 and opensuse 12.3 double boot and ubuntu 12.04 live usb

if you have any that start with mysql- from mysql.com check with rpm -qa | grep -i mysql remove them and install those that are part of the standard distributions yum repositories

udp	tcp
everything seems to work so far all tcp traffic on my osx system is done through the ssh tunnel but the problem is with udp traffic and because of that dns queries are not working

633862
versioning	upgrade
the only way to upgrade your uefi versioning that i am aware of being possible is to wait for updates to firmware from vendor

633897
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
is there any reason why a computer running linux debian ubuntu zentyal in this case would power itself off abruptly especially at exactly 3am

633898
apache	nginx
i also suggest you to use nginx since you have to deal with static content it is lightweight and faster than apache expecially on the raspberry pi

633917
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
in my experience if you wish to run linux on this machine your best bet is linux mint 13 and ubuntu 12.04

633917
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
the linux driver is available in the ubuntu 12.04 repos and so mint 13

633918
wan	lan
i can use the output of the second nic in a windows xp 7 8 pc to be the input of my wan port of an existing lan .

633918
wan	lan
tether it for an internet connection and connect that pc to the wan port of my wireless wired home router which will supply private ip address to the rest of my lan

633918
put	get
to put it another way i want to disconnect the broadband which is not working and connect my second nic of my pc to supply internet access to my lan and be able to switch back again when i get the broadband access back

633926
bash	zsh
my question is similar i want to change the title of a terminal i m using a debian based distro terminator and zsh oh-my-zsh the title was fine with bash but when i moved to zsh it shows bin zsh as title

i ve enabled the hotmail and the gmail accounts leaving the apps one disabled - it seems like it does not lock up

633927
gmail	hotmail
with the hotmail and the apps accounts enabled gmail disabled it seems like it locks up after a random amount of time

633927
gmail	hotmail
with hotmail enabled and gmail and apps both enabled but set to receive only custom folder downloading not all subscribed folders - sometimes it locks up right after a send receive sometimes it goes for hours without locking up and sometimes it only locks up when i send an email

634008
cpu	processors
however when i opened the case i found that the power supply was fine but the cpu cooling fan mounting bracket had cracked and the heat sink was completely off of the processors

634030
rpm	yum
therefore you should determine your architecture uname -m then download the lua i686 or x86_64 package from fedora and install it with rpm to restore yum to a working order

634034

bonus it runs on windows and linux freebsd hopefully soon

binutils	glibc
note the 2 passes of binutils gcc and glibc are still necessary but you also have to have a working copy of libc++.1.dylib - and you ll need to do that in 2 passes as well

634108
debian	linux
i have a linux machine which is currently running debian 7

634131
versioning	upgrade
fwiw newer versioning of paint include the option of zooming out which should help in your case but i don t know if i should recommend you to upgrade

634154
folder	directory
the settings for most programs are kept either in dot folder in your directory for example or in your directory

634157
mouse	keyboard
and as you found out yourself you can use autohotkey to simulate keys that are not available on your keyboard so you can assign them to mouse buttons

634163
photoshop	paint.net
it would show many programs can let us select just like photoshop paint paint.net windows media center windows photo viewer etc

634283
tunnel	vpn
your vpn connection profile may have split tunnel disabled

634329
ethernet	wireless
when i troubleshoot or try to set up a new connection the only responses i get are for ethernet connection not wireless

634365
udp	tcp
tcp wouldn t work but udp did

634405
chown	chgrp
chgrp and chown are out of the question as they simply have no effect on a mounted vfat partition

634414
filesystems	fat
since fat does not support notion of filesystems permissions at all let alone unix compatible ones linux mounts each file in the filesystems with the same owner and group-owner as specified in the mount command or fstab

634431
installation	upgrade
my collegue used the same installation dvd also doing a clean install and got professional edition at install no edition upgrade needed

634465
mouse	keyboard
computer only wakes up when keyboard and mouse are plugged into the usb hub

634465
mouse	keyboard
hub itself with nothing plugged in doesn t have an issue only when keyboard + mouse plugged in

634465
mouse	keyboard
so somehow fluctuations in power in the room result in the keyboard mouse waking the keyboard up when going through the hub

634502
subnet	packets
if your gigabit ports connections are going through the a device other then a gigabit switch you will probably find the number of packets forwarded per second is constraining your performance - this was the case for me when i had wifi and 100 megabit devices in a router rather then a switch - the wifi router couldn t push packets fast enough even on the same subnet between wired ports

634510
mouse	keyboard
assumes usb keyboard and or mouse

wake would bring system out of sleep when it detects keyboard input or mouse shake

x86	64bit
this question contains so much superfluous information it s nearly impossible to read the whole thing without getting confused but nevertheless in 64bit windows systems the x86 designation for program files is a layer of compatibility support for 32-bit software as ramhound pointed out

634528
x86	64bit
because there is so much software that supports both 32-bit and 64bit instruction sets therefore creating installations in both folders and software that only supports 32-bit needing the x86 folder it would be both unwise and unnecessary to delete it

portrait	landscape
is it possible to have different headers and footers for a landscape and portrait page in one document thus when you add a landscape page it needs to automatically use the landscape header and footer

634600
pull	push
when you git clone a repo you re automatically setting up a link between the remote repo and your cloned repo that allows you to git pull and git push changes back and forth from your master branch to the remote master branch

634741
ethernet	wireless
2 cameras that only have ethernet ports not possible to connect via wireless network

634750
ethernet	wireless
what i personally would do would be to either purchase a wireless bridge recieves a wireless signal and then you can use an ethernet cable from one of the ports or you can flash an old router with something like dd-wrt and build the bridge yourself

634756
hash	md5
it computes a md5 or sha1 cryptographic hash of the content of the file

634756
hash	md5
hash algorithm md5 sha1 or both default md5

634756
hash	md5
to display the md5 hash of a file type fciv.exe filename

634757
put	get
put the formula in any cell that is not in columns a b or c or you ll likely get a circular reference warning

634778
hash	md5
i would probably make sure that the application that generates the files also creates an md5 hash sum of the file

634790
ethernet	wireless
most wireless routers come with 4-5 ethernet ports

634790
ethernet	wireless
most of these like dlink or linksys for example have a client mode that will translate the incoming ethernet signal to wireless and connect to a router

after that your jobs in usr lib cron tabs should be handled by cron

635411
vmware	virtualbox
assuming you are using virtualbox and not vmware

635449
google-chrome	firefox
note however that unlike firefox google-chrome will try to load each webpage for each and every open tab

16-bit	64bit
does this mean that this is a 16-bit program and hence won t run on my 64bit windows 8 pro box

635584
ubuntu	linux
i asked this question here because i see it as a general linux problem not a ubuntu specific one which should be asked on askubuntu

635586
ubuntu	linux
linux version 2.6.18.8-x86_64-linode10 root build.linode.com gcc version 4.3.3 ubuntu 4.3.3-5ubuntu4 #1 smp tue nov 10 16 29 17 utc 2009

635595
filesystems	ntfs
most new filesystems - including ext3 and ext4 the most common filesystems for linux as i believe ntfs is as well

635595
postgresql	mysql
later on down the boot process if you have a database i m looking at mysql postgresql does not suffer from this you may have analogous issues with the mysql database - mysql is often not particularly robust google acid compliance mysql for this topic

635595
uptime	reboot
another somewhat jaded and possibly unfair to windows view might be this - linux boxes are more reliable then windows boxes as measured by uptime and the need to do reboot - thus it is possible that when linux boxes fail on reboot it is a hardware problem due to old age rather then a software problem - whereas a failing windows box may be detected sooner because of more frequent reboot

635597
mouse	keyboard
if the keyboard keeps you from getting into msconfig using the mouse in windows 7 under administrative tools it is the item called system configuration

635603
mtu	pppoe
some dsl isps require pppoe and pppoe adds 8 bytes of overhead per packet reducing your mtu by 8 bytes

635603
mtu	pppoe
good home gateway routers that do pppoe and nat use a trick called mss clamping to allow clients to stay set to their ethernet-standard 1500-byte mtu without having problems

635639
debian	linux
the files i am installing to linux filesystem using makefile are not being put into debian package

635643
chown	chmod
no more chmod chown etc

635656
keydown	keyup
when i press the lock key i get a lwin keydown and if i then release it i get an l keyup and an lwin keyup and the computer then locks itself

635666
folder	directory
what i d like to do is create directory symbolic links within each notebook that lead to another notebook - so a link to a folder elsewhere rather than within the notebook

635667
children	parent
the simplest way can be adding another column in wa say e where we put a simple formula counting how many children a parent has

635667
children	parent
now in wb we have in column a parent s name in column b we insert a child in column c there is offset of the first child of the parent and in column d number of children the parent has

635667
sorting	grouping
if your data in wa do not contain grouping parents you are able to get this by sorting them

635672
tex	mathjax
org-mode uses mathjax to typeset the tex when exported to html

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	burp	mitmproxy	firefox	safari
i have tried mitmproxy and burp with firefox safari and google-chrome on mac os x

635684
burp	mitmproxy
when using one of the browser https pages load as normal but they are not shown logged in mitmproxy or burp

635730
google-chrome	firefox
if you are using most recent versions of firefox now mega downloaded files are treated as a blob resource to purposely avoid writing files using html5 something google-chrome did when mega launched

635745
pptp	nat
finally i realized that i had checked the gre pptp box under tracking nat helpers in tomato webgui go to advanced- conntrack netfilter then scroll down to tracking nat helpers but the default state was unchecked

635747
put	get
it seems like it would but i ve heard latency across usb 3 can actually be pretty bad so i don t want to put out the money necessary to get this drive and find out that in actuality it comes out slower

635747
ssd	sata
so what do you guys think would a high quality usb 3 ssd beat the load speeds of a sata ii internal 7200rpm for gaming

635756
kde	gnome
this package installs kde desktop with minimal applications and you can continue to use you ubuntu gnome apps with it

635794
ethernet	wireless
you mention installing the recommended network drivers - i see four recommended with one being for dell wireless another being for dell bluetooth and two for the broadcom ethernet nic

635803
ssd	sata
based on these benchmarks i believe ssd on usb 3.0 will be faster than a 7200 rpm on sata 2

635808
vmware	virtualbox
i need to test ufd in virtual machine with vmware or virtualbox

635825
mouse	keyboard
is there any mouse actions that cannot be made by a keyboard shortcut

635826
switching	screens
i mean i want to switching from two tabs to raw terminal to see what was the output of the last command it could be several screens long

635828
udp	tcp
the direct answer to your question is probably that you ve forwarded port 1194 of the tcp protocol rather than udp

635828
wan	lan
then port forward udp 1194 from the internet wan through to the ip of the guest on your lan

635885
mouse	keyboard
yes there are tons of mouse actions that cannot be performed with a keyboard shortcut

635917
google-chrome	safari
i m a heavy google-chrome user for development and wanted to try out safari but how do i get the console to see my traces and other outputs

635921
avr	microcontroller
i have a custom avr microcontroller board that has a tcp ip module chip for communication with pcs

636001
subnet	vlan
you can issue the show ip route command to verify the connected routes exist to your vlan 1 and 100 subnet

636001
arp	icmp
it would be worth checking the arp table with the show arp command following an attempted icmp

636008
bmp	png
i have an image stored in bmp format and would like to convert it to png using imagemagick

636014
macports	homebrew
earlier i was playing around with homebrew macports and active state tcl tk after i got the new mac pro

i have renamed downloads folder to olddownloads from my d drive and when i issue dir command in command line i see that downloads folder is renamed to olddownloads and when i try to issue command cd downloads i get an error

636164
filesystems	hfs
hfs remembers the case of a name but the filesystems is case insensitive

636219
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh	tcsh	dash
emphasis on scope i don t really care about any shells other than the default interactive shell bash and any script that happens to use bin sh aliased to dash so there s no need to complicate this with anything extra for tcsh ksh zsh etc

636222
daemon	cron
surely if i create a cron job or daemon i can replace bin foo with something like bash -i -c bin foo to force it to use bash to load the right environment variables but this also means that i ll have to tinker with any third-party tools that might install daemon tasks or cron job on my behalf

636252
ssd	sata
i have a copy of windows 7 and i m trying to install it but i want to ensure that the hybrid hdd ssd 500gb 5400 rpm sata hdd and 32gb msata ssd will work when i m done installing

636269
disk	ram
not only can ramdisk plus create ram disk with the hidden ram above 4gb

636272
debian	linux
there are many ssh clients for android on google play you may use one of them or you may install arch linux debian to your tablet and use openssh if it is rooted

636281
mtu	netlink
while ifconfig uses the old-style ioctl communication to alter the configuration in the kernel s network stack the kernel subsequently does all the work internally calling different functions to add an ip address and setting the mtu iproute2 uses the netlink messaging framework to communicate with the network stack

636323
apache	lighttpd
on this device i also tried several things but doens t get arm linux on it and all software solutions on android uses lighttpd which does not support mod rewrite like apache

636346
ubuntu	linux
the easiest way to solve this without writing your own custom softare script to fix it is download a linux live cd that supports ntfs ubuntu is a easy one to use and delete rename the folder from inside linux

636362

636492
ethernet	wireless
i have linksys router wrt54gl switching into 2 pcs with ethernet cable and also wireless enabled which i use in my android mobile

636559
afp	smb
if i mount a time capsule disk or another afp smb network resource and look on it with ls -la it appears as drwx------ so rsync can t access it even with sudo

636560
debian	linux	debian	mint
the following worked on my lmde linux mint debian

636562

plug the network cable into the lan port not the wan port

636650
mouse	keyboard
i have determined that the mouse and keyboard work but as soon as the boot order page is displayed or entering the bios after pressing the appropriate keys the screen goes blank

636650

i know how to edit etc sudoers so that i can run a command as sudo without having to enter my passwd however is there a way of allowing a program to be run completely without sudo by all users of a group

636753
ssl	https
attempts to connect over https return ssl connect error

636800
sudo	passwd
now sudo mount wont ask passwd but since it is a pain in the butt typing sudo all the time we can avoid it by dong the following

636817
cpu	processors
if the processors does not support network or i o virtualization that simply means that the vm will have to emulate them on the cpu not that you can t use them

636821
vmware	virtualbox
firstly you need to decide between a vm software that runs on a general purpose host vmware workstation player the desktop hyper-v varient or virtualbox for example or on a special purpose host hyper-v server or esxi

636821
pci	iommu
vt-d iommu on the other hand is nice to have if you have a host that supports pci passthrough and some other features

636867
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
the method will vary depending on your shell but in bash zsh and probably tcsh as well assuming anyone still uses it you need simply preface your emacs invocation with exec -- if you usually say emacs -nw instead say exec emacs -nw c

636872
ubuntu	linux
my specific hardware is a samsung arm chromebook + chrome os or sometimes ubuntu linux

636888
ethernet	wireless
in other words the windows 8 pc connects to the internet via a wireless connection and i d like to share that connection to my directv receiver which does not have a wifi card only an ethernet port

636904
robocopy	xcopy
robocopy supercedes replaces xcopy in windows 7 and allows limiting copies to n folder levels deep

636987
ethernet	wireless
what could possibly be different between my wireless and my ethernet

637079
ethernet	wireless
i ve had the isp company over here a few times they ve tested everything and have shown that the internet speed is in fact 90 mbs and sometimes even 100 mbs but their thought is that my ethernet and wireless ports on my hp can t accept or run at those faster speeds

637100
rss	feed
i have a list of approx 10 rss feed from different websites that i would like to view using feedly or something but i first need to filter these rss feed for a specific keyword in the title

637142
rss	feed
it had various methods of creating rss feed filters and any view available to it can be converted into its own rss feed pretty neat huh

637142
rss	feed
in this case i d probably use the filters function to set tags view the tag and create a rss feed based off it

637156
mouse	keyboard
why it doesn t receive io from keyboard but does receive mouse

637171
chown	mount
however you can change ownership of the existing directory system by using chown on the filesystem s mount point like

637180
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
magento uses md5 hash which are salt and stored in the database as a combination of

637180
hash	salt
so in your case 10d32f6e654e8a54062325962f7419d5 is the hash and 45 is the salt

637202
disk	ram
but for now i will say this apparently on this precise configuration dell m4600 having grub on irrt with linux on the real hard disk and windows on a mini-pci-express ssd with hibernation activated seems unsafe because the bsods still happen even with grub disabled which means the whole booting process is controlled by windows now and even with that it may have problems exiting hibernation - maybe the size of the 12 gb ram and thus 9 gb hyberfil.sys file play a role here and as one of these bsods could kill my ntfs partition in my previous configuration without any hardware fault because my ssd still works very well - i haven t checked its health in deep details though i don t see why it could not happen again

637203
installation	upgrade
sysprep must not be used on upgrade installation types

disk	ram
having said that yes ram disk do exist

637305
disk	ram
here are two examples of low end ram disk cards which made it into production

637305
disk	ram
note that there are way more ways of doing this than just by creating a ram disk in the common work memory

637305
disk	ram
i am sure there is way more to describe from amiga rad reset surviving ram disk to iops wear leveling and g-d knows what however i will cut this short and only list one more item

filesystems	fat
the filesystems fat or fat32 doesn t actually matter

google-chrome	firefox
i ve found to this question unicode play icon â present in a page title is incorrectly displayed in my firefox and tried the same solution in google-chrome but didn t solve it

637334
rsa	dsa
which is an rsa key not the dsa key i generated second problem

637345
disk	ram
in computing a page cache often called a disk cache is a transparent cache of disk-backed pages kept in main memory ram by the operating system for quicker access

637352
next	except
the end points aren t important except insofar as you probably want them to end one sector before the next start point in order to minimize wasted space

637356
post	get
unfortunately the details of how to get to this boot manager and what options it presents vary from one computer to another so if you can t find the relevant options you may need to call tech support or post on a manufacturer-specific forum to get the help you need

637359
ecdsa	rsa	rsa	dsa

the problem is consistent on google-chrome internet explorer and firefox

637376
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade opera to versioning 16 and ctrl+enter suddenly does not work anymore

637407
disk	ram
the idea is that ram is cheap and from a performance point of view read write operations on ram are 1000x faster than disk operations

637407
disk	ram
so most of the data is kept in the ram and then you define a data ageing strategy using which the old data is recycled back to cold storage disk

637420
folder	directory
i would ve thought it s recently or frequently used folder or perhaps directory that i ve added to my sidebar s favorites list but that s not the case

637451
filesystems	ntfs
chkdsk fails because it doesn t recognize a ntfs filesystems

637451
filesystems	ntfs
testdisk recognizes the ntfs filesystems but can t access the files

637452
rar	zip
does it take a longer time to delete files from a large tar zip and rar archive than a smaller one

637468
777	tmp
which is the rw option in etc exports to no is not enough to allow the clients to write in the directory - you must also make tmp sharetest world writable using chmod 777 see ref 3

637479
ethernet	wireless
it ll reroute packets from the ethernet interface to the wireless interface and start a dhcp server which will attribute an ip adress for both the ethernet card and the ps2

637479
ethernet	wireless
playstation 2 is connected by ethernet to the pc ethernet port and the wireless card of the pc is connected to your wireless network which is connected to internet

637492

i do all my immediate read write operations for content generation in ram disk on my local machine

637492
disk	ram
the second ram disk i use is 64 megabytes and all my internet browser s cache folders point there

637492

i m generating data 30-1000x faster using a ram disk than on my 7200rpm western digital

637496
folder	directory
there is another dropdown on the address bar that contains the parent directory of the folder you re at

637521
tunnel	vpn
the next best thing would be to have them connected but require a secure tunnel like a vpn from the wireless to the wired

637522
bluetooth	usb
you can picture the wireless devices as just a different way to connect to the same network much as keyboards can be connected via usb or ps 2 interfaces or bluetooth but once connected they all function the same

637527
put	get
i am guessing i need to put a master boot record on the external drive to get it to be recognized

637536
disk	ram
this causes vmware to copy the contents of the vmâ s ram to disk so that it can resume where it left off without having to boot up all over again

637536
disk	ram
when vmware copies the memory to disk the drive becomes more or less unresponsive to new disk operations until the current disk operations writing the ram to a file have finished

637536
disk	ram
if d is very fragmented then when vmware tries to flush the ram to disk it will cause it to thrash around a lot while writing chunks of the giant file to different areas of course this is assuming itâ s not an ssd which if d is still a partition on the same 0st320lt007 drive as c then itâ s not

637548
put	get
i recently updated it and the problem is solved although when i put some distance i get lag even if i go back near the computer so i just turn it off then on and the problem is solved once more

udp	tcp
netbios over tcp ip netbt sends the netbios protocol over the transmission control protocol tcp or the user datagram protocol udp

637709
udp	tcp
netbt uses the following tcp and udp ports

637713
folder	directory
what i m seeing again even if the destination directory doesn t exist is that all 12 folder get copied over but only 25 of the 31 files missing all 5 from one directory and one from the root directory

637746
vmware	virtualbox
you can you vmware or virtualbox to install the ubuntu virtually and swich between the two with one click

chown	chmod
final issue is that moving the file may not be enough for what you really want to accomplish as the permissions issue is due to the fact you re trying to transfer a file from somewhere in system tmp to somewhere in lib and probably will need to use the chown command to set proper owner and group and use chmod to set owner group global read write execute permissions on the file so the system can access it properly

640488
ubuntu	linux
the best bet you can have is partitioning your drive smartly using user account control with a secondary free os like linux ubuntu installed on other partition

640488
ubuntu	linux
you can save your pc from deadliest virus attack by providing barriers for it go unnoticeable spread across the whole machine for this make 2 accounts administrator standard from user account control settings give limited read write permission to standard user on c drive system drive no write permission to standard user on other partitioned drive vice-versa user account control on other drive on linux ubuntu

640488
ubuntu	linux
secondly if everything fails and windows get corrupt still you have a fair chance to recover everything safely as your machine will have dual boot option using linux ubuntu u will be able to boot from other drive manually scan or fix everything back to normal or to the minimum recover your valuable data

640494
sudo	passwd
then you can run sudo commands after this and they will not prompt you for a passwd

640528
sudo	passwd
or give your userid privilege to sudo shutdown without a passwd

640540
sudoers	passwd
you can switch off needing a passwd for your user or for your user executing shutdown by adding a line with the tag nopasswd to your sudoers file

640540
sudo	passwd
your passwd will be cached for 15 minutes so you would have to run a sudo -v all say 12 minutes to update your credentials and kill that task after the last batched process is done

640540
sudoers	passwd
you can increase the default 15 minute timeout of the passwd cache with the option timestamp_timeout in the sudoers file

640540
sudo	passwd
in between these two calls you can run sudo without entering your passwd again

640540
sudo	passwd
if you are not fine with not requiring a passwd for sudo but instead store your passwd in a text file readable only by your user then you can create a little batch script which outputs your passwd to stdout and either use this as the askpass program for sudo or simply use it in a pipe with sudo -s which read the passwd from stdin

640540
sudo	passwd
combined with a little script you could store your passwd in a text file at the beginning from which it is read by the script providing it to sudo and at the end delete this file again

udp	tcp
i just noticed that vsmon.exe from zonealarm firewall started to act like proxy for tcp connections i am guessing it s doing the same thing for udp packets internally

644851
disk	ram
basically for sleep mode the computer turns off disk drives displays etc and copies state out of power-hungry components into ram the last power-hungry component being the cpu itself

644851
disk	ram
for hibernate most of the above occurs plus any additional state is saved that was not saved above and then the ram image is written to disk ie persistent storage as one big file though on a reserved location in disk

644851
disk	ram
at this point there is no state in the machine that is not represented by the ram image on disk and the computer can be completely powered off

644851
disk	ram
when the cpu is powered back on it checks for a ram image on disk and if there is one and there s been no subsequent boot the image is read back into ram and the system essentially restarts as if from sleep

ssd	sata
i am aware that 3 and 6gb s transfer speeds are not realistic anyway and more of symbolic nature but using the atto ssd benchmarking tool i could see that drive e actually only runs at half speed 250 gb s instead of 500 gb s which is why i d like to swap sata ports

645160
ssd	sata
however i am concerned that after swapping the sata ports on the mobo between d and e they might be confused by windows windows looking for user account data on the intel 520 ssd instead of the western digital hard disk

fat	hfs+	filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs+
this means that either the partition must use fat or hfs+ on macs or you must install an efi filesystems driver for the filesystems in question

645699

hdd	floppy
now i have always thought that -- disregarding differences in their buses form-factors storage capacities and other low-level hardware details -- all storage devices would be the same as far as their partitioning and bootability are concerned so much so that i could simply copy enough initial sectors of a smaller device to a larger device regardless of the source and destination device-types floppy flash drive cd hdd etc and still have the larger device function exactly like the smaller device

648817

instead of letting the monitor remain on for 15 minutes for nothing your best best is to do what i do and simply get into the habit of either turning the monitor off whenever you get up to step away or to manually put it into standby mode

if you have enough ram to do so one way to work around caching would be to simply move the database files to a large ram disk for the duration of your tests

649121
wan	lan
i heard that one of the lan ports can be used as a wan port

ideally i d like to mount the external hard drives from the linux machine on to the omnios server as if they were local disk ie block level access to actual hard drives so that all of the zfs checksumming is done on the omnios machine because it has 8 cpu cores and ecc ram while the linux machine is a desktop htpc dual core with non-ecc ram

google-chrome already has a plugin for flash but firefox needs the full flash install

649585

the rest can be accessed using various different ram disk drivers not the ms one of course go look for something that uses the invisible address space or high 4gb space on xp pro

649594
put	get
finally with 50 pc s you really should be employing a sysadmin if you are the sysadmin get the business owners to put you on a proper course and get qualified mcse or similar - because licensing is just the tip of the ice-berg when if comes to maintaining a business system domain with active directory ..

tunnel	vpn
this is likely due to the configurations on the cisco vpn device you are connecting to not allowing split tunnel

649918
tunnel	vpn
when you connect to the vpn via the ciscoanyconnect client it receives directions from the cisco vpn device to not allow split tuneling only allow traffic to come to this device via the tunnel and we will route it from here so any traffic outside of that remote network is routed from and subjected to the same security as if you were physically sitting at a location within the network

the keyboard will not type and the mouse will not move

plug the keyboard and mouse into regular usb ports not the usb 3 ports

649953
mouse	keyboard
as long as the computer is connected to the internet if you re-insert the keyboard and mouse windows should automatically install the necessary drivers

649953

this section is probably not the issue since you notice that they do work while in bios but if you still do not have any progress getting the keyboard and mouse to work ensure they will work on another computer if available

if another one isn t available and this is a wireless keyboard and mouse change the batteries

cpu never processes things on disk it doesn t address things on disk it only addresses ram locations or no doubt cache locations
