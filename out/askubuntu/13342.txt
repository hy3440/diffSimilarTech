xfce	kubuntu
i now have kubuntu with an xfce splash and login

8
xfce	kubuntu
how do i safely purge xfce and just have the kubuntu splash login screen or am i stuck with frank-en-buntu

52
sudoers	visudo
add the following line to etc sudoers use sudo visudo to edit the file

62
folder	directory
ubuntu uses ecryptfs which stores all the data in a directory this case the home folder as encrypted data

68
kde	gnome
either way i would recommend not installing x server and a desktop manager gnome kde etc

85
folder	directory
the dropbox daemon will synchronize one folder usually dropbox but you can include other files or directory in the synchronization by symlinking them into that folder

87
dpkg	aptitude
dpkg apt-get aptitude tasksel synaptic

129
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
in reality apt-get aptitude synaptic and the ubuntu software center are all just front-ends to either dpkg or apt which is in itself a front-end to dpkg

148
kde	gnome
there are other lightweight alternatives that might fit the bill if you don t require features such as layers or filters gnome paint and kolourpaint for kde

168
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu you can ask people for reviews on #ubuntu-motu on irc.ubuntu.com and for debian there is a #debian-mentors channel on irc.oftc.net

178
pull	push
if you want to get fancy you can create a cron script to automatically push pull changes every so often always keeping your files up-to-date

264
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
i especially enjoy this when a upgrade to a new ubuntu versioning and the installation goes weird

279
installation	upgrade
in the past i ve gone hog wild customizing my ubuntu installation only to be unable to upgrade it once the time came

281
daemons	systemd
once you start playing around with server daemons you will soon be confronted by the systemd wide configuration under etc

291
ubuntu	linux
i ve always thought that the ubuntu hour isn t supposed to preach ubuntu to the linux converted although if that happens it s not necessarily a bad thing it s more supposed to be try and encourage people who don t have any experience of linux let alone ubuntu to give it a try

291
ubuntu	linux
consider making a small sign just an a4 sheet folded into three - making a triangle should be fine and write in very clear text give ubuntu linux a try

293
hide	show
i may be out of subject but you can just press escape during boot to show hide the plymouth splash screen.

294
ubuntu	linux
have a look at conky â a light weight system monitor for ubuntu linux systems it has some screenshots and directions on installing it on ubuntu via repositories

315
ubuntu	centos
in an effort to keep things consistent i ve been slowly but surely replacing centos and bsd servers with ubuntu lucid

315
asterisk	freeswitch
either asterisk or freeswitch preferably pre-packaged by a vendor in .deb format

318
versioning	upgrade
as part of the package upgrade process if you have modified a configuration file you will be asked if you wish to keep the modified file or install the new versioning and have the opportunity to view the differences

359
google-chrome	firefox
a few days using applications that they use in windows firefox google-chrome thunderbird openoffice songbird skype

380
kde	gnome
although a kde app i think it s fairly robust and works well even in a gnome environment

397
pecl	pear
cpan gems pecl pear etc are package managers for their respective languages

410
cpu	processors
i sometimes use the cpu frequency scaling monitor to limit the power my processors cores use

413
ubuntu	debian
it is targeted at debian and not officially supported for ubuntu but works quite flawlessly on my ubuntu boxes

417
kde	gnome
i want to have both kde and gnome shells on ubuntu

423
uptime	reboot
it shows a set of information at the bottom of the screen and that can include whether a reboot is required - along with whether updates are available the time uptime memory used .

433
direct3d	directx
i was going to say that directx 3d games and apps were out of the question but research seems to indicate that it now has direct3d support

460
mouse	keyboard
i want answers to be command-line only as i do not have any keyboard or mouse connected to that computer

469
uninstall	upgrade
however it will allow you to upgrade or uninstall cleanly

491
daemons	systemd
it talks over dbus to a systemd daemons udisks-daemon and asks it to unmount

491
daemons	systemd
the daemons checks if you re allowed to do that by contacting another systemd daemons policykit

495
kde	gnome
choosing between graphical environments kde gnome

499
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
- there is the option of keeping a fresh repo in whatever version control system the package uses svn hg git bazaar ... and keeping it built from sources

510
kde	gnome
kile a powerful editor for kde can be installed under gnome and works fine apart from changing some configuration details to use the gnome pdf viewer for example

526
wmv	flv	wmv	asf	wmv	ogg
moovida is a media center application that allows you to easily create your digital library and watch any of your media divx h264 avi asf wmv mkv flv mov ogg and almost any audio format... on your tv

541
ubuntu	linux
mono apps can run on ubuntu linux windows and mac os

548
daemons	systemd
that could either have been done by having an actual user account on the systemd or by tricking a slightly vulnerable and publicly available server daemons

574
bash	zsh
i recommend the following book which covers zsh bash and some other shells

574
bash	zsh
i have been using the command line a lot since a few years locally and via ssh i ve only recently made the switch to zsh myself mostly because of my custom bash prompt which is not compatible

574
sudo	passwd	bash	zsh
you can use chsh -s bin zsh to switch your shell via etc passwd or just call it from your current shell type zsh in your bash prompt you likely have to install it first though sudo apt-get install zsh

582
ubuntu	linux
a good resource is the book ubuntu linux toolbox 1000+ commands covers all you need to know

584
vmware	virtualbox
use vmware workstation commercial or virtualbox free

585
vmware	virtualbox
besides vmware and virtualbox there is the ubuntu wubi installer

600
ubuntu	linux
a blog on linux mostly ubuntu and open source web applications and news

629
ubuntu	linux
this is quite the opposite of what usually works -- on windows and other ubuntu other linux systems -- where i press alt and then add shift

637
filesystems	ntfs
since wubi creates a file within the windows ntfs filesystems and uses this as a pseudo partition it is very difficult to do this

698
min	max
much like the new indicator applet windicators will actually be an indicator that sits on the window likely occupying whatever space the window controls min max close aren t

699
kde	gnome
this is the kde flavor of the typical ubuntu which is gnome driven

699
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
the primary difference is that kubuntu comes with kde as the default desktop environment as opposed to gnome with the unity shell

699
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
it uses xfce which is a proven faster desktop environment than both kde and gnome

699
kde	gnome
fluxbuntu does not come with a desktop environment like gnome or kde

700
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
kubuntu focuses on kde tools while ubuntu focuses on gnome tools and so on

710
fish	zsh
if you wish to use another command interpreter like zsh or fish how do you get this to start as default

732
jobs	cron
i have a couple of cron jobs that sometimes produce error output and would like to get a notification in my real email account since i don t use my user s mailbox in my ubuntu laptop but cron or is it postfix maybe keeps trying to email the local root account

741
ati	nvidia
if however you want the latest drivers which typically offer bugfixes and performance improvements and don t mind the hassle you can go here for nvidia or here for ati

741
ati	nvidia
i don t know about the ati driver but but the nvidia driver comes as a script to run that will install the driver automatically compiling the kernel modules as required etc

745
temp	tmp
dh_auto_install make -j1 install destdir home documents temp jsoncpp jsoncpp-0.5.0 debian tmp returned exit code 2

770
ubuntu	debian
the library packaging guide at dancer column libpkg-guide libpkg-guide.html can be complex but it has some important information about the right way to package libraries so that they integrate well in debian ubuntu

792
ubuntu	debian
specifically debian and ubuntu

806
ati	nvidia
if you re looking to switch between the proprietary and free driver for your video card if you have an ati or nvidia card try jockey

807
vim	emacs
a lot of people will swear by vim and emacs but nano is a very good text editor

807
vim	emacs
nano is good for editing a config file but if you are going to program you ll be better off using vim or emacs

809
vim	emacs
emacs or vim but thats less good for stats are worth learning as they are both cross platform and support almost every programming language in the world

811
vim	emacs
i don t know anything about nano and emacs but you can configure and extend vim almost endlessly and it is available on most platforms

822
vim	gedit
however most of the time i just use gedit because i m not as powerful and effective as vim

825
vim	emacs
vim is like emacs only it uses a much different form of input

825
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are for programmers

825
vim	emacs
take your pick i m not taking vim vs emacs side for this post lol

827
textmate	gedit
you can make gedit looks and feel a little bit like textmate

841
filesystems	btrfs
grub legacy is no longer being maintained so distros would have to do all the work of patching it to support newer filesystems like ext4 and btrfs

848
hide	show
so when i move the mouse to that edge it either hide all apps screenlets included or show them all

852
ubuntu	linux
are there any ways of improving the performance of flash under ubuntu or is this just an issue with the linux version that i will have to live with

853
ubuntu	linux
it is theoretically possible to setup portage on ubuntu or any other linux

868
google-chrome	firefox
only firefox google-chrome and openoffice should be available for the guest user

882
ubuntu	linux
you can show to them how a particular ubuntu linux app is more suited easier cheaper

892
sudo	passwd
use sudo always and use strong passwd

954
mouse	keyboard
the ideal situation would be the tv show in one window with some mouse keyboard controls for volume channel

969
switching	screens
also with mac os x you have to bring focus to an application usually by clicking it to switching the menu to that application but with unity you will be running applications full screens so there is no confusion as to what application s menu you are accessing

972
versioning	upgrade
since patents related to font hinting have expired freetype has enabled font hinting by default you can upgrade to maverick or use the latest versioning of freetype for best results

973
ubuntu	linux
maintenance of the ubuntu linux

1002
ubuntu	linux
it can only install software in a ubuntu system but you can download the updates or new packages in any linux windows or os x

1016
dpkg	apt
the .deb files are stored in var cache apt archives then in the other computer launch synaptic and select and search the folder were you put the files and open it accept all or install from terminal using the command sudo dpkg -i deb_package_name

1034
ubuntu	debian
its not clear which symbolic link you replaced but if you have more than one java virtual machine installed its recommended to manage them with the alternatives system in ubuntu debian

1045
ubuntu	linux
the ubuntu help wiki has a section on installation without a cd with sections like from usb windows linux vm etc

1051
filesystems	btrfs
filesystems seeding 15 btrfs on read-only storage used as a copy-on-write backing for a writeable btrfs

1053
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs or butter fs is a filesystems and has some interesting features

1053
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is a extent-based filesystems

1067
post	get
i can only post one link until i get more cool points so i figured the tutorial would be a better link as it has a brief description

1068
sudo	passwd
i have tried running sudo oem-config-prepare after installing the remaster with oem-config oem-config-gtk oem-config-remaster and oem-config-debconf installed from synaptic in a new account called oem with the passwd also oem

1075
redhat	fedora	rpm	yum	gentoo	ubuntu
ubuntu s deb apt repositories fedora redhat others rpm yum repos bsd s ports tree gentoo s portage pkgsrc the list goes on

1077
dpkg	apt	ubuntu	debian
ubuntu uses the dpkg apt package management system from debian with ubuntu s own repositories

1086
kde	gnome
i use both gnome and kde sc

1086
kde	gnome
in gnome i use docky but i do not use it with kde

1086
kde	gnome
so i would like docky to start up only when i login into gnome not kde

1092
filesystems	ntfs
the underlying filesystems used by ubuntu like ext2 and ext3 simply don t need defragmenting because they don t fragment files in the same way as ntfs

1098
kde	gnome
this is the gnome alternative to the kde startup manager

1117
ati	nvidia
this means if you re running the closed ati nvidia drivers you ll have an ugly boot experience

1120
vim	emacs
i know that vim like emacs is very powerful editor for programmers as long as you know how to use it its shortcuts and so on

1124
ubuntu	opensuse
current users are ubuntu fedora opensuse maemo palm s webos

1128
daemons	systemd
upstart is an event-based replacement for the sbin init daemons which handles starting of tasks and services during boot stopping them during shutdown and supervising them while the systemd is running

1128
ubuntu	linux
upstart was originally developed for the ubuntu distribution but is intended to be suitable for deployment in all linux distributions as a replacement for the venerable system-v init

1152
ubuntu	debian
for lts releases ubuntu syncs with debian testing

1152
ubuntu	debian
for non-lts releases ubuntu syncs with debian unstable

1153
ubuntu	debian
in every ubuntu release there s an initial import from debian unstable for many packages in main

1205
sudo	passwd
even still if not configured to bypass passwd prompting for your user account sudo will also prompt you for your passwd

1224
folder	directory
is there a simple command to display the total aggregate size disk usage of all files in a directory folder

1273
versioning	upgrade
after i upgrade to the latest versioning and i m fully up to date i can no longer burn cds or dvds the os simply will not recognize any blank media

1292
opensuse	linux
the opensuse nomad solution is based on xrdp and i hear nomad is the best remote desktop experience you can get on linux

1307
vmware	virtualbox
is there any alternative to using this in ubuntu besides creating a virtual windows environment in say virtualbox or vmware and running the zune software there

1336
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is a derivative of debian

1336
ubuntu	debian
in what ways is ubuntu different from debian

1340
ubuntu	debian
like many popular conceptions the common characterizations of debian and ubuntu are only partially true

1340
ubuntu	debian
similarly while ubuntu has always emphasized usability like any distro much of its usability comes from the software that it includes â software that is just as much a part of debian as of ubuntu

1340
ubuntu	debian
in the comparison between ubuntu and debian the philosophy behind the software is the key difference between the two

1347
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu syncs from debian every six months weeks before every releases

1347
ubuntu	debian
any package that doesn t have any ubuntu specific changes in ubuntu the previous version was also from debian or isn t in ubuntu already gets synced into ubuntu s universe free and third-party

1347
ubuntu	debian
motu put a lot of work into maintaining the universe but this isn t where ubuntu differs from debian the most

1347
ubuntu	debian
this is where ubuntu is different from debian

1349
switching	screens
but when i switching to virtual console closed lid just turns the screens off

1355
ubuntu	centos
on red hat centos there is the install.log files that is generated when you install the system but this doesn t exist on ubuntu

1358
ubuntu	linux
it might even be silly for me to answer it given that i am on the server team and ubuntu definitely has a very large focus on making linux for humans ergo the desktop

1358
ubuntu	debian
one awesome part of that was that they i say they because i am not an ubuntu member yet could still keep a lot of the wide breadth of debian software by creating the universe archive

1358
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is to debian as your local restaurant is to the local farmer s market

1358
ubuntu	debian
chef ubuntu goes to the debian farmer s market periodically finds the best fresh ingredients mixes them with his own special blend and produces food for his intended audience

1359
ubuntu	linux	disk	ram
the linux kernel underlying ubuntu will automatically swap in those pages from disk to ram as needed so in general i d say just let it happen naturally

1422
folder	directory
when you open up a new terminal the current working directory should be your home folder

1446
ubuntu	linux
although ubuntu has many virtues so does macos x and even windows has its advantages - not to mention the other linux distros

1451
ubuntu	debian
it is suitable for creating .deb files for personal use but not stringent enough if you want to the package to be included in debian ubuntu - for that you should read the debian new maintainer s guide and or the ubuntu packaging guide which i believe you ve already tried

1475
ubuntu	linux
change the default operating system to ubuntu choose the one with the highest linux kernel version

1501
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu - basically just to try out and develop knowledge of kde

1506
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
you can install kde on ubuntu and gnome on kubuntu so it doesn t really matter

1517
ubuntu	debian
you need to have your program in the official debian ubuntu repositories and then anyone can upload a screenshot to

1568
ethernet	wireless
so the desktop has the mobile modem and an ethernet connection to the wireless router

1568
ethernet	wireless
and you want to run ubuntu on the desktop and share the 3g connection over ethernet and ultimately over wireless

1568

if it only has a wan port enable dhcp on that instead of ppp pppoe or whatever

1577
bash	zsh
i m considering moving from bash to zsh as i often come across posts praising zsh

1578
post	get
unfortunately it s not capable of playing the latest and greatest of games from what i could read however i was happy to finally get it to work at all i scanned post and howto s all over the web for weeks

1579
kde	gnome
so if as the last poster mentions you need the studio applications then add them or if you are a big fan of kde or gnome or specific apps to one de or the other you can use them

1584
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is very similar to debian and uses the debian package management system .debs apt-get etc.

1584
redhat	fedora
however there is a much bigger difference between ubuntu and fedora and redhat which use the redhat package management system .rpms yum etc.

1588
sudo	passwd
from what i understand the user account passwd only changes the passwd used to login to ubuntu and the sudo passwd for your account

1592
opera	safari
there are also mht-viewing plugins for opera safari

1592
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox extension + viewers for opera safari quicklook

1597
hide	show
in htop you can hide show kernel threads with k shift+k

1640
disk	ram
i sometimes find moving tmp to ram tmpfs is the best solution especially on my setups which use a lot of disk intensive io stuff - mysql etc if you have enough ram to feed it

1644
put	get
if i put an entry in etc fstab that tries to specifically mount this disk by uuid then that mount process and the udev mount process seem to end up in a battle with each other and the disk doesn t get mounted

1654
vim	emacs
bout vim and emacs are a bit hard to learn to use vim in my opinion being the simpler one

1658
geany	gedit
geany is lightweight and simple to use - perfect if you are looking for something more advanced than gedit but don t want need the complexities of a full-blown ide

1671
ubuntu	debian
the normal process would be to reparition your hd if you don t have another one install debian into the new free space don t install a new grub edit ubuntu s grub to boot to debian and you re done

1673
ubuntu	linux
installing ubuntu from a linux system this describes how to install ubuntu from another linux

1673
ubuntu	debian
you just have to change some settings because you want to install debian from an ubuntu

1676
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
if you have the partition space to install debian along side ubuntu as a dual boot setup as mentioned in previous answers then as you have a broken cd drive you can install debian and other linux distributions from a usb memory stick

1683
bash	zsh
as you say zsh is similar in many respects to bash

1684
disk	ram
when it s heavily used this is a temptation - we ll put tmp into a ram disk it ll speed up access and when the system reboots shuts down there s nothing to clean up

1684
disk	ram
however if you are thinking of implementing temp space as a ram disk that will be swapped then i would consider the ramifications of your system s swap space usage by other programs

1684
disk	ram
between swap activity and the additional i o streaming into the ram disk which in turn may cause additional page-ins to satisfy a seek your system will quickly become i o bound

1685
disk	ram
so what ever happened to hybrid suspend where it would suspend to both ram and disk

1695
google-chrome	firefox
is there a quicktime plugin for google-chrome or firefox and if not why

1697
versioning	upgrade
since i upgrade to ubuntu 10.04 and the versioning of emacs-snapshot there i encounter some problems

1714
dpkg	apt
and if possible reinstall the packages through apt or dpkg afterwards

1720
kde	kubuntu
if you use kubuntu or kde you ll want to use service kdm restart or etc init.d kdm restart

1741
pureftpd	vsftpd
what that means is that if you can ssh to the target machine you can almost always sftp to it as it uses the same auth mechanisms so no having to install and configure different server daemons at all no pureftpd or vsftpd

1744
dpkg	aptitude
i find typing aptitude search makes more sense to me than apt-cache search and i like that it tells me which packages i have installed right there in the search output instead of having to run dpkg -l

1746
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu it is better to use apt-get because its supported and endorsed by the company on debian i would use aptitude

1763
mockups	balsamiq
that s made by something called balsamiq mockups .

1765
mockups	prototyping
personally i like doing web-ui prototyping in inkscape vector graphic drawing program it is fairly simple to use and you can reuse most of the mockups when you are going to make the final product

1770
public	protected
to do that go to network and sharing center âÿ change advanced sharing settings turn on public folder sharing and turn off password protected sharing located under the advanced sharing options section near the bottom

1771
mockups	balsamiq
like balsamiq mockups it comes with a massive number of prefabricated components that allow you to quickly throw together a demo screen

1771
mockups	balsamiq
unlike balsamiq its default mock widget set looks like real widgets which i get concerned causes programmers to slavishly imitate the mockups they see on screen

ati	nvidia
the article covers the drivers installation for the nvidia amd ati and intel graphics cards

1790

this might even be the case in debian since a lot of ubuntu s packages are synced from debian

1807
ubuntu	opensuse
either something like the opensuse builder that lets you choose applications and packages for the cd an advanced installation mode where i can choose the packages to install and which to ignore or a guide on how to strip ubuntu down to its bare bones

1824
mouse	keyboard
browsers like most desktop applications generally leave input details to the operating system so they only see mouse or keyboard events

1840
sudo	passwd
enter sudo update-grub enter your passwd if necessary and wait for it to finish

1844
kde	gnome
of course gnome and i m sure kde have nice shortcuts and the ability to set them up how you want but that becomes a problem because in a lot of cases the keyboard ends out conflicting with built-in program behavior

debian is the rock upon which ubuntu is built

1944
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
so ubuntu is a linux distribuition derived from debian

1946

ubuntu is based on debian

1946
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu has in contrast to debian a regular release schedule and is more focused on stability and the needs of end users

1947
ubuntu	debian
- ubuntu was once considered a flavor of debian and that s where it s roots are

1947
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
debian in my opinion - back when ubuntu came about - was more of a start towards desktop linux and still had it s roots very much in servers

1947
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu project took what debian had going for it package management philosophy etc and spearheaded on the linux for humans and not for servers campaign and here we are today

1950
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu the os is built on the foundation of debian

1950
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu shares many of the packages and components of debian

1950
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu s goal is to be a user friendly linux distributions for those unfamiliar with linux in general

1950
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu has a strong focus on usability and ease of installation whereas debian is known for relatively strict adherence to the unix and free software philosophies and will sacrifice user friendliness in favour of those ideals

folder	directory
they will only have access to a specified directory except for the user root who can view modify delete all files and or folder

1971
ubuntu	debian
instead of spending time making installation of tarballs easier it would be more beneficial overall to spend it packaging the software for debian ubuntu

1971
ubuntu	debian
not only will this enhance the offerings of debian based distributions such as ubuntu it will also correctly install dependencies

1978
ubuntu	debian
the desktop has always been this way -- i guess it s because it was a debian machine before and i installed ubuntu without reformatting home .

ubuntu	debian
boot colinux with the debian with backports image and after boot mount the ubuntu partition in my case dev hda7

2080
ubuntu	debian
this script should of course be created in the etc init.d directory on the ubuntu partition and not on the debian with backports image

2080
ubuntu	debian
finally you will have to setup colinux so it boots using the ubuntu partition instead of the debian with backports image this is done by setting a boot partition in the default.colinux.xml file in my case it pointed to dev hda8

i ve got samba installed on ubuntu 10.04 and am about to configure it using webmin but i just realized i don t know the best place to create a file share on a linux system

2113
folder	directory
often configurations are done that allow every user to have a public folder in their home directory

2114
filesystems	ntfs
if the ubuntu partition created by wubi as a file in windows ntfs filesystems is very fragmented it is a quite large file then it would take a lot of movements by the disk head and hence slow down the boot time

2119
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is debian based and therefore uses .deb packages to install

2127
google-chrome	firefox
i d like to change the web browser shown on the application launcher from firefox to google-chrome

ubuntu	linux
it just wouldn t be worth their time to develop and support software starcraft 2 to run on ubuntu or any other flavor of linux

en-us applewebkit 533.4 khtml like gecko google-chrome 5.0.375.126 safari 533.4

2551
google-chrome	firefox
flash might also be the problem but it might as well be that google-chrome doesn t yes fully support the flash plugin - if firefox doesn t crash at the same pages it s properly not a flash bug since they use the same plugin

2571
ubuntu	linux
start from a working linux system preferably a recent ubuntu installation disc which is at the same time a live cd

2571
ubuntu	linux
in almost all cases that s just the linux partition where you ve installed ubuntu

2593

2704
vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate
if vim is not a requirement in the title you said vim but in the text you said how to clone textmate in ubuntu you should take a shot on emacs

if you haven t done it before just take your time and carefully read all the pop-up dialog and messages before pressing yes

2888
ubuntu	linux

2892
vim	textmate
fuzzy finder was written by someone returning to vim from textmate

2912
kde	gnome
duplicity s command line can be intimidating but there are many frontends to duplicity from command line duply to gnome deja-dup to kde time-drive

2920

i dont mean the sudo passwd prompt but the message will be downloaded and configrated xxx kb continue

2927
mouse	keyboard
once installed they won t have a keyboard or mouse connected but will have a fixed ip on the local network

2954
filesystems	ntfs
as far as filesystems go ntfs support in ubuntu is much better than ext- n support in windows

2965

2988
rpm	yum
can i use yum - or another rpm package management tool

obviously redhat fedora centos use different package names to ubuntu so you re likely going to run into a whole load of pain

3010

if i had a corporate-issued laptop that i wanted to use to run ubuntu but i didn t think i would get meaningful support from the it department i d buy my own hard disk put their the corporation s hard disk in my desk drawer and then install ubuntu on my disk

3012
automake	autotools
in most cases it is an autotools mess when debuild -s was called one of the autoconf automake scripts was modified and this modification won t apply anymore

3014
ubuntu	debian
and if not it is probably worth going through the trouble of compiling it from source into the debian package format that ubuntu uses as well

3029
versioning	upgrade
you might also need a sudo apt-get upgrade in there too if you already have old versioning of those packages installed

3062
ubuntu	debian
eventhough ubuntu is a very nice community i ve not been flamed for n00bie questions yet i think that there is few incomplete documentation about the packaging process even debian s new maintainer guide is full of this topic is out of the scope of this document lines

3086

3110
ethernet	wireless
wicd tends to deal well with wireless and basic ethernet connectivity but doesn t yet support vpns dsl 3g cdma and many other features which are becoming more and more popular

3122
versioning	upgrade
this will tell dpkg to keep your modified versioning of the file in future package upgrade

3123
ethernet	wireless
wicd tends to deal well with wireless and basic ethernet connectivity but doesn t yet support vpns dsl 3g cdma and many other features which are becoming more and more popular

3162
stdout	stderr
which will pipe the stderr to stdout which should solve your problem

3181
vim	emacs
the two classic open source unix editors are gnu emacs and g vim and both work fine on ubuntu

3200
xfce	gnome
there is an xfce panel plugin that should make it possible to put most gnome panel applets into the xfce panel

3224
stdout	stderr
the file descriptors for stdout and stderr are left open

3224
stdout	stderr
anything written to stdout or stderr in this manner will be directed to the main server log

i can access bing.com in a freshly opened google-chrome or firefox - why is this not working

3268
ubuntu	linux

on current ubuntu 10.04 suspend-on-lid fn + f4 only works if some powermanagement-applet of kde gnome is running

3299
bazaar	git
the scripts update local bazaar and git repositories

3299
jobs	cron
how to make sure the internet is up before running specific cron jobs

x86	64bit
then yes amd64 is one generic name for the x86 64bit architecture

3433
versioning	upgrade
if you re using grub legacy if you upgrade from a versioning of ubuntu before 9.10 please see the grub page in the ubuntu wiki for details on how to edit your boot grub menu.list to accomplish the same as above

3441
ubuntu	linux
from my understanding the linux kernel and by proxy ubuntu ignores deadlocks

3446
ubuntu	debian
how does the ubuntu ppa build server works - does it just look at the distribution field in the most current changelog entry in the debian changelog file to determine for what distribution the package should be build

3446
ubuntu	debian
some ubuntu documents talk about encoding the distribution name into the version number in the debian changelog file

3449
nautilus	fstab
nautilus uses gvfs to do mounting without modifying etc fstab

3471
xfce	kde
the most common other two used with ubuntu are kde and xfce

3472
kde	gnome
neither gnome kde or many other environments are trying to be the same as windows or mac as they believe there are user experience and accessibility issues with them

3474
xfce	kde
you can install either kde or xfce environments easily from an existing ubuntu installation or from their livecds

3474
kde	gnome
note that kubuntu-desktop in particular will bring in many applications libraries as dependencies since it uses the kde equivalents of a lot of gnome software koffice rather than evolution amarok rather than banshee etc

3475
ati	nvidia
i contacted system76 and they said they regularly offer both ati and nvidia on and off and that ati cards give more bang for the buck

3486
ubuntu	openbsd
openbsd pioneered making this popular with privilege separation of various daemons most notably openssh so you re using this on ubuntu now

3486
freebsd	linux
the capsicum project showed how this could be done more fully on freebsd with a capability system and hopefully at some point the linux kernel devs will stop fighting over which security model is best and just go with something that becomes near-universally available for web-browsers to rely upon rather than the blunt hammer that is the suid wrapper which allows for chroot pseudo-sandboxes

3490
voip	sip
most voip providers that use sip the standard protocol for voip work fine with open source applications used in ubuntu and there are also hardware-based sip solutions

3502
versioning	upgrade
i m running ubuntu 9.10 can t upgrade due to some applications being incompatible with later versioning with all updates installed

3508
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i know linux mint comes prebundled with it but i d much prefer to stick to the ubuntu line what can i say

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
you can configure that to move tile windows open menus go back or open new tabs in firefox google-chrome opera and so on

3512
ubuntu	opensuse
the printer did work in opensuse but for some reason it does not print in ubuntu 10.04

3518
google-chrome	firefox
to be more specific both google-chrome and firefox stop being able to load sites like google.com

3534
post	get
also you can run update-grub and check if you get any errors - pls post the result of that also

3540
kde	gnome
it is then automatically called by etc acpi lid.sh if no gnome kde power-manager running

3565
ubuntu	debian
if you are using debian ubuntu paste sudo apt-get install parcellite no quotes into a terminal ha ha or use synaptic to install it

reconnect your keyboard and mouse

3596
ubuntu	linux
as a linux ubuntu newbie what is lvm and what is it used for

3599
xen	raid
i don t know raid setups but i think you are forgetting the problem that you need package changes to boot a xen system in an ordinary way

3650
ffmpeg	handbrake
you can use pretty much any converter avidemux handbrake or even ffmpeg directly

3659
versioning	upgrade
is it at all possible to downgrade from one versioning of ubuntu to a previous versioning without doing a re-install similar to the way you can upgrade

3690
photoshop	paint.net
i have used photoshop in the past and more recently have mostly used paint.net for windows

3706
folder	directory
font files that are placed in the hidden .fonts directory of your home folder will automatically be available

3721
folder	directory
create a folder called .fonts in your home directory if you don t already have one drop the font file in there run gimp job done

3729
versioning	upgrade
if your having multiple issues after upgrade to 10.04 i recommend doing a backup and reinstalling a fresh versioning of it

3752
pop-up	dialog
when you choose to share a folder the install dialog for samba pop-up

3755
folder	directory
if you install font s in folder .fonts in your home directory you may need to run fc-cache -rv not sudo in order to cache fonts in your home directory as well

3760
bash	zsh
or you could do crazy history expansion tested in zsh perhaps in bash as well

3762
bash	zsh
history expansion is less useful with shells like bash and zsh that have powerful command line editing

3773
mouse	keyboard
my mouse wheel can go left right and i want to map this to go left right in my workspaces but i also want the keyboard shortcut to remain

3775
solaris	aix
not sure about aix but i remember this as an old korn shell trick on the solaris boxes i used to administer

3785
kde	gnome
another goal was to be as independent as possible from a special desktop environment like kde or gnome - geany only requires the gtk2 runtime libraries

3787
switching	screens
just wanted to add that you can also use your regular vertical mouse wheel axis to switching workspaces by adding mouse4 and mouse5 actions on the left and right screens edges

3798

4254
komodo	geany
i m using both komodo edit and geany

ati	nvidia
in terms of hardware i think at this moment ati is providing more bang for your buck with many cheap cards outperforming nvidia cards of the same value

4308
ati	nvidia
however while ati s open-source drivers are continuing to improve i don t think they nor the binary fglrx driver compare with nvidia s proprietary driver -- yet

4313
redhat	fedora
the reason i was using fedora in the first place was that i was using redhat at work

4488
ubuntu	debian
if you use ubuntu 10.10 you can add unofficial packages from the debian multimedia project and install their ffmpeg version you should not do this if you use ubuntu 10.04 there are too many conflicts with older packages

4549
google-chrome	firefox
i couple this with flashblock for firefox though there is a similar add-on with the same name for google-chrome to avoid unwanted flash ads flash-storage user-tracking and exploits

4562
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and linux is supposed to be rock-solid because it s usually rock-solid

4568
jobs	cron
less experienced users might find this easier to use than setting up cron jobs

4596
ubuntu	linux
this error message is coming from linux but not from ubuntu it s from expressgate which is an appliance linux distribution available on high-end asus motherboards

4596
versioning	upgrade
another thing that has a tiny but nonzero chance of working is to do a bios upgrade even if it s to a versioning you already have

4597
tunnel	vpn
if it does not work the best thing i can think of is to add a static route defining the vpn s address range as the destination and the vpn tunnel exit address and port as the gateway

4606
versioning	upgrade
however the upgrade command says that there are no upgrade available and nginx is still the old versioning

4611

4825
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is linux fedora is linux slackware is linux etc.....

4828
kde	gnome
there are multiple distributions that package up the linux kernel and lots of gnu software and x software gnome or kde software etc and produce an easy to install and maintain operating system

4829
ubuntu	linux
a linux distribution like ubuntu is a kernel plus a lot of useful software including an installer command line interface editors gui etc

4838
ubuntu	linux
yes ubuntu does use the linux kernel and the gnu userspace

4841
ubuntu	linux
after all how to properly install flash player on linux ubuntu

4869
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu has one special upstream debian which ubuntu derives from

4869
ubuntu	debian
so they are ubuntu s upstream for many packages though for some packages like the kernel ubuntu packages directly from the upstream project though for the majority of packages debian is the upstream to ubuntu and the project that is packaged is upstream to debian

4869
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
downstreams of ubuntu would be ubuntu derived distributions like linux mint

4872
lan	intranet	google-chrome	firefox
basically i want firefox to use eth0 because it is the university lan network and i have to go to intranet sites the other one is a wifi network open to the internet and i want to bind it to google-chrome

post	get
would you please post here a link to a howto if you get it done

4892
kde	gnome
it s compatible with metacity and kwin the defaults for gnome and kde

4898
dpkg	apt
there s perhaps one better solution an application that behaved like apt and dpkg but for interacting with pypi where pip and easy_install get most of their mojo

4899
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
i use universe with kubuntu but have debian lenny running with gnome installed separately so anything on kde or gnome would work

4900
folder	directory
then you can right click on a folder or in the blank space below the files and open a terminal with the path set to that directory

in order to remove the anchor icon from docky you must first upgrade to the most recent versioning

4975
vmware	virtualbox
because of this problem in wine to do the firmware upgrade you ll need to either setup a virtual machine with virtualbox or vmware or perhaps more simply borrow someone else s computer

4997
ati	nvidia
you didn t mention your video hardware but if you ve got ati or nvidia you could try using the proprietary video driver if your card is supported by it

4997
versioning	upgrade
or try upgrading to a newer versioning the x-updates ppa contains upgrade drivers

5005
folder	directory
remove the original files from your home directory then create a link from the file in its new home under your dropbox folder to home directory

5005
folder	directory
you can do this by dragging and dropping the file folder to your home directory name while holding the alt key and select create link

5005
folder	directory
repeat step 3 above on new machine - copy links from dropbox-synchronized folder to home directory

5025
ati	nvidia
if you re using proprietary video drivers ati or nvidia and the new machine shouldn t use the same driver move media disk9 etc x11 xorg.conf to media disk9 etc x11 xorg.conf.old-machine otherwise you may not be able to boot to a gui in the new machine

5026
mouse	keyboard
once you set your keyboard shortcuts you can use this program to assign simple mouse gestures to them

5071
kde	gnome
i am having both gnome and kde on my system

5071
kde	gnome
my gnome desktop is working perfectly but in kde here is no sound being generated

5084
rar	zip
midnight commander as well as all norton and total commanders i used to use with dos and windows provide a very pleasant facility of stepping into archives tar.gz zip 7z rar etc. and other containers as iso cd images and working with them much like plane directories

5095
ubuntu	linux
i m a ubuntu 10.04 user who is looking for a way to for example make my computer type a + character when i hold down the windows key i think it s called super in linux world and press the k key

this also allows us to easily browser the source of any ubuntu or debian package on-line via bazzar.launchpad.net

5134
mouse	keyboard
the install worked fine but the mouse and keyboard both of which is usb are unbearably laggy

5140
mouse	keyboard
and i do this frequently because i prefer using a full-sized external keyboard but have not enough only 3 usb ports to plug-in it alongside with a mouse a 3g modem and an external hard flash drive

5146
mouse	keyboard
if you use compiz you can then use the commands plugin along with xte to simulate keyboard presses and make alt + f1 be any mouse corner press you want

5146
mouse	keyboard
oh and don t forget about the mouse gesture program easystroke which allows you to run any keyboard command script etc. with simple mouse movements rather than having to click your desktop at all

5161
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
in windows kde and xfce this can be easily configured but in gnome ubuntu 10.10 i couldn t find where to set this up -

5207
webkit	blink
since version 28 all chromium based browsers use a forked version of webkit called blink

5212
ubuntu	linux
since our hard disks are overflowing regularly i wonder whether there is such a thing like ntfs compression for ubuntu linux for compressing these files transparently for the clients

5219
folder	directory
if you delete desktop and don t assign it your home directory becomes the desktop folder

5255
kde	gnome
yes i am a exclusive gnome user and krusader is a kde app but it is worth it

5257
ubuntu	debian
today october 6th 2010 ubuntu 10.10 is in feature definition freeze debian import freeze feature freeze user interface freeze beta freeze documentation string freeze final freeze kernel freeze and past the translation deadlines in both the non-language pack and language pack editions as the release schedule details

5259
ubuntu	debian
on the other hand since the granularity of a debian ubuntu upgrade is a package even a single byte change induces one or more package upgrades

5268
versioning	upgrade
lucid was another story but if you want 10.10 and are going to upgrade anyway the home desktop versioning is the only one i can speak for i say go for it

5275
rar	zip
now you can handle cab files like zip or rar files

5277

it s available as a debian ubuntu package just run sudo apt-get install wondershaper to install it

5377
ubuntu	debian
on debian and or fedora are much more up to date as in more than a year if not two than those i see on the ubuntu reps

5377
ubuntu	debian
to bypass the ubuntu reps and use the packages from the debian reps and run unto dependency hell

5379
ubuntu	linux
i love the way ubuntu linux is so configurable

5381
ubuntu	debian
you also might be better off installing atlas from source instead of relying on the debian or ubuntu maintainers

5382
ubuntu	debian
libatlas in ubuntu 10.10 is at upstream version 3.8.3 the same as in debian and fedora

5382
ubuntu	debian
backporting lib packages from debian or ubuntu development releases can be a tricky proposition as you would likely have to rebuild any of libatlas reverse dependencies against the new version as well

5385
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome and firefox at least the flash plugin runs under the following guise if you re using flashplayer-nonfree

5394
folder	directory
even though the postgresql 8.4.5 server and client are installed the postgresql directory in etc folder is missing

5396
bazaar	git
the bazaar dvcs seems to be left far behind git and mercurial at least in terms of adoption and overall mindshare in the vcs space

5405
bazaar	git
in the viewpoint of canonical git and other source control tools didn t cut it for them so they produced bazaar which suites their needs to a t

5405
bazaar	git
personally i don t like bazaar - so for the projects i interact with i export the bazaar repository to git then import my changes back in

5435
google-chrome	firefox
will the settings of application such as the bookmarks for firefox and for google-chrome be preserved

5463

closing a tab in firefox or google-chrome using the middle-mouse button is for me a great feature

5589
installation	upgrade
if you ve customized your installation in any other way configured system settings installed more than a couple of additional programs etc. upgrade

5590

kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
yes a system upgrade will upgrade all packages including kde and gnome no matter whether you re using ubuntu or kubuntu

5605
filesystems	ntfs
attleast one thing what point s out is ntfs-3g that is ntfs filesystems driver not filesystems itself

5625
versioning	upgrade
update-manager -d is the command to upgrade to development trunk versioning of ubuntu

ubuntu	linux
if you run the ubuntu installer either off a cd or usb drive there is an option in the partitioner to overwrite an existing linux distro with the new one

5684
mint	live-cd
2 after booting mint as a live-cd

5684
ubuntu	linux
after that install ubuntu from within windows using wubi or from live-cd the latter required rearranging harddrive partitions most likely shrinking windows and adding linux root partition plus swap partition at least

5684
kde	gnome
if you use a different desktop now say kde whereas you used to use gnome it will build default configs of what was not there before

5684
ubuntu	mint
a good bootloader when running win7 or winvista and ubuntu mint is easybcd which is administered from windows and is free

i have also tried a program called novell client for linux but it didn t fully support ubuntu it was butt ugly the latest release was made in 2004

5763
versioning	upgrade
i would like to know how to upgrade from my current versioning of ubuntu to the next stable from the command line interface

5768
installation	upgrade
i think that in the upgrade to 10.04 they found that the existing wireless drivers were conflicting with other libraries that the devs wanted in 10.04 so they decided to actually remove the drivers for these wireless cards in the installation upgrade

5771
youtube	vimeo
for youtube vimeo and blip.tv you could use my flashvideoreplacer extension which replaces the embedded video with available mp4 in order to play it with other plugins

5855
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade from 10.10 beta - am i now running the official non development versioning

5859

when i click on a link to an email address in firefox or google-chrome a welcome to evolution screen appears

5892
kde	gnome	switching	screens

ubuntu	linux
what video editing software would you recommend on ubuntu or linux in general

5925
gmail	hotmail
desktop webmail supports following services gmail yahoo hotmail and zoho

5933
disk	ram
also it s recommended that the swap space is maximum twice the amount of ram depending upon the amount of hard disk space available for the system because of diminishing returns

5933
disk	ram
the diminishing returns means that if you need more swap space then twice your ram size you d better add more ram as hard disk drive hdd access is about 10â³ slower then ram access so something that would take 1 second suddenly takes more than 15 minutes

5934
youtube	vimeo
easily add sub-titles transitions and effects and then export your film to dvd youtube vimeo xbox 360 and many other common formats

5936
filesystems	btrfs
the new btrfs filesystems is an exception so if you re playing with that you ll need a swap partition

5960
versioning	upgrade
i was thinking of issuing updated versioning of this in our current repo with a few upgrade scripts to be run from postinst

i think you can export a pdf file in indesign and then import it in inkscape

mouse	keyboard
a few weeks ago an update overwrote this file with an attempted fix that didn t for many work and it took a while for me to realise why my mouse and keyboard stopped working again

6164
ubuntu	linux
fortunately ubuntu has got to the stage where i can get online with all my equipment as a novice user and i can now start learning and improving my linux skills

6166
folder	directory
gnome-do has an official plugin called files and folder which indexes any directory you add to its configuration

6177
installation	upgrade
the desktop cd has all those packages already installed as part of the squashfs image which is convenient for doing new installation but unusable for doing upgrade with

6180
versioning	upgrade
i don t believe you can just upgrade to a 64 bit versioning of ubuntu you would have to reformat the partition and install the 64 bit versioning from the x64 live cd

6181
versioning	upgrade
the alternate cd can be used to upgrade your ubuntu versioning

6188
kde	gnome
i have never had much success in making kde apps look integrated into the gnome desktop

6191
ati	nvidia
this is not normal and looks like to be related to an issue with the proprietary nvidia ati drivers

6204
dia	visio
dia can open visio s xml format vdx

6246
mouse	keyboard
there s quite a few text macro applications for linux as well as some applications for recording and re-running various keyboard and mouse events as needed

6268
versioning	upgrade
if you run sudo apt-get update and then attempt to either upgrade or install the nginx package with ppa nginx stable added by add-apt-repository you should end up with versioning 0.8.52-0ppa1

6273
ati	nvidia
edit clarification i m really looking for hardware other than nvidia ati

6288
ati	nvidia
why are you discounting nvidia and ati hardware

6288
ati	nvidia
all modern ati and nvidia hardware will drive two displays

although both os are based on unix but mac os x apps are designed to run on its mac os x platform and coding while ubuntu is based on debian there are relatively no common factors

versioning	upgrade
i would like to learn how to upgrade packages in older ubuntu versioning to what s available in current versioning

6364
vmware	virtualbox
you d do a lot better to download virtualbox free or vmware workstation not free and use that instead

6376
folder	directory
then you could create a directory where you re going to test this release of firefox unpack the downloaded package i assume it is in your home downloads folder and launch it

6395
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
the ubuntu-mozilla-daily ppa also upgrade your default firefox installation with the latest testing versioning of firefox 3.x and other mozilla applications

6395
toolbar	tabs
so firefox 4 still looks very similar to 3.6 except for a few changes like for example the ability to place tabs on top view toolbar tabs on top

6410
folder	directory
by default in ubuntu desktop all files and directory you create are readable by everybody so you can set your documentroot to a directory inside your home folder for example

6424
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this problem has happened to me since ubuntu 10.04 linux mint 9 and now 10.10 it works fine on win7 but i don t really want to boot there

geany	scite
this actually works with most scintilla-based editors including scite and geany

6471
versioning	upgrade
on the other hand if you like me want to have the newest software or just a piece of software that is not available for your versioning it is ok to upgrade

6478
versioning	upgrade
if what you mean is that you want apt to prefer a certain package versioning over another keep older versioning and not install upgrade to new versioning take a look at

6560
folder	directory
you simply extract to a folder in your home directory and run the client program

anjuta	kdevelop	codeblocks	kdevelop	codeblocks	anjuta
just googling kdevelop vs codeblocks gives a bunch of results that compares the two as well as some others like anjuta eclipse and netbeans

6657
filesystems	hfs+
the development of a mac ubuntu installer is currently blocked by the lack of journalling write support in the hfs+ filesystems driver

6657
filesystems	hfs+
as mubi obviously needs to write to the mac filesystems and most macs come with hfs+ journalling turned on this functionality needs to be present in the linux kernel before development work on mubi can begin in earnest

6659
pull	push
reading the manual pages it seems to be leading me to believe it is only possible to configure these utilities to pull from the client to the server whereas i thought it was possible to schedule these to push to the server from the client

6671
mouse	trackpad
the trackpad still works and as soon as i use it the problem with the mouse goes away

6680
sudo	passwd
sudo is usually used for cli though and gksu is the graphical passwd promt that does the same thing

i ve set up a host directory to share with the guest via virutulbox s shared folder

6691

please post here if you get any answers

sudo	passwd
root administrative task can only be done by using the user s passwd with command sudo or gksu

6704
ubuntu	debian
this answer concern debian but it is probable that will work for ubuntu also and in any case can be a useful bit of information

6712
sudo	passwd
in order to perform root administrator operations you have to use the sudo command in a terminal or any gui equivalent of it these will ask you for your passwd and then perform the requested privileged operation and only that one

6712
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu or gnu linux node where you have a graphical x11 display

6727
chown	chmod
use chown to change ownership and chmod to change rights

6727
folder	directory

apparently setting security locks you out of the directory even at the file system level not just via ftp - when i look at the permissions tab of my htaccess folder for example the owner is set to the ftp username

8729
folder	directory
i can ftp but unfortunately no matter what i set my default remote directory to in my ftp program it takes me inside my htdocs folder and won t let me go up one level

8739

you can then use the folder in your home directory as you would any other directory since its in your home folder and owned and created by you there shouldn t be any permissions problems

if you want to dual boot run windows and ubuntu side by side use the windows disk management tool to create a big enough partition for your linux install

if a new versioning of the ssh daemon is installed as part of the upgrade the daemon will be restarted

8887
versioning	upgrade
by starting a separate sshd which is not handled by the init system and thus won t be restarted during the upgrade it is ensured that the old versioning of sshd will still be running even if the new versioning fails to start

8887
daemons	systemd
thus you can still log into the systemd and see what caused the daemons to break

this is apart from the fact that you don t have to reinstall ubuntu when the next versioning is released you just let update manager perform the upgrade for you

8994
kde	gnome	folder	dir
i don t use gnome nor kde desktops because my system isn t as fast as they require it to be but even when i don t use them a desktop folder is always in my home dir i ve delete it several times before but it s again there when i reboot the system what do i need to do in order to delete it for ever

if you only use them as storage for ubuntu systems i d suggest you use a linux filesystem ext3 4 because it will be faster more stable

9104

put your tmp directory into a ram disk

9115
kate	kde
kate has this features but unfortunately it brings with it several packages if you re not running kde already and this is not what you asked for

9138
xfce	kde
whereas the kde and especially xfce people have other things on their agendas such as performance xfce ãœber-modern technologies kde and so on

9162
mouse	keyboard
i ve tried several command-line apps which send keyboard and mouse messages to x but they all seem to only place the mouse in relation to the screen

9214
dpkg	aptitude
i know how to copy home dir and reinstall system with preservation of this dir i m just curios if there is way to rescue sys by working with apt-get aptitude and dpkg

9241
ubuntu	debian
for debian there is apt-spy maybe it s possible to adapt it to ubuntu it would need to use a different mirror list of course

9267
voip	sip
but of course there are several alternative voip applications that use the standard sip protocol including empathy and ekiga which is supported by most voip providers except skype...

9277
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
at login after entering your username you can select which one you want to boot gnome kde xfce ... so it s always possible to go back to gnome even without rebooting

9278
kde	kubuntu
i m not sure if that s really what you meant when you said kde on top of an ubuntu installation but kubuntu is little more than kde+ubuntu

9278
kde	gnome
i might be wrong but i think only the settings stored under .gnome2 won t be loaded by kde they are gnome settings after all

9278
kde	gnome
you can keep using gnome regularly and never choose kde again in the session manager

9283
vmware	virtualbox
wubi creates a virtual disk the same as any vm like virtualbox or vmware which can be defragmented within windows just like any other file

9303

man uses less to display the manual page which in turn uses vim keybindings while info uses emacs keybindings and standard emacs commands for search quitting etc

9332
kde	gnome
there are actually other documentation systems in use besides man and info gnome and kde have their own html-based system etc

9334
dpkg	aptitude
when you run a software installation command aptitude apt-get synaptic or the ubuntu software centre the file var lib dpkg lock is locked to prevent several instances of the command to run concurrently

9334
ubuntu	debian
although the dpkg package installation system used in debian and ubuntu is quite robust and will do the right thing even if an installation is canceled or interrupted it is usually safer to let the installation finish and then remove the installed package afterwards

9343
min	max
whenever i try clicking anywhere on the calendar including the min max close the entire window jumps up or down making it impossible to select anything forcing me to restart evolution just to get back to my inbox

9348
versioning	upgrade
if it is not your desired versioning you will also not receive it with this release as there will be no major versioning upgrade within a release

9348
ubuntu	debian
you could also try to find the newest version in the debian unstable branch or wait for ubuntu to implement backports for maverick

9352
versioning	upgrade
the correct procedure for updating to the latest versioning available in the repositories is to run sudo apt-get update to update the available software list and then sudo apt-get upgrade to actually install the new versioning of the packages

9361
kde	gnome
if you like kde you can still install and use most gnome applications without any ill effect

9369

pop-up for group buttons without open windows is not shown anymore instead there is an option in preference dialog to show tooltips for group buttons without windows

chown	sudo	chown	mkdir
sudo adduser user some-project and create a directory for them to collaborate in sudo mkdir -p srv git some-project and then make the directory writable and setgid for the group sudo chown root coders srv git some-project

9663
google-chrome	firefox
it really puzzles me that any google search counts far more results in firefox or google-chrome than in chromium

9663
google-chrome	firefox
google says about 1.460.000 results for natty narwhal in firefox or google-chrome but only 914.000 results in chromium

9674
google-chrome	firefox
for the same search i get 1 680 000 in google-chrome 1 690 000 in firefox

9676
ubuntu	linux
to avoid these it is imo better to have a proper install of ubuntu either in a dual boot setup or if you don t need windows too much let windows run in a virtual machine within ubuntu and share files that are stored in the linux file system

9679
mouse	keyboard
when it is i usually want to use only this monitor because i have it hooked up to an external keyboard mouse also

nautilus	fstab
see man mount and man fstab for more information. note that this will cause duplicate entries for every affected drive in nautilus and perhaps other file managers as well

folder	directory
i would like everyone s to have a folder in the home directory to accessible over the internet w password protected

9740
subtract	add
if you add buffers and cache and then subtract that from the used column you ll get the second line under used the line that starts with - + buffers cache which shows about 2.3g 2384512 in use which matches the reported memory in use that system monitor is reporting it is ignoring the buffers cached because those will go away to make room for more processes

9757
rss	feed
which is the most up to date and modern rss feed reader for my ubuntu desktop

9762
opera	firefox
i prefer the reader to be embedded in the browser as an extension firefox or as a built-in feature opera

opml	feed
it lets you read articles on the original site while keeping track of which one you re reading on the feed without interruption you need to experience that to understand the difference it makes does intelligent learning and filtering can import from google reader and opml and has an overall well thought out user experience

9808
ubuntu	debian
since ubuntu is a debian derivative i thought maybe it s possible

9815
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is derived from the debian unstable branch which is the in-progress and most up-to-date version of debian

9815
ubuntu	debian
if you tried installing a package from debian unstable it might work but there should already be an ubuntu equivalent that you should use instead

9815
ubuntu	debian
if you tried using packages from any of the older debian releases you would be getting old versions and would run into dependency errors that would either stop you from installing or break your official ubuntu packages

9819
spaces	delimiter
my current guess is the following delimiter by a single spaces

9820
mouse	keyboard
all that fine but the laptop is really hot i can feel it in the keyboard mouse pad is painful to touch and the fan is always spinning

9823
ati	nvidia
i ve also heard rumors though seen no evidence myself that the opensource graphics drivers for nvidia ati do not support power-saving mode which would lead to lower battery life

9825
kde	gnome
you can then decide during login if you want to use the gnome desktop or the kde desktop

9834
installation	upgrade
one advantage of having a local mirror when compared to a cache is that installation upgrade will always be fast for the packages that are available on the mirror while when using a cache the first person who needs a package will have to wait until it s downloaded

9843
google-chrome	firefox
even doesn t matter if it applies for firefox or google-chrome

9862
gtk	gio
there is a gio patch submitted upstream a gtk patch for appmenu support which are not upstream so you would lose the global menu

9895
ubuntu	opensuse
i think it means that ubuntu will not be splitted to 2 editions enterprise full and home reduced like rhel fedora sled opensuse or even win7ultimate win7 starter

9901
gtk	clutter
i would suggest you also read up on the future of gtk 3.x clutter and related technologies

9903
udp	tcp
you can install the package iptraf which gives you realtime monitoring of various tcp and udp information

9909
ati	nvidia
i ll talk about how my setup works with nvidia but i don t have the hardware to comment on ati and intel support so hopefully someone will post seperate answers for those

9909
ati	nvidia
using the open source ati driver with randr you setup from monitor preferences see screenshot then the same result is achieved as with nvidia twinview

9946
sudo	passwd
you can configure sudo per user or group to allow all or only certain commands either with or without passwd

9950
disk	ram
yeah i m suggesting you give up 300megs of ram and a gig of disk space to run ubuntu server from within windows

9950
vmware	virtualbox
most modern virtualisation systems like virtualbox and vmware allow you to pass the vm an entire disk or partition so that s what you d do

9993
hide	show
pressing escape key while the system boots will hide the plymouth splash screen and show you the boot messages

10005

10031
kubuntu	gnome
is the difference between ubuntu gnome +unity more less pronounced than the difference between ubuntu and kubuntu

10045
switching	screens
that allows with one command to switching on off the extended screens

10045
switching	screens
switching second screens on as extended screens disper -e

10057
ubuntu	debian
as mentioned ubuntu is really source code derived but since ubuntu and debian use slightly different compilers kernels and library versions installing debian packages on ubuntu can result in a lot of weird behaviors crashes corruption etc

10125
vmware	virtualbox
to convert your virtualbox image to vmware see this discussion didn t try it

10168
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way of switching tabs in google-chrome or firefox by scrolling the mouse-wheel while keeping the right mouse-button pressed

10168
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome or firefox with tab-wheel-scroll extension you can switch tabs by scrolling the wheel while hovering the pointer over the tab-bar

10172
put	get
if you want to find other interesting commands to put in those fields for short cuts why not get your geek on at

10174
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu have been using the go-oo patched version of ooo for quite some time the website link for ooo in software center points to the go-oo site and according to the go-oo frontpage go-oo will be discontinued now that there is the document foundation libreoffice

10217

10240
ubuntu	linux
remove conflicting flash plugins from ubuntu linux systems and install the appropriate version according to system architecture

10256
folder	directory
i ve no idea if this actually works so i certainly wouldn t run it from anything but the least important directory you have make a testing folder with some known ascii files in

10259
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu s this applied to linux in general tbh strength is that it meets the requirements of the majority of users with a footprint considerably smaller than that of windows and in fact i think during each development cycle canonical should be finding ways to streamline the size of ubuntu not increase it

10268
installation	upgrade
my system has been upgrade since 9.10 so it should be the same on nearly every ubuntu installation

10275
ubuntu	debian
why not give instructions to add ubuntu repositories to debian for this

10275
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	debian
something like apt-get install --no-install-recommends ubuntuone-client wouldn t work because as soon as you add the ubuntu repository to a debian install it would try to upgrade all packages to the latest versioning

10286
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	xfce	kubuntu
will we have a gnome version of ubuntu available for download like kubuntu is for kde and xubuntu is for xfce

10318
ubuntu	linux
the linux kernel in ubuntu 10.04 is currently upstream version 2.6.32.21 with many ubuntu specific additions

10330
installation	upgrade
i sense more frustration to come because if you upgrade successfully to maverick then you will be forced to upgrade every six months till the next lts or do a fresh installation at some point when you could just upgrade once from lts to lts

10345
folder	directory
you choose folder view and set the location as a different folder from in your home directory

10346
installation	upgrade
i know that you asked about upgrade but they don t always work out and fresh installation are always better because in my experience they never fail

10348
kde	kubuntu
from kubuntu s stand point keep true to kde but from yours change it to suit yourself

10352
ubuntu	linux
if it won t work through wine or its versions like the commercially-supported crossover linux then i don t know of another way to get that specific program to work in ubuntu

10354

apart from loco teams you could also try your local lug linux user group or general computer club they might have a linux or ubuntu workgroup

10356
sudo	passwd
without the login passwd i cannot run sudo either

10363
ati	nvidia
according to i have a ati mobility radeon x600 nvidia geforce go 6600

10365
ati	nvidia
if you have an nvidia or ati amd graphics card then you can opt-in to the manufacturer-supplied drivers by going to system administration additional drivers

10365
ati	nvidia
i googled around and found that many tecra a4 models in fact have intel gma chipsets instead of nvidia or ati

10366
ubuntu	linux
in my case most linux and ubuntu users i met was through a foss community

10373
ubuntu	linux
i thought that there was no need to scan for viruses either in ubuntu or any linux distros until i found virus scanner packages clamtk and klamav in ubuntu software center yesterday

10376

therefore i recommend installing clam gnome or klam kde

10384
switching	screens
about half the time when i switching users or resume from standby or resume the screens goes blank black

debian	linux
personal anecdote i had a debian server running it had an uptime of 400 days and i wanted to get to 500 before restarting it to update the kernel i was being silly and too cocky about it being a linux system

10438
sudo	passwd
i have noticed that when i press the check button from the update manager in maverick it starts directly downloading the information on packages without asking me my passwd sudo verification like it used to be in 10.04 and before

10453
adium	ichat
pidgin adium and ichat should support it among others

10462

but if you have a nvidia or ati video card that could be the problem

10475

asus eeepc netbooks also come with a linux installer last time i heard but not sure if it was ubuntu they were using

10479
versioning	upgrade
the kernel versioning may change from 2.6.32.x to 2.6.31.y but not likely change to to say 2.6.32 unless you choose to upgrade the kernel yourself

10482
ubuntu	debian
to build and install kernel in ubuntu or any debian based system for that matter its best to use makepkg istead of the usual make make modules_install ..

you tagged your question with kde which is only installed by default in kubuntu

the mouse pointer would work at 1-2 fps and the keyboard would keep missing letters as i was typing them

10679

the problem started appearing when i plugged the mouse and keyboard directly into the computer rather than the usb-hub in the screen

redhat fedora cent has a slick little script called tmpwatch that you can easily pull-over to ubuntu

10756
ubuntu	linux
it seems to me that python 3.x is still rather unpopular in the linux ubuntu community

10760

you may want to search for such packages for ubuntu debian but it will more likely be for servers

10762
daemons	systemd
if so i d write a script to run after installing vmware tools and adjust systemd daemons then

10767
vmware	virtualbox
you ll need to make that grep -i vmware |virtualbox |xen or something similar look at the lshw output on virtualbox or xen to see what the exact strings are if you re using different virtualisation systems

10772
ubuntu	debian
i m not aware of any immediate plans for technical changes in revu and the new package submission process but one significant policy change for new packages in recent times is that the primarily recommended way to get a new package into ubuntu if you want to be the person who is responsible for it as opposed to team maintenance is now to do it through debian

10814
x86	64bit
ubuntu s supported architectures change over time but x86 32-bit i386 and x86 64bit amd64 are the most standard architectures with arm armel becoming a recent addition

from using all 3 major operating systems considering ubuntu as the third as the representative of linux i can tell you that ubuntu is very similar to mac os x in simplicity also i have noticed window dialogs tend to be remarkably similar to that of which we see in ubuntu

11398

if this isn t resolved then it won t enter debian and likely won t be included with ubuntu unless the distribution legality is clarified

if your desired package is open source and has a package maintainer in debian that is making sure to maintain it then it makes it s way into ubuntu automatically

umask	chmod
if not your user s uid from id and umask 000 if you wanted all users to have access or 077 for just the one specified by uid -- it s a mask so you put the opposite of what you d chmod as

12013
ubuntu	debian
i think fedora starts user accounts at 500 by default while debian ubuntu start them at 1000 so it s very likely that in one os you are user number 500 and in the other you are user number 1000

12015
disk	ram
since you are not looking after free disk space but rather free ram memory you can work around by not launching those applications in the first place

if you re only limited in ram and not in disk space you don t have to remove cups you can just not start it

gnome through nautilus and gvfs can mount network shares on login and this wouldn t be available for kde to access

12540

in your case assuming that you have backed up everything of importance on the windows partition simply remove it it will probably be the first partition with the ntfs filesystems

13091
ubuntu	debian
the downloads page has a separate deb file for each release of ubuntu or possibly debian

13091
ubuntu	debian
if you use one of the many derivative distributions of ubuntu or debian you ll need to figure out which ubuntu or debian version yours is based on

13091
ubuntu	debian
this file will typically be crafted to work on all recent versions of ubuntu or debian

13157
ubuntu	linux
having recently moved to linux ubuntu i m looking for a good editor and gnu emacs seems to fit the bill

13255
ubuntu	debian
what is the difference between a ubuntu and a debian

13261
ubuntu	debian
once your package is in debian it will be automatically imported into ubuntu

13261
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu use the same packaging system

13261
ubuntu	debian
binary packages .deb files for debian and ubuntu are not necessarily compatible but when you package for ubuntu and debian you upload source code so that it is built for different architectures

13261
ubuntu	debian
binary packages are built separately for debian and ubuntu

13262
kde	gnome
some kde applications start in full screen mode under gnome i ve never found out why sadly

this usr share icons humanity actions 22 mail-read.svg becomes svg humanity-actions-22-mail-read.svg meaning you can view them in one nautilus folder without having to traverse often cumbersome directory structures

13627
ubuntu	linux
the likelihood of it being included in ubuntu is mostly dependent on if the linux kernel as upstream includes the patch in the stable release 2.6.38 which will go into natty narwhal

13669
ati	nvidia
that would happen because first game 3d application math application developers who target ati nvidia would be indirectly putting pressure on them to provide a good experience for linux customers as well as regular users equally and with the bottom line falling from under them the big two would scramble to make a better experience

13888
folder	directory

13900
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
normally it s quite hard but challenging and satisfying too to configure and customize but a great customization ready to use of this windows system always in the ubuntu flavour has been made by the guys at linux mint

13906

i googled and found this and other solutions in forums but these address only the kde on gnome scenario

14892
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
unfortunately as far as i know the way xfce stores it s .desktop files is the same as the way gnome stores them whereas kde stores them in a separate folder within usr share applications

14892

this is why the separation of kde gnome as described in the post you link to is much easier to do en-mass

there is no simple way to separate xfce apps from gnome especially since it s often a matter of opinion what you want to see

in ubuntu you are not expected to use a root user with a passwd most applications requiring root privileges will be invoked using sudo gksudo the user launching those apps will need to have sudo privileges and you must use the regular user passwd

the binaries are smaller as is the memory footprint and if you have a small disk footprint system its likely you won t even have 4gb of ram to take advantage of the 64-bit memory management

when i attempt to watch vimeo or youtube videos the playback is so choppy that it can t be watched

15220
ubuntu	debian
the problem is that i want to find the ubuntu changes from debian mainline not from original source

15220

that way i can use debian mainline with some of the customizations that ubuntu provides ubuntu does a lot of things well but i think it is over-simplifying some things.

ubuntu repositories in debian will create problems if they will load at all

you can then use a different passwd for running sudo the user s passwd

versioning	upgrade
after kernel updates a new entry is added to the grub menu.you can remove the older one if you want.however most experienced users will advise you to keep at least one spare entry in case something goes wrong with an upgrade and you need to boot an older kernel versioning for troubleshooting purposes

15343
ubuntu	debian
i think the prime consideration and comparison between debian stable and an ubuntu lts is security and general package updates

15343
next	except
the security team tries to support a stable distribution for about one year after the next stable distribution has been released except when another stable distribution is released within this year

15343
ubuntu	debian
when you have more than a handful of servers or just some applications that can t afford any downtime for testing upgrades or just don t have the time to spend a day week testing upgrades ubuntu has a large advantage over debian

opera	google-chrome
opera is a proprietary..you can get opera from their website.or you can probably add their repo if you re into binaries.same reason that ubuntu offers chromium but not google-chrome

15922
youtube	vimeo
there are a lot of tools to download videos from youtube dailymotion vimeo etc

15941
filesystems	ntfs
you can look at the filesystems type and your windows is ntfs while the ubuntu partitions are likely ext3 or 4

15951
ubuntu	debian
by doing so you ll save resources on the packaging maintenance since it nearly always will flow into ubuntu automatically through debian

15975
ubuntu	linux
now you have an ext4 partition where ubuntu 10.01 will be installed and a swap area which linux uses as temporary storage space when the operating system is running

15981

despite this ubuntu 10.10 has been a mostly great experience for me and i wholeheartedly recommend it as well as support all gnu linux distros and the open-source and free software movements

16040
mp3	ogg
you can also install tagtool this will allow you to edit the id3 tags of ogg and mp3 files using a nice gui

16051
switching	screens
everytime you switching desktops the number of the desktop will be on the screens

16053
sudoers	passwd
instead of using root as is suggested in the comments put user into the sudoers file as being able to shut down the machine without a passwd

16054
filesystems	ntfs
as other user pointed out ntfs does not support some of the features that applications service may need like unix symbolic links and then there is also the risk of fragmentation which happens much more on ntfs than on ext filesystems

16054
xfs	btrfs
for safety stick with something like xfs ext3 4 or even btrfs

16055
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is not suitable for an home partition there are certain type of filesystems objects character devices named pipes etc which are required for certain services but are not supported on ntfs

16139
ubuntu	debian
you can t compare ubuntu vs debian ram usage

16180
ubuntu	linux
yes there are only few viruses for ubuntu linux but it s also because of good security and default unprivileged user

16185
sudo	passwd
for one thing there is a real difference between gaining access to a user account with sudo rights through a security hole and gaining access to root as in the first case disrupting other users will require running sudo and will still prompt for the account passwd as an additional security step

16201
sudo	passwd
if you try to change the system in anyway that could be harmful you need to do sudo which pretty much guarantees a pause while you are entering the passwd for you to realize that you are about to make a possible big costly change

16201
sudo	passwd
you don t really need it if you need to run several commands as root and you are annoyed by having to enter your passwd several times when sudo has expired all you need to do is sudo -i and you are now root

16201
sudo	passwd
you can always use it in the recovery console the recovery console allows you to try and recover from doing something stupid or fixing a problem caused by an app which you still had to run as sudo ubuntu doesn t have a passwd for the root account in this case but you can search online for changing that this will make it harder for anyone that has physical access to your box to be able to do harm

not sure if there is a specific objective answer to this question but i get the same everything i want to buy a piece of hardware and try to check if it s ubuntu linux compatible

16226
ubuntu	linux
as far as i understand they don t add ubuntu linux to the list mean that they don t officially support it

16226
ubuntu	linux
by officially supporting ubuntu linux mean that they will have to answer every support question

16226
ubuntu	linux
this off course will add cost to their operation given the range of ubuntu linux configurations

16229
sudo	passwd
therefore most professional organizations with multiple systems and multiple administrators that need root privileges require people to login using their own user id and passwd and then use sudo or similar programs to operate with root privileges when necessary

16231
ubuntu	linux
vendors probably feel that they can safely ignore linux ubuntu due to low perceived market share

16237
cpu	processors
you will not necessarily see all processes which are using your cpu in system monitor so the cpu usage might be below 100 for each processors

versioning	upgrade
a non-lts versioning of ubuntu only gets updates for 9 months from its release so to stay up-to-date â which is critically importantâ you need to upgrade twice a year

16369
ubuntu	debian
in terms of the ubuntu development process ubuntu pulls many of its packages from debian

16414
dia	visio
there are admittedly a number of issues with connecting things and other aspects of using dia that are different if you come from a microsoft visio background but to me it still seems to work great

should i target ubuntu directly or should i try to get into debian and then into ubuntu automatically

ubuntu	linux
i do have to agree with pitto why not just get an android tablet they re linux themselves and i think they d integrate with ubuntu better

16532
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu - and linux in general - has the advantage though that you have more ways of influencing the configuration such as using a lighter window manager and disabling desktop effects

16551
sudo	passwd
one such confusion is just remember when sudo asks for a passwd it needs your user passwd and not the root account passwd

16553
sudo	passwd
ubuntu is using sudo -- sudo allows normal users to run commands with superuser privilegies and and to run sudo they are using their own passwd

16558
xfce	gnome
it runs lighter than gnome even xfce

16559
versioning	upgrade
to fix this i removed the versioning of compiz i d upgrade to 0.9.0 and 0.9.2 at different times and rolled back to the 0.8.6 versioning which came at install

16559
ati	nvidia
of course your setup involves and ati card and fglrx driver but it s probably worth giving the above a go substituting nvidia for ati of course

16571

are there any kits designed for ubuntu or at least ones for linux that work well in ubuntu

16631
ubuntu	debian
crunchbang debian ubuntu is also based on debian + openbox is good and it uses 60mb ram

16636
kde	gnome
you will get full compatibility with ubuntu desktop and hence support in ubuntu forums will apply to you but the server cd avoids including desktop packages packages like x gnome or kde by default which it seems you are not interested in

i ve read that the intel pentium iii processors had a clock speed range from 450 mhz to 1.4 ghz so under any condition you have a cpu faster than mine

16693
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu is very closely related with debian ubuntu is a debian based distribution. debian as default has much more less services working as default and in my opinion it is superior to ubuntu for the task to learn gnu linux basics on an old machine

16693
xfce	gnome
so i created a cd from debian-506-i386-xfce+lxde-cd-1.iso this is the first installation cd of debian containing xfce and lxde environments instead of debian s default gnome

16693
xfce	gnome
as a result xfce both xubuntu and debian versions and lxde debian one and even gnome debian works well on the machine

ubuntu	debian
what exactly does ubuntu share with other debian based distributions

16710
debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian
all debian-based distributions share the debian package archive either directly or in the case of ubuntu by making their own rebuilds of it

16710
dpkg	apt
we also all share the dpkg and apt package management tools

16710
uninstall	upgrade
dpkg provides the most reliable package install uninstall upgrade as it is transactional

versioning	upgrade
a distribution upgrade on the other hand does it takes you from one ubuntu stable release to the next thus most packages you have installed will typically be updated to new upstream versioning

16880
versioning	upgrade
distribution upgrade - new features new pieces of software major changes - every part of your ubuntu gets upgrade to new versioning that was developed since last ubuntu release

16896
opera	google-chrome
maybe download google-chrome and opera just to test out

16897

you should not install any proprietary video drivers like the nvidia or ati drivers as they will not be used on the livecd and users will have to reinstall them after installation

16911

root is the owner of the systemd cron job and is configured as the mail destination for non-root daemons cron jobs. most systemd cron jobs are carefully written not to produce output unless something is wrong

16911
ubuntu	debian
in debian some programs will send mail when they are not properly configured but i have not seen this recently in ubuntu

16911

if you re writing your own cron jobs you can set mailto to control where the output is sent

kde	gnome
has anybody tried e17 on ubuntu as an alternative to gnome kde

i haven t tried using e17 on ubuntu 10.10 straight but i know there is an ubuntu based distro called bodhi linux which uses the e17 stack instead of gnome

17055

ubuntu	debian
a bug triager or developer will then determine whether the description should be fixed directly in ubuntu or first in debian

17676
ubuntu	debian
generally if there is no other difference between the ubuntu and debian package we try to get the bug fixed in debian first

17676
ubuntu	debian
fixing small bugs like these is way to get you feet wet in both ubuntu development and how to work with debian packages

17731
ati	nvidia
both nvidia cuda and ati stream opencl implementation support the khronos icd extension so when you call clgetplatformids you ll get two different platforms and therefore you can query for cpu gpu devices on these platforms and of course the ati platform will return the cpu device and nvidia platform will return the gpu device

17741
ubuntu	linux
next thing to do would be too google best must-have anything of this kind ubuntu linux apps and open couple of pages you could also specify some specific app category

with firefox 4.x and starting with google-chrome 9 you have support for webgl apps

17809
google-chrome	firefox
for course for the time being google-chrome renders faster than firefox but firefox is more standard than google-chrome

17815
filesystems	ntfs
however note that ntfs doesn t support all the advanced permissions and journaling that linux filesystems do and that linux requires to work nicely

17815
ubuntu	linux
the ubuntu installer will give you one big partition for all your stuff and this is the way things work most nicely in linux

17854

18045
put	get
just as a test i put the live cd of 10.04 and could not get the problem to duplicate

i am not sure i could build all the packages for mono myself but i d like to try making my own custom versioning of scala package and i want my system to accept it not as a different package but a versioning of the original so that if i put it into a configured repository the system will automatically upgrade to it from currently installed original 2.7

18207
mouse	keyboard
yes there is an open source program to create fake keyboard and mouse inputs for gnu linux

is it possible to move windows from the keyboard itself without touching the mouse

18243
mouse	keyboard	move	drag
i know i can do a alt + left click and drag the window however i am hoping there is something i can use to move it from the keyboard without the mouse

18256
mouse	keyboard
instead of moving windows around by keyboard as if you re moving a mouse you might just as well use a tiling window manager like awesome or xmonad where everything is done by keyboard anyway

18279
uninstall	upgrade
i tried to uninstall evince but got a message that doing so would remove ubuntu-desktop which appears to be needed to update or upgrade the system

move	drag
you can however drag the application by the title bar and move it to the edge of the screen

18626
titlebar	window
ideally the window s titlebar would be behind the panel partially obscured by it

18637
folder	directory
and i should be able to move my documents and other important folder in the home directory to the encrypted drive and symlink them back to the home directory

18637

for a certain duration after that sudo_root doesn t prompt for a passwd for any subsequent sudo foo s in that terminal session

18694
versioning	upgrade
you might get entire application upgrade to versioning you dont want

18704
uninstall	upgrade
i know i can compile it from source and specify prefix option to configure script or make install but it would be better and really easier if i could do it using apt-get as i would be able to use uninstall upgrade and other stuff that apt-get offers

18709
ubuntu	linux
is a commercial solution and you can use it with a lot of linux distributions and of course with ubuntu

18712
dpkg	apt
dpkg and apt offer a way to change the install location as far as i remember it s with dpkg and dir root in the apt config - but check the docs if you really need it

ati	nvidia
and usually better supported than either ati or nvidia

18855
ati	nvidia
ati drivers have come a very long way in so little time and i have a big hunch i hope it does not happen for nvidia lovers sake

18855
ati	nvidia
than next year we will see a very strong ati open sourced driver that can deliver even better than the nvidia closed source

18856
ati	nvidia
these drivers are not so well integrated in a linux environment nvidia drivers have done this better than ati fglrx

18856
ati	nvidia
open source radeon drivers for ati cards also have a quite mature state of development and the nouveau open source nvidia pendant is catching up rapidly

18865
daemons	launchd

is relying on the debian ubuntu built-in init scheme not a good idea

19230
onenote	ms-office
ms-office onenote is a

19234
ubuntu	linux
i m new to ubuntu and linux but i want to give it a go

19239
folder	directory
the only feature it seems to be missing is ubuntu one synchronisation like with tomboy however if you use the default notes directory notes you can synchronise this over ubuntu one as your notes as held in files in this folder

19242
onenote	ms-office
if i remember correctly ms-office 2007 including onenote runs fine with recent versions of wine

19244
folder	directory
another option is to make a script that each time a user login in gnome delete the default folder directory and each user would initiate as a clean config

19245
sudo	passwd
then when i double click the file it would ask me what to do i would click the button run in terminal and then a terminal would pop up and ask me for the sudo passwd

19245
sudo	passwd
the script does execute and i no longer have to put in the sudo passwd

19248
sudo	passwd
sudo remembers your passwd for some time 15 minutes by default

19248
sudo	passwd
you can make sudo to forget the passwd by running sudo -k

19249
sudo	passwd
typically if the sudo passwd has been typed once it s remembered for 15 minutes

19255
ssl	https
always use ssl https always ensure you re using an encrypted wpa2 network not wep and plug in via ethernet if you really want to make sure

19262
onenote	ms-office
onenote - ms-office web apps

19262
onenote	ms-office
but you can use ms-office web apps which is almost as awesome as onenote

19263
filesystems	ntfs
the linux opensource version of this filesystems is only capable of read-only of existing ntfs data

19268
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade it to latest versioning without losing any operating systems in it

19278
ubuntu	linux
although ubuntu is not installing services by default this is something that a local linux guru should check to make sure nothing that you don t know is running

19285
post	get
i have seen post on getting the wireless working with a flash of the bois but i still haven t managed to get this working even with the new bois

19318
chown	sudo
try this sudo chown www-data www-data var www-cake

19324
apache	nginx
if you install apache nginx mysql or others they automatically start upon finishing installation and will start every time the computer boots

19334
pop-up	dialog
in ubuntu firefox when i click on my prpject s submit button for in a practice form a dialog box pop-up asking what firefox should do with the .php file rather than simply displaying it in the browser

19334
google-chrome	firefox
when i do this in windows google-chrome firefox it goes right to the response page

19338
kate	gedit
like for example using gedit kate or bluefish

19374
mouse	keyboard
synergy - you can share clipboard over network including mouse and keyboard

19379
sudo	passwd
if so then you need to set a samba passwd sudo smbpasswd -a username

19393
kde	gnome
by my path i mean that it should be available whenever i login whether it be via the terminal gnome kde or ssh but not for other users

19395
kde	gnome
this way your changes will be available to you only in both gnome kde and also in bash

19408
filesystems	btrfs
you can change some linux filesystems after installation ext3- ext4 ext4- btrfs for example

19408
ubuntu	linux
i will update my answer with relevant links as well as possibly resources for learning ubuntu linux

19411
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
you could also install kubuntu if you want to play with kde instead of gnome for the graphical user interface

19432
nautilus	fstab
on the clients mount the share auto in etc fstab or manual- cli or nautilus

19487
gedit	nano	sudo	passwd
or use sudo nano if gksudo or gedit are not available and enter your passwd

19508
toolbar	tabs
anyway having all those vertically-stacked panels toolbar and tabs isn t the most clever way to fully use our ever-wider screens nope i don t spend all my time watching 16 9 movies

19530
filesystems	fat
partition the drive a partition for your data exfat ntfs3g whatever and a smaller fat 32 which is fairly universal and load it up with drivers executables for reading your filesystems on the main partition on the various paltforms you use

19565
implements	modifiers
note that gnome and x.org implements many modifiers

19565
super	implements	implements	modifiers
however by convention the windows logo key is called super and it is not implements as yet another modifiers by x.org

19601
filesystems	ntfs
ubuntu already comes with ntfs-3g which gives complete read write access to a ntfs filesystems

19606
freebsd	linux
it uses a new object format which allows it to be built in a wider range of os including linux windows osx freebsd etc

19610
ubuntu	linux
its ubuntu 10.04 lts 64-bit and the kernal is linux 2.6.32-27-generic

19612
sudoers	passwd
if you feel that you dont want to enter passwd on mounting and unmounting then one way is to edit sudoers file

19613
truecrypt	umount
at the moment i use a 2mb truecrypt container inside my dropbox which i then have to mount manually access change the files within then umount manually

19613
truecrypt	umount
dropbox sync will only occur when the truecrypt container is umount because dropbox only syncs files that aren t locked and mounting a container locks it

19620
opera	firefox
if i downloaded it with firefox however i didn t need to do that so maybe firefox figured this out somehow in a way that opera does not

19621
ubuntu	linux
i looking for a good editor for developing on php in linux ubuntu

19621
cakephp	yii
framework support cakephp yii zend smarty

19629
ubuntu	linux
i would be grateful if somebody can advise me how to perform the installation of another linux flavour without breakdown of existing ubuntu system

19630
folder	directory
now you ll have a .private_encfs folder in the directory you specified earlier

19665
versioning	upgrade
i don t know if you re talking about a normal upgrade which you do about once a week - perhaps more often or an upgrade from one major versioning to another but the answer is the same for both

19716
apache	lighttpd
i found some tutorials on internet explaining which packages to install with apache but i actually need lighttpd

19722
switching	screens
the -r switching makes less repaint the screens escaping the colours properly

19728
fish	bash
are there any differences between fish and bash in the way to setup an alias to pass commandline arguments that prevent this second alias from working with fish instead of bash

19730
fish	bash
fish defines a completely different programming language to bash though it does support simple aliases in the usual form

19746
google-chrome	firefox
you can also use firefox or google-chrome in the same way

19750
mouse	keyboard
i have a dm3t laptop and when im using the keyboard i frequently accidentally touch it and cause some mouse event

19759
kde	gnome
exaile and amarok both do resume playback on start.exaile for gnome systems amarok for kde systems

19767
sudo	passwd
i can run sudo synaptic and it works fine but how can i get it to just prompt me for my passwd like it used to

19782
bash	zsh
so if you re using bash you can call bash and if you re using something else like zsh you can just enter zsh

19799
ubuntu	linux
assuming you have checked in wikipedia ubuntu forum linux forum linux sites about this very common question i leave you here with a quick breakdown of the common ones

19819
ubuntu	linux
i have never used a linux system in an ad environment before and am trying to join my laptop running ubuntu to join our active directory dc is a windows server 2008 machine using likewise-open

19821
overwrite	preserve
according to the comment this will only preserve home usr local usr src and var local so you will probably have to move var www and anything else you want to preserve into your home directory at least temporarily to prevent it from being overwrite

19828
x86	64bit
i have a x86 64bit dell inspiration pc and it doesn t contain a amd cpu

19834
kde	gnome
unfortunately the gnome file manager does not provide support for nfs at the moment launchpad bug #29263 thanks to joã o pinto for pointing this out and the nfs support in the kde file manager is broken kde bug #184997 now fixed as wellâ

19838
x86	64bit
when cpus became 64bit there was a bit of a fight between the amd64 instruction set which just just an extension of the x86 instruction set developed by intel and first seen in the 386 processor and the ia-64 itanium instruction set which was completely new and incompatible

19842
hide	show
you might also want to consider right-clicking on the panel choosing properties and ticking the show hide buttons

19846
gtk	gdk
i have a small audio recording application programmed with gtk gdk

19855
google-chrome	firefox
if i set firefox as default xdg-mime should not have google-chrome

19869
ubuntu	linux
since i m fairly new with the use of linux i haven t figured out the best practice for solve such a situation in ubuntu

19905
lan	intranet	vpn	lan
for large networks you can set up a vpn which will behave very similarly in essence your computer will seem to be on the remote intranet you can connect to all the computers as though they are on your own lan

19912
fish	bash
since there are differences between those two it would be nice to work with fish and bash at the same time perhaps in different terminal windows

19914
fish	bash
all by default use bash but you can have fish opened along side with them as well

19916
hide	show
i accidentally unchecked view - show menubar which hide the menubar for gnome-terminal and there doesn t appear to be a keyboard shortcut to show the menubar again

19931
fish	ash	fish	bash
this applies to bash ksh ash dash fish csh etc

19936
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu i can go to display preferences and set the external monitor to have a rotated image

19944
switching	screens
at the login screens you can switching from xfce to ubuntu desktop under the session dropdown

19974
xfce	gnome
this file is definitely read by the gnome and xfce environments and should by others as well

20043
versioning	upgrade
however the blueprint says that versioning 3.2 with ratings and reviews support may be officially released as a compulsory upgrade in versioning 10.10

20054
ubuntu	linux
if you installing ubuntu 32bit with 4gb it will detect automatically and installing linux kernal pae

20068
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
when i manually launch the script it asks for sudo passwd so i thought it was because of modprobe and insmod commands and i ve added those commands to sudo visudo

20076
sudoers	passwd
the right etc sudoers configuration to prevent prompting for passwd is

20080
profiling	benchmarking
it will appear in the applications menu under system system profiling and benchmarking

20112
mouse	keyboard
now when i press the disable button in the synaptics touchpad it disables the mouse and the keyboard

20112
mouse	keyboard
after enabled the keyboard keys and mouse clicks do not work

20115
gmail	hotmail
once in awhile i have tried to install different email clients and am always reminded why i have been 100 using webmails gmail yahoo ymail hotmail

20115
gmail	hotmail
consistency i have owned the email accounts gmail yahoo hotmail for almost 10 years

20130
folder	directory
usually the directory name is .appname in your home directory for example mozilla firefox has configuration folder with name .mozilla

20132
firefox	safari
have tried with safari and firefox same result uploading appears but no data transfer

20164
ubuntu	linux
that said your best option is to find 3-5 different models you think are good for your uses and for your children then search for that specific model or just brand with either the word linux or ubuntu at the end

20197
bluetooth	usb
you can buy a tiny usb bluetooth adapter for â 1.26 including delivery and various bluetooth devices i don t know what you want to test from as little as â 4.77 eg a headset

20197
hide	show
emulated testing can often show problems that don t really exist or hide ones that do

20222
mouse	keyboard
i d like to see what s running in the panel and not let go of the mouse to use a keyboard shortcut

20265
bluetooth	usb
i am assuming it s just a case of getting a box and two graphics adaptors as well as a usb mice and keyboard and then another which will be bluetooth for the tv

20279
google-chrome	firefox
the inverse happened to me firefox was downloading the php file and google-chrome was showing the site itself

20334
bonjour	avahi
in mixed network environments you can do this with name resolutions from avahi zeroconfig that would resolve in mac-os as well as in windows when bonjour is running

20345
sudo	passwd
in terminal type sudo passwd root without quotes

20347
sysv	systemd
currently there are actually three different ways for software to be started as a service in ubuntu sysv upstart and systemd

20347
sysv	systemd
one major issue with sysv was that when booting the systemd everything had to be done in serial one thing after another making systemd boot times really slow

20347
put	get
while working on the server team at canonical for the past few months i ve worked on a number of converted job files and the nicest part is that it allows one to get rid of all the script magic and just put in a few commands here and there to define exactly how to start the service and nothing more

20380
ubuntu	linux
i just switched from arch linux to ubuntu 10.10

20388
folder	directory
change some settings in your old account to get some of the new goodies by working through the settings folder of your applications and conf-files in your home directory

20388
folder	directory
or you use the new account and copy the settings folder and conf-files of the few applications you want to keep with their configurations and settings into the new home directory

20390
sudo	passwd
i could use but then i would need to store my sudo passwd in clear which seems much worse than enabling the root account

20394
sudoers	passwd
you can edit etc sudoers to allow whatever user is running the command or all users to run it as root without a passwd perhaps a bit dangerous with rsync

20415
ubuntu	linux
the version of openoffice.org that ubuntu and most other linux distributions were shipping had several patches from novell that sun oracle never accepted but are now included in libreoffice

20423
disk	ram
4gb ram 500gb disk pent d 3.2 ghz

20430
disk	ram
4gb ram 500gb disk pent d 3.2 ghz

20435
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
gnome xfce and kde are the best known at the moment

20447
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
gnome or kde xfce are desktop environments because beside a window manager they package a login screen panels and systrays as well as certain tools to configure and tweak settings

20448
disk	ram
my hardware is a lower spec than your s - i ve got 2gb ram 160gb disk and a pentium m processor

20448
kde	gnome
i m also running xubuntu desktop instead of the default gnome or kde so that probably means i m using fewer resources in the host

20473
folder	dir
i have two identical folder but the are not identical for example java installation dir

20499
ubuntu	debian
php by default reports the current time in utc gmt but in debian ubuntu it should instead be using the system time

20515
folder	dir	folder	directory
that way you always know your going to be using the last complete backup dir and not any other files folder created in that directory or backup folder that failed which would create a mass of duplication

20530
width	height
by location i mean the x y coordinates of the window on the desktop and by size i mean the height and width of the window

20533
mouse	keyboard
with xdotool you can easily interact with windows using keyboard or mouse events

20541
filesystems	ntfs
if wubi cannot access the loop file it may be because there is a filesystems error on the ntfs partition which needs to be addressed first

20549
sudo	passwd
lock the passwd with sudo passwd -l mybackup for these accounts to prevent direct login

20549
sudoers	visudo
allow via sudo those new accounts to run a very specific usr bin rsync --some-long-command from here to there command as root with nopasswd in etc sudoers using sudo visudo

20549
sudo	passwd
this way the only command that can be run as root is the one that you have explicitly allowed and the only remote user that can activate it is the holder of the other half of the installed ssh keypair which because it also has the passwd locked can only be somebody with sudo access themselves or the crontab you set up

20576
ubuntu	linux
not having the original windows disc or product key led me to consider ubuntu linux

20580
inherited	properties
but this one doesn t inherited env properties from the parent shell so you can t use it for example with to get the same result you d have in your parent shell of course only in case you alter your path properties

20620
mouse	keyboard
i recently started using a kvm switch so that i can share my usb mouse and keyboard between my linux and windows notebooks when working at my desk

20620
mouse	keyboard
my windows machine handles the switch seamlessly whereas my ubuntu system takes 5-10 seconds to re-recognize the mouse and keyboard

20668
versioning	upgrade
if upgrade from all previous versioning of ubuntu were supported then this would quickly become a maintenance nightmare as packaging scripts would have to be able to convert from all previously used formats to the current format

20668
versioning	upgrade
upgrading directly from the penultimate or earlier versioning to the current versioning called a skip upgrade is possible but is liable to result in a misconfigured system

20675
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been tried in google-chrome last dev version and in firefox last stable version and i ve been used the both versions of moonlight the lastest stable and the prerelease

20681
folder	directory
mounting dev sdb1 to mnt disk1 places all the files and folder contained within the device standard disk b partition 1 into the directory mnt disk1 where you can access them

20685
kde	kubuntu
or for kde integration for people running kubuntu

20697
filesystems	ntfs
linux recognizes and can mount several type of filesystems including windows ntfs provided you have the right filesystems driver

20703
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	debian
the via vt8500 based ones can run a versioning of debian so you should be able to upgrade them to ubuntu

20713
jobs	cron
without any way to cron the rsnapshot jobs you ll be out of luck

20723
ubuntu	linux
i am a windows user and i m keen to shift to linux so i made live cd of ubuntu 10.10 maverick

20724
versioning	upgrade
i use ubuntu since versioning 6.x and every time i wanted to do an upgrade i experienced problems and issues mostly related to packages and sometime related to hardware

20724
versioning	upgrade
given all possible programs and utilities that are installed and may not be ready for the new versioning of the distro an upgrade to a new versioning is unlikely to upgrade those packages

20730
mouse	keyboard
it s a free open-source cross-platform piece of software that means it can work on both of your machines and more which allows you to switch the keyboard and mouse input from one machine to another just by moving your mouse

20730
mouse	keyboard
it creates a seamless experience you just move the mouse to the screen you want to be on and the keyboard focus changes automatically

20733
gentoo	ubuntu
it works out of the box but i cannot test 2.0 in ubuntu 10.10 and it is working in gentoo arch

20733
solaris	bsd
it is also even possible somehow to get it work with oss4 used in bsd solaris

20812
opensuse	debian	opensuse	centos	rhel	slackware	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	opensuse	debian	centos
listed supported systems debian lenny opensuse rpm-based fedora etc. centos rhel ubuntu lucid lynx ubuntu gutsy gibbon ubuntu karmic koala ubuntu maverick meerkat ubuntu intrepid ibex debian etch ubuntu hardy heron slackware 12.1 ubuntu jaunty jackalope

20816
unix	bsd
seen in system v select is the bsd unix equivalent

20831
post	put
also post comment so i can put link here to current correct answer

20845
versioning	upgrade
updates for final versioning of ubuntu only happen in line with the stable release update policy - that is to say things will only be upgrade if there is an overwhelming benefit from doing so like a security issue

20870
folder	directory
if you want users to be able to access files in a shared folder for example different people log on to the same machine at different times and need access to the same files you can use bindfs to create a shared directory

20870
folder	directory
i use this on my own machine for a number of directory each with different sharing groups one folder is available to all accounts another only to work accounts another only to personal accounts

20873
bash	zsh
if there really is a difference between the behavior on the command line and from a script then most likely the script uses a different interpreter different bash version bash instead of zsh or different shell options try running shopt

20878
ubuntu	debian
disclaimer this is my blog i m a debian developer and ubuntu member and write articles for debian ubuntu users and contributors

20907
kde	gnome
firstly you need to use gtk+ as your style in kde secondly you would need to edit the gtkrc for your gnome theme as opposed to the theme in appearance properties

20907
kde	gnome
this is the only way that kde applications can use your gnome theme when running kde

20919
ubuntu	linux
since i m an ubuntu user first and foremost i m wondering how easy this would be in ubuntu linux

20985
sudo	passwd
this is related to question why is this bypassing the sudo passwd

20985
sudo	passwd
i needed to start the plugin as sudo but i also needed to pass an argument passwd to it that happened to be the same

20985
sudo	passwd
so if my passwd was hello123 the command would be sudo . myscript.sh hi other hello123

20985
sudo	passwd
running from the command line the script would ask for my sudo passwd and then run

20995
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
2 you can configure your sudoers file to allow you to run sudo without having to enter your passwd

21002
opera	firefox
when i open enter root as the user name and my mysql root password and press go then if i use firefox i get offered to download index.php file and if i agree to download the file is empty if i use opera 11 it says connection closed by remote server

21015
ubuntu	debian
however the best route to take is to take your packages to the debian project where they will be submitted for review and if they pass can be uploaded directly into the debian repository and available in the next version of ubuntu

21017
sudo	passwd
i don t see how hard it is to run sudo -i once in a terminal and then just use this one terminal or you could open more than one but then you would have to type your passwd again to do all your sudo stuff

21031
versioning	upgrade
when you dist-upgrade ubuntu to the next versioning it upgrade a lot of packages

21071
ubuntu	linux
linux and windows render fonts differently so you can t expect to have same font in windows and ubuntu rendered the same

21084
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
you can assign certain commands to run without having to provide a passwd with sudo man visudo

21098
mouse	keyboard
after installing a wireless keyboard and mouse i cannot shutdown my pc

21114
virtualbox	parallels
parallels is a nice bit of software but virtualbox works better with linux as far as i know

21120
ubuntu	linux
i am a novice when it comes to linux ubuntu which is why i installed it along side windows

21158
uniq	grep
grep on page 301 uniq on page 323

21186
put	get
by nearly all the commands i put in i get this error command not found

21189
ati	nvidia
indeed one issue would be the graphics card especially if it is either amd ati or nvidia

21221
ubuntu	linux
i would like to know whether there is any standard method how to redistribute binary programs built on a modern ubuntu so that they can be executed on any older linux system

21223
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu with linux 2.6.32-24-generic

21241
ubuntu	linux
ok good news and bad news the good news is in most cases you dont actually need to install drivers for things in ubuntu because the linux kernel has a lot of drivers built in the only cases where you may need to install drivers are for graphics cards and network cards not so much

21252
opera	firefox
here s the current rendering comparison between chromium firefox and opera in that order

21264
ubuntu	linux
wubi has created one big file with whole ubuntu installation root.disk - there are some files i have left on my linux partition that i would like to access from windows partition

21264
ubuntu	linux
i think its ubuntu question because wubi is a windows compatible linux

21287
mouse	keyboard
i can t move mouse pointer nor do anything with keyboard at this point just after userlist shows in gdm

21287
mouse	keyboard
ps both mouse and keyboard work fine because this ubuntu is dual-booting with a windows xp install which loads works fine

21297
mouse	keyboard
and when i start the machine i cannot login the mouse and keyboard cannot be used also

21314
ant	maven
in terms of building the app you should look into using the default build using ant or you could also build it with maven and the maven android plugin

21322
opera	google-chrome
i ve installed google-chrome and opera - and they just fly

21336
bluetooth	usb
there are a few versions of the bluetooth protocol which is all that s needed for your bluetooth device to work so long as it s connected through an open protocol connector such as usb or pci e

21343
sudo	passwd
it would be nice if that does not prompt for passwd but i should still be issuing a sudo to make sure that i know what i am doing

21345
sudoers	visudo
tag the users or groups who you want to have passwordless access to sudo with nopasswd in your sudoers file sudo visudo to edit it

21349
sudoers	passwd
if you dont want to enter passwd everytime then you should edit sudoers file

21349
sudo	passwd
now if you enter sudo followed by the command it wont prompt you to enter passwd

21359
ubuntu	linux
is it possible to do this in linux ubuntu

21403
folder	directory
i am working in a tool called teamcity which uses a folder called .buildserver under home directory of the user

21403
folder	directory
i now want to link this .buildserver inside the home deploy directory to the other folder where i got permission for meaning all the files should be re-routed to that directory

21422
kubuntu	gnome
after installing a ton of gnome apps my kubuntu system wouldn t start the x display any more and locked up on startup

21427
ati	nvidia
does this mean if i have an ati or nvidia card i m forced to install a proprietory driver because the open source drivers for those cards do not support compiz

21430
disk	ram
i m no expert on graphics programming but it seems like it would be pretty trivial to write an opengl program that mis uses pointers to get a bunch of junk from video ram and then render it out to screen or an image on disk

21536
installation	upgrade
you can upgrade your installation even without the repositories and it s easy

21536
versioning	upgrade
just put in a cd of the next versioning 8.04 and the update-manager will ask if you want to upgrade

21568
filesystems	hfs+
how well is the hfs+ filesystems supported

21572
put	get
ftp performance are the numbers from the ftp client for get put of the same file

21578
google-chrome	firefox
i have google-chrome 8.0.552.237 on ubuntu 10.10 64-bit and flash is not working i have tried a variety of methods to install flash including firefox flash-aid and the flash-installer package and nothing is working for me

21578
google-chrome	firefox
just not google-chrome or firefox

21623
folder	directory
if you try to create a synchronized folder from something that is not an actual directory inside your home if it is for example a symlink to somewhere else or if it is a subdirectory of a synchronized folder then the creation will fail

gentoo	ubuntu
even though i found this solution in gentoo it would almost certainly work in ubuntu too

21641
versioning	upgrade
how do i upgrade ubuntu 10.10 to the latest development versioning of ubuntu 11.04

21652
vmware	virtualbox
since i already use vmware for other purposes i don t want to use virtualbox

21713
restrict	shared
similar rules apply if you stick restrict character eg a question mark in the shared name

21736
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
the problem is that your usb stick is probably using fat 16 32 or ntfs as filesystems which doesn t support permissions

21741
ubuntu	linux
although i ve noticed a certain lack of snappiness with linux vs windows in the past i really can t say i ve had much to grumble about with the recent distributions of ubuntu

21777
cvs	svn
centralised repositories - cvs svn simple file server etc

21777
bazaar	git
decentralised repositories - git mercurial bazaar

21777
bazaar	git
developed by torvalds himself after his disastrous time with a proprietary system git is lightning fast and only slightly harder to use than bazaar

21786
uninstall	upgrade
i have had to uninstall programs before the upgrade

21786
installation	upgrade
the installation process is very good at not killing existing session when running the upgrade

21813
mp3	ogg
you can then play around with ffmeg et al to compress this down from pcm to something more manageable like mp3 or ogg

21855
proftpd	pureftpd
i thought that i could give each user a home folder and put symlinks for the folders he has read access to and make the user part of the folder s group when he has write access too but now i think that this wouldn t work because with pureftpd or proftpd i can only specify the virtual user s mapping to a system user and only one guid for each virtual user

21860
mouse	keyboard
i still have the monitor keyboard and mouse all sitting waiting to jump into action

21900
virtualbox	parallels
if you are not familiar with the install process i strongly advise to try the whole procedure of the parallels installation on your virtualbox disk the one you already have a natty system running on before running on your productive system

21906
cpu	processors
just having a 64-bit processors isn t sufficient the cpu also needs hardware virtualization support

21933
chown	sudo
chown root root usr bin sudo

21946
installation	upgrade
most experienced users prefer a fresh installation to an upgrade and indeed there always are some proplems from incomplete updates or from regressions that may not have come up when you had done a new installation

21946
post	get
we can only have a look at what people post in the support forums to get a vague idea what problems may arise

21946
range	min
also the time needed for a fresh install is in the range of 20 min

21947
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and linux in general faces the same problems as microsoft by targeting close to every hardware combination under the sun

21947
ubuntu	linux
i have no idea what ubuntu s market share is of the linux total but it s almost certainly less than 100

21961
vmware	virtualbox
would it be possible to install ubuntu preferably 64-bit dual-boot on such a machine and then using virtualbox vmware etc

21975
ubuntu	linux
please take a look at pac manager a perl gtk app that pretends to be ubuntu general linux securecrt equivalent but with much more options

21985
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r ftpuser www-data var www

22002
folder	directory
just to illustrate on a directory home ftp pictures to accomplish the folder pictures should be read only for journalists writable for associates and invisible for the rest.

22019
vim	gedit
how do i get quickly to use gvim or just vim in a terminal as its default text editor instead of gedit

22026
gedit	nano
i opened up usr share quickly templates ubuntu-application internal quicklyutils.py not the compiled version in nano searched for gedit and saw

22058
ubuntu	linux
you could also check out the stackexchange gis beta site to see if there are ubuntu or linux users there with tips

22065
google-chrome	firefox
as it turns out firefox and even the latest google-chrome on ubuntu 10.04 lts do not embed hyperlinks in pdf web page exports

22065
google-chrome	firefox
sure there are several google-chrome and firefox plugins that let you export as pdf but what these do is connect to the url remotely generate the pdf remotely and then force a download in your browser to download it from a remote location

22065
google-chrome	firefox
that means that all i get back on the pdf printing from these firefox or google-chrome plugins is a login page

22078
bazaar	git
there is news it will support git in the future although no news on bazaar support which is what ubuntu developers like to use

22112
put	get
some have even mixed those two systems to get nice numbers to put on their packaging

22132
disk	ram
if you have a very intensive process that uses all of your ram then you will find the entire of gnome and the ubuntu desktop will be saved to disk in the swap while the process completes

22165
bazaar	git
however you should be able to do your own version control through bazaar git and sync over the version control folders alongside the other synced files

22173
folder	directory
then the client will be installed in your home directory in a folder called .secondlife-install

22173
folder	directory
if you ran the script as sudo and accepted all defaults then the application will be installed in a folder called secondlife-install under the opt directory just remove this directory with the following command

22173
folder	directory
you can remove the .secondlife folder in your home directory if you do not need it for another client or for retaining secondlife settings if you intend to try the same or another viewer

22173
folder	directory
just remember that a .secondlife config and cache directory is created in your home folder this can be deleted safely if you do not have another client that uses that same config and cache directory

22233
sudo	passwd
is there a utility that always prompts the user for confirmation before executing a command similar to the way sudo asks for passwd

22245
versioning	upgrade
upgrade the kernel this is somewhat more risky as you will be running an unsupported and untested combination of ubuntu versioning and kernel versioning - upgrading the kernel may fix the sensor support while breaking something else

22247
ethernet	wireless
capabilities ethernet physical wireless

22252
filesystems	ntfs
if you want access a partition from both ubuntu and windows best solution probably is ntfs or fat32 native windows filesystems with r w support in ubuntu

22257
bash	zsh
if option 1 that can be done using the preexec hook in zsh or the debug trap in bash

22275
pulseaudio	mixer
it s a lot more than just a mixer - it s a whole suite of tools for managing pulseaudio

22293
filesystems	ntfs
the primary reason for that is each filesystems was built with a specific platform in mind ntfs fat32 for windows ext3 4 for linux

22293
ubuntu	linux
in general your best options are probably fat32 or maybe ntfs linux support for these are more mature and in ubuntu by default unlike windows support for ext3 4

22310
mouse	keyboard
unfortunately lot of games seem to not behave in a desktop-friendly fashion exclusively grabbing keyboard and mouse during the action

22317
daemon	cron
then save your file and exit the text editor the new crontab will automatically be installed and loaded into the cron daemon

22341
ubuntu	debian
another point worth noting is that ubuntu is siding with debian on this one and trying to prebuild packages titled ruby-gemname or similar into aptitude to simplify package management and track gem changes

22360
switching	screens
1024x768 works fine but for some reason when i put 1440x900 when i switching to ttyx the command prompt is almost right off the bottom of the screens

22390
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r username var www

22426
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
its ubuntu with different desktop environment i.e xfce which is a lot lightweight than gnome or kde

22437
mouse	keyboard
hovering over the open parent menu option with the mouse pointer and pressing the keyboard shortcut after enabling the editable menu accelerators option in settings

22456
filesystems	ntfs
so far i m using ntfs as my filesystems but i find it quite slow because i ve got lots of files there

22490
ubuntu	mint
i have live ubuntu tried also mint and kubuntu same effect on a usb stick with persistence enabled

22490
ubuntu	mint
i can not reproduce these steps anymore with latest ubuntu kubuntu mint

22494
switching	screens
as soon as i switching to this resolution when i go to change a wallpaper the screens turns to colored lines or freezes

22506
ubuntu	linux
by installing easybcd on windows which allows to boot into multiple operating systems including ubuntu linux

22507
ubuntu	linux
this worked exactly as expected under arch linux before i switched to ubuntu

22510
ubuntu	linux
i know that ubuntu has come a long way in helping new users to get used to their linux system..and making things as easy as possible

22511
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade to a supported versioning

22552
folder	directory
we will expand this functionality in the future to match the ubuntu desktop where you can enable any folder in your home directory for sync

22555
pop-up	dialog
the standard ubuntu tool pop-up a dialog to ask where i want to save the file i would like a tool that doesn t ask and just saves on the desktop or wherever as 00001.png 00002.png etc

22573
ubuntu	debian
perhaps when you have accomplished what you need to you can distribute this as a ruby library and package it for debian ubuntu

22643
switching	screens
for fast switching when your mouse is at your screens edge you can also give brightside a try

22649
sudo	passwd
however synaptic and sudo apt-get ask for passwd

22697
versioning	upgrade
i seem to recall something about ubuntu making a permanent exception to allow new firefox versioning in the middle of upgrade cycles

22700
ubuntu	linux
i don t know of any with the ubuntu logo but i do know that das keyboards sell linux keycaps for their super keys with tux on it on their keyboards

22730
nautilus	fstab
boot live cd find what drive is current home and your old home you can use nautilus then open fstab on disk not live cd that is on you can find uuids with df -h and switch the mount points

22734
kde	kubuntu
not only in the kubuntu but in fedora kde it seems that the same bug is present also

22736
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu or any other linux the firewall is a part of the base system and is called iptables netfilter

22738
versioning	upgrade
when firefox 3.6 approaches end-of-life the other supported ubuntu releases will be upgrade to the latest versioning of firefox although this may not be 4.0

22739
udp	tcp
out of the box ubuntu ships with no tcp or udp ports open hence the belief that there s no reason to run uncomplicated firewall ufw by default

22752
cifs	smb
mounting windows smb file shares using cifs

22783
umask	mount
mount cdrom manually with umask 000

22817
ati	nvidia
it may still be a driver issue as i said at the start via isn t well supported so you may want to upgrade to an nvidia intel or ati graphics card

22819
rsa	dsa
this assumes that you have a dsa key -- if you have an rsa key use id_rsa.pub in all cases

22831
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade to the final versioning of course i had the font but it was not set up as it should have been with the correct font sizes

22846
titlebar	window
i ve found the indicator applet appmenu and window controls for the panel but i m looking for one that works similar to the titlebar global menu indicator

22848
ubuntu	mint
i have installed mint lxde 10.04 on my netbook but would prefer the standard ubuntu

22868
ubuntu	linux
it s not uncommon for this to happen on a dual-boot system with windows wiping out linux ubuntu or vice versa but recovery can still be a bit touchy

22870
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint and ubuntu use the apt .deb package manager and share repositories

22870
ubuntu	mint
theoretically it should be possible to move from mint lxde to vanilla gnome ubuntu

22889
ubuntu	linux
select ubuntu with linux 2.6.xx-xx-generic recovery mode

22929
post	get
the response of psusi really helped however it was really too rough for me and i spent something like three hours to get it all and to extract what would be interesting for me from his post

22943
mouse	keyboard
it has no keyboard or mouse attached so i connect over vnc for administration and manual tasks

23029
mouse	keyboard
for the window manager click on the xfce icon on your panel has the x with the mouse then go to settings keyboard and click on the application shortcuts

23039
hex	binary
i often use gcalctool to quickly convert a number between binary hex decimal

23041
pop-up	dialog
the key ring dialog pop-up whenever ubuntu finds a wireless network.it is utility to save your secret network credentials like password etc.you can change the settings from system administration keyring manager. i think you can find the manager here i don t remember the exact location sorry

23051
ubuntu	linux
apparently ubuntu s version of nautilus is intended to sort case-insensitive contrary to most linux application defaults

23099
lvm	mdadm
lvm and mdadm can expand the block device then you can run resize2fs to expand the fs assuming it is ext 234

23107
ubuntu	linux
i am relatively new at using linux and have just installed a fresh ish copy of ubuntu 10.04.1 lts minimal install running on a hypervm vps

23133
slackware	archlinux
more frequently i m tempted back to slackware or right now tempted to try archlinux

23133
ubuntu	linux
but ubuntu as a whole isn t perfect and the package system might not be enough to keep me in the ubuntu flavour of linux

23134
ubuntu	linux
i want to use turbotax online to do my income tax but apparently ubuntu or any other flavor of linux is not supported

23134
google-chrome	firefox
i have google-chrome and firefox but both get the not supported page at turbotax website

23155
ati	nvidia
i suspect that you may be using an nvidia card if this is the case then you are using twinview which distorts the dimensions of the desktop because it s fake it s one desktop over two displays instead of two desktops like ati and intel to set this up just use xsetwacom

23175
mouse	keyboard
i have a logitech mouse keyboard wireless set that works perfectly

23180
mouse	keyboard
vim starts up quickly in the console while gvim does not respond to any keyboard or mouse action for about 3 or 4 seconds after the window appears

23242
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
windows filesystems like fat and ntfs never had these features and so it s not possible to install ubuntu on them

23242
filesystems	xfs
other filesystems like btfs ext2 xfs etc however are possible to use

23292
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
i ve gone through kde 4 netbook edition all kinds of gnome 2 adjustments docky cairo-dock unr 10.04 unity and even tried xfce for extra speed

23311
google-chrome	firefox
so i am wondering if it is possible to use a browser on my desktop to connect to the server via ssh with a real browser firefox or google-chrome

23311
google-chrome	firefox
is this possible by default or are there any add-ons for firefox google-chrome

23329
ubuntu	linux
in turn you ll have to figure out how to fix it and you ll have an even better understanding of how ubuntu and linux work

23336
ubuntu	linux

bluetooth	usb
many mobile phones are equipped with software to provide tethered internet access via bluetooth or a usb cable

versioning	upgrade
i have ubuntu server 10.04 and it comes with its own couchdb versioning 0.10 i am trying to upgrade this to 1.0.1 or at least install 1.0.1 on the side

23408
put	get
i have a netbook a flash drive 512mb and an sd card 512mb and the ubuntu netbook edition is 696mb is there any way i can put half of the installation on the flash drive and the other half on the sd card and get it installed

23414
ubuntu	debian
it is a is a wrapper that makes it easy to use pbuilder with many different versions of ubuntu and or debian

23419
bonjour	avahi
bonjour which is apple s version of avahi is from memory reasonably compatible

23438
jobs	cron
cron passes a minimal set of environment variables to your jobs

23438
jobs	cron
it s worth noting that variables from etc environment will be passed on to cron jobs just not the variables cron specifically sets itself such as path

23438
jobs	cron
you can also set the path variable in the crontab file which will apply to all cron jobs

23446
ssd	sata
leaving the data cable but still with plugged in sata power cable let the system boot up completely from my ssd without spinning up the hdd

23465
ubuntu	linux
hi have tried installing ubuntu and a few other linux distro s without luck on one usb stick

23469
daemon	cron
cron daemon is not running

23474
ubuntu	linux
when i originally installed ubuntu first time using linux i chose to not participate in sending info about package usage ti was an install-time option .

23483
ubuntu	linux
now you will have to use ubuntu live cd or some other live linux cd to boot into linux and restore grub

23522
lvm	mdadm
so i have looked into mdadm for raid 5 + lvm

23535
ubuntu	linux
you can easily limit the amount of processes that can be spawned in ubuntu and most other linux distributions by modifying etc security limits.conf

23537
move	drag
if you middle-click drag and drop or press alt after you ve started moving the icon so that it doesn t trigger the window move and then let go of the file a context menu shows up giving you the choice of copy move link etc

23565
put	get
to get a little more vertical space you can also try to put any menus indicators selectors etc

23574
g++	gcc
i understand that ubuntu uses hardening wrappers around gcc but i don t know how to actually compile something using g++ in this state

23597
kde	gnome
note that xdg-open is supposed to supercede gnome-open as it s a freedesktop.org solution that is cross-desktop and agreed upon instead of gnome kde specific

23670
hide	show
this is kinda okay but if you click the show hide all windows button conky gets hidden as well which ideally should not happen

23677
ubuntu	debian
pushing in debian ubuntu

23677
ubuntu	debian
the pushing of your package in ubuntu debian repositories includes a review from the maintainer and the ftp masters at debian

23683
sudo	passwd
sudo does not need passwd

23690
bash	zsh
the notation requires bash or zsh it will not work in dash or sh on ubuntu

23710
ssd	sata
swap on a sata ssd

23733
folder	directory
no client-side software is needed - just export via nfs backup directory on the clients for example home or home username desktop etc. or share folder on windows stations

23734
ssd	sata
so i swapped my shiny sata ssd for an even shinier pci-e ssd

23755
daemons	systemd
or daemons to describe a systemd service

23759
nautilus	fstab
editing fstab i m able to share downloads partition with guest on limited privileges but vm can be only set to limited and have disabled automounting - so guest can t mount it but it still can be seen in nautilus plus i must always mount it manually when i login to allday account

23764
mouse	keyboard
vmware fusion for mac has an option in preferences keyboard and mouse to choose which key combination to map the command key to it s mapped to the windows key by default

23790
ubuntu	debian
will not work on the first but it will on the second and this is the recommended way of building packages from source on ubuntu and i think debian as well see this question

23790
pull	push
how am i supposed to pull source code down test a patch then push it back out

23820
ubuntu	debian
i don t need to make ubuntu one run on debian i just need to make tomboy download and also sync with my ubuntu one account

23832
ubuntu	debian
see also mark shuttleworth the guy that is the reason we have an ubuntu in the first place on binary compatibility between ubuntu and debian - debian is the closest distribution relative of ubuntu

there s the linux action show which isn t an ubuntu specific video podcast exactly but they do cover everything that s new in the linux unix community in general and there s something happening to ubuntu quite often these days

in mac os x the apple logo is in the left the min max close buttons are on the left but still you can resize and position your dock wherever you want

23944
hide	show
ubuntu by default hide the grub menu when ubuntu is the only os installed and show it when additional oss like windows are detected so that you can choose between oss at the grub boot menu

23954
switching	screens
if screens is blank but has a backlight try hitting enter or switching between virtual terminals

23963
versioning	upgrade
on the kernel i know there are some software packages that are slow to upgrade and aren t getting along with the latest versioning

23974
ubuntu	debian
the collective group of software that makes up the ubuntu distribution including debian

24050
ubuntu	linux
for the record the bluetooth documentation and support for the new bluetooth kernel in 10.10 is junk and the linux bluetooth and ubuntu team needs to do a far better job of providing documentation and support if they want people to take their operating system seriously as a consumer product

24050
chown	chmod
chown and chmod the script from step 1a then copy it to etc init.d

24050
chown	sudo
sudo chown root bluetooth

24087
afp	smb
when i am logged in to the server via ssh on the terminal to change the smb afp configuration i can only test the configuration from the server over terminal

24087

is there a way to tunnel the connection over ssh no vpn only one ssh port is open on the firewall so that i also could test the connection from my ubuntu or os x desktop host

so i am a supernoob to linux and consiquently ubuntu version 10.10

24229
rss	feed
a lot of torrent search engines have the ability to provide an rss feed of matches allowing you to set up torrent programs to download items which are published on the feed

24229
rss	feed
so i was wondering if there was an rss feed somewhere that only loads up the official torrent files for releases

24229
rss	feed
so from the responses there doesn t appear to be an existing rss feed that does what i am after

24236
post	get
through several post around the web i was able to get snx installed on the laptop plug in my server connection information and be asked for a password only to have the connection fail

24254

you will be able to select the normal gnome desktop at login much like you now can select different installed desktop environments like kde xfce ...

24304
ubuntu	linux
i couldn t find any linux or ubuntu documentation about cms files specifically i couldn t even find any microsoft documentation about what the format should contain

24320
sudo	passwd
in this instance the correct command would be cp etc passwd path to file you want to save to - for other files you can drop the sudo

24324
post	get
i did some reading and saw post claiming that the crystal hd card is finally supported by the newer flash 10.2 rc in ubuntu but i can t get it to work

24336
ubuntu	linux
i was hoping that linux especially ubuntu had gotten over the driver-hell as it had for the rest of my system -- is there a working open-source ati driver being developed

24369
dpkg	aptitude
holding does appear to be the way to go though i m not quite sure on the difference between dpkg and aptitude holds

24369
dpkg	aptitude
without doing the aptitude hold line aptitude would still try to update packages marked with the dpkg --set-selections command and i think the opposite also applies

24401
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu use a standard directory hierarchy

24411
vim	emacs
if you have interest in linux beyond basic desktop usage it s worth investing time learning a decent command line text editor like vim or emacs

24472
ftp	smb
as you said smb userid 192.168.0.2 sandbox workspace is a uri much like ftp somesite.com

24472
ftp	smb
uris need programs which understand the protocol mentioned in the uri i.e smb in case of samba share and ftp in case of ftp

24472
ftp	smb
we do not expect eclipse to use an ftp location as a workspace and in the same manner it may not be able to use an smb location as workspace

24476
folder	directory
if you have your whole old home directory backed up all you need to do is copy the old .gnupg folder to your new home

24507
acpi	vga
cat proc acpi video vga lcd brightness.

24509
ubuntu	linux
the menuentry name can be ubuntu with linux 2.6.35-25-generic or whatever you choose to be

for some odd reason it outputs some of the progress to stdout and some to stderr which makes it extra hard to parse

24582
gmail	hotmail
including all the major ones gmail yahoo hotmail mines

24611
ubuntu	opensuse
it would be nice if there was an ldap client such as the one available in opensuse so that ubuntu can be easily configured to authenticate against the ldap database

24626
put	get
i ve put the code into that script but i m not sure how to get that to run on startup

24644
min	max
i had a similar issue and found my limiting the java amount of memory to the java process process it was much faster min 512mb max 1gb

24688
ubuntu	linux
in fact you don t really even need to do that because ubuntu linux can read write ntfs

24688
ubuntu	linux
but if you want windows to be able to read a linux filesystem right now you need to make sure that you use ext3 filesystem on ubuntu because the tools available don t work with ext4 right this minute.

24780
kde	gnome
is there a way to make kde applications like digikam look native in gnome

24802
sudo	passwd
although sudo isn t needed for the first command you ll want to enter the passwd before the screen locks because you ll have to unlock it to gain sudo ability to suspend if you don t

24829
ssl	https
i would like to enable ssl for all pages so i can view any of these pages using either http or https

24860
google-chrome	firefox
what i would like to do is merge all bookmarks and passwords into some solution that actually works either with tools available under ubuntu or with a browser-based tool addon plugin extension which works between between google-chrome chromium and firefox

24865
google-chrome	firefox
lastpass works great for passwords i use it with google-chrome and firefox also on my android device

24874
apache	nginx
you can add it within apache or add it with a proxy like nginx

24891
ubuntu	linux
if you used the whole hard disk for ubuntu ntfs partition you had for windows got reformatted as a linux partition

24902
chmod	mkdir
if that is the case you can do sudo mkdir tmp and sudo chmod 1777 tmp assuming tmp is not a separate filesystem to recreate tmp directory and to set correct permissions

24955
stdout	stderr
in your example in order for your grep -v to properly operate on it you combine stdout standard output and stderr with the arcane syntax you see

24956
stdout	stderr
error messages are written to stderr not stdout but | pipes only stdout

24956
stdout	stderr
you probably want which pipes stderr as well as stdout

24984
ubuntu	linux
my linux kernel running on this computer is 2.6.35-25-generic and my ubuntu version is 10.10

24992
ssd	sata

24994
postgresql	mysql
postgresql 9.0 is already available via ppa what about mysql

25038
chown	sudo
sudo chown otb -r

25038
sudo	chgrp
sudo chgrp otb -r

25043
umask	mount
second of all since you don t care about security on this drive you should mount the drive specifying a umask which makes all files 777 as they are written

25043
umask	sudo
additionally since it seems that a umask option may not be available for all filesystem types there s another way to set the default file permissions of files created when in sudo

25043
umask	sudo	sudoers	umask
umask_override if set sudo will set the umask as specified by sudoers without modification

25043
sudoers	umask
this makes it possible to specify a more permissive umask in sudoers than the userâ s own umask and matches historical behavior

25043
umask	sudo	sudoers	umask
if umask_override is not set sudo will set the umask to be the union of the userâ s umask and what is specified in sudoers

25067
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
on the ubuntu debian based linux client machines use sudo apt-get install iptux

25086
mouse	keyboard
move the mouse pointer into the small white window that opens up then hit the key on the keyboard that you want to use as replacement

25088
ubuntu	linux
after upgrading my linux system from ubuntu 9.04 to ubuntu 10.10 i suceeded correcting most problems all related to intel 82865g integrated graphics adapter support and compiz is still not working but that s another matter but for one i only have a partial solution

25123
ubuntu	linux
anecdotally i ve never had a serious issue running ubuntu or linux generally on dell hardware

25135
ubuntu	linux
updating a bios from ubuntu is only possible if the hardware manufacturer provides a custom tool that runs with ubuntu or linux

25168
folder	directory
the following directory are currently in my dev folder

25173
google-chrome	firefox
it happens with google-chrome and firefox

25209
post	get
as soon as i get back home i ll post back results

25211
ubuntu	linux
i read that using a linux kernel ubuntu rt kernel was able to increase the response time of a java application by 4x

25225
google-chrome	firefox
i run firefox if i plan on using flash-heavy stuff like youtube or homestar runner or if flash crashes while i m using google-chrome

25230
folder	directory
for any scripts or programs i write or install that are not provided by the ubuntu repositories i keep them in a bin directory in my home folder

25246
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
a desktop such as gnome kde xfce

25247
ubuntu	linux
in short support for your controller isn t around till linux kernel 2.6.37-rc4 aka ubuntu kernel 2.6.37-8.x

25251
ubuntu	debian
this setup was trivial in debian and older versions of ubuntu

25260
gmail	hotmail
i am using several e-mail addresses hotmail gmail yahoo and sky

25260
gmail	hotmail
gmail and sky now work e-mail can be received and sent but hotmail my primary e-mail address and yahoo will only receive

25302
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my ubuntu versioning from 10.10 to 11.04 alpha and on reboot got an error the disk drive for is not ready yet or not present continue to wait

25304
ethernet	wireless
currently i have ethernet and wireless networks configured through a network manager further nm but it seems to be a bit buggy i need a different mac for ether which is never applied if using nm so i would like to move all the network configs to interfaces file

25328
versioning	upgrade
10.04.2 and i m unable to upgrade it to 10.10 versioning

25354
ubuntu	debian
now that debian squeeze has released this will likely work itself out at some point in the future and we ll end up with just unison in ubuntu

25396
jobs	cron
i do not want to be running cron jobs to set permissions regularly

25400
ubuntu	debian
i ve used this on debian boxes and it works on ubuntu as well

25400
ubuntu	linux
the descriptions work here because turnkley linux is based on ubuntu

25412
pop-up	dialog
insert a blank cd in the drive and select do nothing or cancel if an autorun dialog box pop-up

25430
versioning	upgrade
it works well on upgrade versioning 9.10 10.04 but not on jaunty

25440
vmware	virtualbox
vmware supports 3d acceleration as does virtualbox

25443
put	get
remember that some processes are started by the superuser root you may need to put sudo in front of your command to get more information about such processes open files

25458
folder	directory
you can reset any settings by removing the corresponding folder in your home directory

25469
vim	gedit
use a different text editor than vim maybe gedit if you like.

25469
vim	gedit
use a different text editor than vim maybe gedit if you like.

25476
filesystems	fat
filesystems fat 32

25479
versioning	upgrade
try adding the wine ppa ppa ubuntu-wine ppa to your software sources and upgrade wine to the latest versioning

25482
folder	directory
i have built and installed an application under a directory of my choosing let s say under home jim usr so files have been put in three-four folder all under this folder bin include lib share etc.

25501
titlebar	window
nevertheless the close icon for the tabs in gedit seems not to be affected directly by the changes made by the window titlebar buttons layout

25510
kde	kubuntu
are ubuntuone services coming to kubuntu kde desktop in 11.04

25524
google-chrome	firefox
some programs like the browsers google-chrome and firefox have an option to synchronise configurations

25533
ati	nvidia
i suspect the inverse uninstalling nvidia and installing ati s is more complicated since installing ati s drivers from the command line is always problematic for me

25534
versioning	upgrade
note that if you download the driver from the nvidia website that is not the versioning of the driver supported in ubuntu and could lead to other issues such as upgrade problems so you re on your own if you do that

25555
folder	directory
the thing is that i d like only my user to have access to it so putting it in another directory than my home folder is not an option

25568
ubuntu	debian
this was removed from debian and subsequently ubuntu for the following reasons

25582
versioning	upgrade
it s fixed now and as far as i can tell there s only one issue during upgrade between specific versioning in a narrow window

25591
sudo	gnome-terminal	sudo	passwd
if i am using the command line in xterm gnome-terminal etc. i can keep sudo from re-prompting for a passwd within some limits or i can disable it

25591
sudo	passwd
by default there is only a 15 minute grace-period after entering a sudo passwd before it prompts for it again

25591
sudo	passwd
but if i go to another window to access the command line there it will immediately ask for my passwd if i try to sudo

25591
sudo	passwd
is there a way to tell sudo that it should regard all the windows i open as coming from the same user and to not ask again for my passwd if the last sudo timer hasn t expired

25596
mouse	keyboard
the problem is that it doesn t detect usb drives in windows 7 but usb peripherals mouse + keyboard are working

25596
versioning	upgrade
i would also like to upgrade to the latest versioning without any risk without losing my virtual hard disk drive

25602
ubuntu	linux
i d like to do the same with a linux ubuntu program.

25645
folder	directory
changes the working directory to home and puts your username folder

25648
ubuntu	debian
i am interested in knowing which options are used to compile vim in the package vim as i am trying to compile vim from source on another system not running debian ubuntu and would like it to work in a similar way

25650
daemons	systemd
systemd wide programs usually daemons data like mysql databases

25652
ubuntu	debian
you can also download the source package from scroll down if you can t log into a debian ubuntu box to run apt-get

25661
ubuntu	debian
remote server is running debian i am on ubuntu lucid -- and a noob in ssh

25684
ati	nvidia
most people will be concerned with the proprietary drivers for nvidia and ati the two leading video card manufacturers

25686
chown	chmod
you might want to look further into commands like chmod and chown and file permissions

25687
ubuntu	linux
i m using teamviewer right now from my ubuntu system to provide remote support for other linux and windows systems

25688
filesystems	fat
note that file permissions are not supported by non-linux filesystems like fat

25693
dpkg	apt
i m not sure if this is a problem with apt or with dpkg but it certainly doesn t look good

25707
gentoo	ubuntu
i reinstalled my desktop machine with ubuntu 10.10. coming from gentoo where i used xfce

25709
wan	lan
technology is built-in to use your lan as well so you re not constantly uploading downloading over the wan

25716
folder	directory
when the files are built it will look like a local directory to the build program whatever that might be but that folder will really be a folder on your nfs drive

25718
xfce	gnome
by the way it s a bit odd situation you told that you used xfce on that nfs mounted share and no gnome

25738
ubuntu	linux
trim support was introduced in linux 2.6.33 ubuntu 10.10 however it is unlikely that ubuntu 10.04 will ever receive trim support

25744
sudoers	passwd
the most simple way to allow a user access to it without having to type their passwd is by editing etc sudoers

25744
sudo	passwd
this would allow you to set certain sudo commands to not require a passwd

25745
min	max
i don t know if this is pertinent but sometimes changing the min max state of a firefox window minefield specifically seemed to allow the troublesome instance to display the video in fullscreen mode

25747
kde	gnome
i have both kde and gnome desktop environments installed on ubuntu 10.10

25749
ati	nvidia
also the file does not exist since x.org does not needed anymore for some video cards as i understand only some video cards have xorg.conf because of specific configurations like nvidia and ati

25755
ati	nvidia
the proprietary drivers for nvidia and ati sometimes do not play well with acpi suspend mode

25762
gedit	nano
ie gksudo gedit etc fstab or sudo nano etc fstab

25767
folder	directory
disk usage analyzer tool shows that .ecryptfs folder occupies the same amount of disk space as my home directory

25773
ubuntu	debian
note also much of the software in ubuntu enters the repositories through being in debian first so the debian social contract the debian free software guidelines are of some relevance

25775
ethernet	wireless
i can connect to ethernet but i m not able to connect to my wireless network

25799
folder	directory
it searches the home directory for a folder matching the name and jumps to it

25807
vmware	virtualbox
i guess some desktop virtualization software like virtualbox or vmware etc can be used

25828
ubuntu	linux
i am still fairly new to linux hosting and am currently working on some policies for our production ubuntu servers

25836
ubuntu	linux
that s also a reason that ubuntu - unlike many other linux and or unix distributions - don t have root user by default cannot be logged in since no valid password it s quite dangerous to log in as root since you or anybody who managed to log in ... have unlimited access

25840
kde	gnome
you can use the fish handler to achieve file management and sharing through via ssh both in dolphin in kde or nautilus in gnome

25846
postfix	dovecot
the easiest one i ve ever installed is postfix with dovecot

25848
kde	gnome
there s a kde version too k menu gnome debian package

25864
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is working fine but i prefer google-chrome

25905
hide	show
i want to emulate the function that fences does in windows systems by double clicking the desktop you show hide the icons folders you have in the desktop

25917
mouse	keyboard
also is there a way to emulate the left mouse click on the keyboard

25929
ati	nvidia
like nvidia s or ati s

25930
vim	emacs
the three applications i tried are vim emacs and gnome-do

25934
versioning	upgrade
i have one partition with the newest versioning installed a second partition with an older versioning installed as a backup just in case a swap partition that both share and a boot partition so the bootloader doesn t need to be setup after each upgrade

25935
ubuntu	debian
for all debian based distribution like is ubuntu see you should really look at the debootstrap tool which is the correct solution to this problem

25935
ubuntu	debian
anyway this installation method is totally supported and one of the best ways to do it so there should be no problem i think the debian and ubuntu installer cd are using it

25936
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu has an article on installing ubuntu from a unix linux system using debootstrap to do a cross-install. it won t be a perfect fit to what you re doing but it should get you on your way

25977
ati	nvidia
i don t have a setup for ati card in this way but i have similar for nvidia to switch between nvidia s binary driver and nouveau open source driver for nvidia cards

25991
sudo	passwd
when asked provide your user passwd in order to perform sudo tasks then enter the new unix passwd twice

26014
mouse	keyboard
i assume you have looked at the mouse accessibility options and the keyboard can be set to mimic a mouse not sure if either of these help

26029
kde	gnome
also you can actually connect from command line and reinstall gnome or kde or whatever de you are using

26033
kde	gnome
i would like to use some kde plasma widgets but don t want to install kde and don t want to lose my current gnome setup

26045
flac	ogg
i have most of my music in flac on my large storage device and would like to automatically re-encode it in ogg vorbis when copying it to my portable audio player sansa fuze v2

26089
youtube	vimeo
i ve tried using xinerama twinview but if one of these option are enabled in etc xorg.conf flash videos in chromium like on youtube or vimeo doesn t play nicely clicking full screen plays the video but not in fullscreen

26106
screens	tablet
just got my netbook edition of ubuntu working with my tablet touch screens about 3 seconds ago.

26127
folder	dir
or you can individualy make a dir in your home folder

26191
folder	directory
this folder is owned by the root user who has permission to write to this directory owner root group root mode 0755

26191
folder	directory
ubuntu creates additional directory in that folder like videos in which you can put your downloaded videos

26201
notepad++	scite
that being said since notepad++ is based on scintilla scite is probably worth checking out

26230
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu as in other linux systems files are arranged in a single tree with everything under the root directory

26230
sudo	passwd
in ubuntu root normally has no passwd and normal users gain permission to modify files owned by other users including root with the use of sudo

26288
mouse	keyboard
after about 10 mins or less of using it mouse froze but the ps 2 keyboard still worked rebooting only fixed the issue temporarily

26363
debian-based	linux
apt-get is a tool specific to debian-based linux distributions and will only download packages from locations specified in etc apt source.lst

26364
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
that is better than installing from source code as now files are tracked by dpkg backend for apt aptitude and other package managers in ubuntu

26389
uninstall	upgrade
i can t upgrade install or uninstall anything at all

26415
folder	directory
changed the owner of home directory and all nested files and folder to be me

26425
mouse	keyboard
keyboard becomes totaly unresponsive while mouse still works i can move cursor but can t click since desktop freezes and music still plays and i can connect trough ssh

26425
ati	nvidia
my home dekstop with proprietery nvidia driver on my work where i use noveau driever opensource driver for geforce and sometimes but rarely also on laptop with ati graphics using r300g driver which is really good

26425
mouse	keyboard
can someone explains why mouse still works while i can t input from keyboard

26425
mouse	keyboard
i can t switch to virtual console or do r-e-i-s-u-b command i have usb keyboard and usb mouse

26426
mouse	keyboard
both my keyboard and mouse both use the wireless receiver and they both worked with no fiddling at all.........work perfect mx 3200 lazer

26439
fish	bash
i put in my .bashrc to run fish which works fine but ubuntu recognizes it as fish running inside bash which means that when i try to close the shell it warns me that a task is still running

26440
fish	bash
to set it back to bash you need to use fish syntax of course like this chsh -s which bash

26448
mouse	keyboard
mouse keyboard and usb harddisk

26452
cvs	svn
in its core git clients and git servers for real git is distributed system not so much central server and clients exists unlike in svn or cvs but for sure you can treat a git repository as the master one communicate through the network so no gui is needed here

26502
g++	gcc
so what we need to do is remove the gcc symlink and the g++ symlink and then recreate them linked to gcc 4.3 and g++ 4.3

26502
g++	gcc
now if we check the symbolic links again we will see gcc g++ are now linked to gcc 4.3 and g++ 4.3

26508
ubuntu	debian
normally in debian the revisions are just numbers such but for ubuntu the ubuntu1 following the revision indicates that there are source changes to that debian revision

26508
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	debian
this is common when the ubuntu package has been upgrade to a new upstream versioning ahead of debian

26512
ubuntu	linux
then configure ubuntu to prepare the swap space for use by linux on start up

26517
ati	nvidia
i have an nvidia card using vdpau with the proprietary driver so i m not sure what options there are for hardware accelerated video on ati cards

26518
g++	gcc
first erased the current update-alternatives setup for gcc and g++

26518
g++	gcc
we will install symbol links for gcc and g++ then link cc and c++ to gcc and g++ respectively

26518
g++	gcc
the last step is configuring the default commands for gcc g++

26532
ubuntu	linux
one thing i ve really liked about unix linux ubuntu over the years is that i can reliably run my laptop for months without rebooting suspending only except when i install a new kernel

26569
folder	directory
currently i am doing then manually cut-pasting the files from the tmp directory to the original folder

26601
mouse	keyboard
the only usb attachment is a mouse keyboard

26618
exponent	modulo
options bits exponent modulo

26635
bluetooth	usb
all of a sudden pavucontrol does remember my settings.now when i plugin my usb headset skype automatically gets routed to the headset and rhythmbox gets routed to my bluetooth receiver

26649
mouse	keyboard
as someone above has posted in a comment it seems to be mouse or keyboard activity that keeps the machine awake

26660
flac	ogg
if you can treat your device as a usb mass storage device you might be able to use .is_audio_player to trick banshee into thinking that your device only supports ogg vorbis not flac

26662
rss	feed
rss feed in which case you should

26673
mp4	webm
i ve already created a nice webm encoding but can t create the equivalent mp4 video

26689
ubuntu	linux
the other option is to use a ubuntu live disk and boot into a linux os to snoop around

26695
ubuntu	linux
therefore i am searching for a hardware raid controller which is well supported by linux ubuntu reporting smart values stats for the harddrives etc...

26762
google-chrome	firefox
while firefox works fine chromium gives error 105 net err_name_not_resolved for all sites except google searches if i type anything in the smart-search bar of google-chrome i get the search results

26762
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome on windows are also working fine

26770
ethernet	wireless
look for some thing with similar names to en being ethernet wl being wireless

26783
folder	directory
in .config chromium default extensions a hidden folder inside your home directory

26796
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way i can truly embed it in firefox like the google-chrome pdf reader

26827
ethernet	wireless
if you are communicating on the ethernet or wireless you are open to sniffing

26829
folder	directory
at first i thought i had to setup an ftp account but searched more and i found some information that says that i need to change the permissions of the wp-content folder which is located in the directory

26838
kde	gnome
btw there are several font viewer manager which includes but not limits to fontforge and kfontview for kde also running in gnome

26865
opera	firefox
moreover i changed in gnome in system- preferences- preferred applications opera as web browser and i checked in firefox that it should warn if firefox is not the default browser obviously it isn t anymore

26892
daemons	systemd
looking at the log file it would seem that the ntp daemons is running but the systemd clock never seems to be set however

26896
mouse	keyboard
it worked when switching from the win7 machine to the ubuntu one but after the 1st and only successful switch ubuntu just didn t seem to recognize my mouse or keyboard

26896
mouse	keyboard
when i switched over to ubuntu by doing a scroll-lock scroll-lock my keyboard and mouse were not recognized

26896
mouse	keyboard
however the lights on the keyboard and mouse did work when on ubuntu but they didn t function and since keyboard wouldn t function i couldn t do a scroll-lock scroll-lock to switch back to the win7 machine

26896
mouse	keyboard
so i was basically locked in to ubuntu with no mouse or keyboard and i had to unplug the keyboard mouse usb s and d-sub to plug the monitor d-sub back into win7 computer to type up this thread and google the issue

26896
mouse	keyboard
but there isn t any for kvm switches at least not this one also i never was unable to find ubuntu drivers firmware for my mouse and keyboard logitech g15 and razer deathadder 3500

26899
ubuntu	opensuse
there is no need to remove ubuntu before you install opensuse

26916
ubuntu	linux
does linux ubuntu have these apps

26926
rss	feed
no there is currently no rss feed of releases

26940
daemons	systemd
ntp daemons don t want to do a sudden massive jump in systemd time

26940
daemons	systemd
for one it borks the chronology of entries in your log files systemd daemons might freak out etc

26951
appindicator	gobject
unfortunately appindicator doesn t allow adding custom widget as it requires gobject introspection

26953
cpu	processors
processors 4x intel r core tm i5 cpu m 540 2.53ghz

26979
kde	gnome
unity is still nice for notebooks with small displays but there is no big advantage on the desktop compared with other desktop environments like gnome 2 3 or kde

26983
versioning	upgrade
but at some point i upgrade my kernel versioning not sure what uname -a prints but it s related and it stopped working

26983

if your root partition is on lvm software raid of xfs filesystem- separate boot is mandatory

27030
int	chars
int len chars strlen

27050
chown	chmod
i already tried changing the chmod of the symlink which changes the ones from the original file of course and also a chown to the user from webserver but no matter what i tried i cannot open the file from the web or from a php-script which is what i want to do

27073
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
is there a modern i mean excluding ext2 3 as they are obsolete for general usage when there is ext4 today free-born i mean excluding fat and ntfs filesystems working equally good in ubuntu and windows maybe after installing some extra drivers or any active project of such

27077
google-chrome	firefox
try xmarks - even though it stores your bookmarks on a server to synchronise with each browser it is installed on available for firefox google-chrome and internet explorer you also have the local data in the browser installation folder

27083
versioning	upgrade
how do i pin a particular mysql versioning to avoid unnecessary upgrade

27085
debian	linux
if you want stability to the point of using somewhat old linux technology then debian is for you - it s virtually bug-free

27105
ubuntu	debian
in one equation ubuntu features with inherited stability from debian debian stability with features added from ubuntu

27105
ubuntu	debian
why i don t use an ubuntu lts over a debian stable

27141
versioning	upgrade
i have installed and upgrade all of the libimobiledevice versioning

27147
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu has made a tremendous difference for novices in the linux world

27161
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
at the moment i use a mixture of ubuntu and linux mint however initially i had difficulty making the transition to ubuntu and linux in general because i was worried about what would happen to my working machine

27163
versioning	upgrade
this should upgrade your package libimobiledevice to versioning 1.0.4 from 1.0.1 enabling you to access your iphone

27166
ubuntu	debian
my largest problem came when everything started becoming ubuntu branded - first the software center why not send upstream patches to debian s synaptic

27195
freebsd	linux
it runs on linux mac os x and freebsd

27196
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
it runs on gnu linux solaris freebsd os x and windows and can be ported to other posix-conformant platforms

27202
apache	lighttpd
after install if you use one of supported web servers apache and lighttpd

27213
ubuntu	linux
what is the ubuntu linux equivalent to this path

27251
ubuntu	linux
when using it from ubuntu i only need a specific directory of it which i like to have mounted into a dedicated directory under my linux fs root

27260
ubuntu	linux
you can use apt-get command to remove delete oracle express edition server from the ubuntu linux

27260
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu uses a bash linux shell

28333
installation	upgrade
after installation i ve updated the system sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade

28351
daemons	systemd
i can only speculate as to why it was removed but my guess would be multiple bugs such as 100 cpu when the tracker daemons failed or the slow start up on less powerful systemd due to the indices updating

i ve tried xfce as well but it seems to take even more memory than gnome

kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
kubuntu is really ubuntu with a kde desktop instead of gnome

29005
disk	ram
one thing that may help is setting up your swap partition for speed - with that little ram things will swap to disk and any ram-based tasks become disk-limited

29006
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for the livecd is a blank passwd just press return when prompted

29118
post	get
i have seen post out about how to get the desktop environment running on ubuntu server but they seem complicated and never seem to equal the standard desktop install

29119
stdout	stderr
that should catch both stdout and stderr and report if there is any syntax error etc

29131
ati	nvidia
however the proprietary fglrx driver for ati has caught up very much with the proprietary nvidia

29131
ati	nvidia
one area where ati still lacks is hd video playback where there is no equivalent of nvidia s vdpau

29132

29154

i mean there is a new versioning coming out every 6 months so it will be convenient if we are able to upgrade without losing on the data

29200
mouse	trackpad
it works as a basic mouse point and click but had no functionality for edge scrolling or any of the multitouch settings the trackpad is capable of

29200
mouse	trackpad
i discovered the reason is a known issue where the ubuntu kernel will improperly detect an elantech trackpad as a logitech ps 2 wheel mouse and as such will gain none of the functionality that seems to be coded for synaptics trackpads

29205
versioning	upgrade
it is recommended that you upgrade from progressive versioning or lts releases only

29253

i am using ubuntu 10.10 linux pc07 2.6.35-27-generic #48-ubuntu smp tue feb 22 20 25 46 utc 2011 x86_64 gnu linux and the default python package python 2.6.6

29254
mouse	keyboard
the mouse and keyboard are not responding and i am not able to do a ssh

29311
wan	lan
you could also just set up a dropbox share between the boxes as i recall it attempt to serve files via lan before resorting to wan

29364
daemons	systemd
by default the command useradd doesn t create home directories but for a daemons i recommend you to use the systemd option and change the shell to a non-existent one so no one can login with said account in ssh for example

29377
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and linux in general don t support gpu switching yet

29387

it isn t fully supported by ubuntu and linux kernel

i foolishly upgrade my firefox install on ubuntu to the beta 4 release i believe by adding the ppa repository -- is there an easy way to roll it back to the 3.6 versioning provided by ubuntu

29495
hide	show
for example if you write in dolphin address bar home user .bashrc it will open the file with default editor without toggling show hide some files

29496
ubuntu	linux
i would try to check what tools settings- display driver configuration tool you have that shows configuration as it is working for you now and in that tool change the settings as far as my experience - ubuntu can be configured the common linux way but then ubuntu configuration tools kick in and override settings in xorg or wherever you set them

29509
versioning	upgrade
even if this were allowed by the archive the package managers on your system wouldn t consider it to be an upgrade and so you d keep the newer versioning

29521
chmod	sudoers
chmod 0440 etc sudoers

29538
dpkg	apt
once you have the packages and you re back on your low-bandwidth system either stick them in var cache apt archives and run the standard sudo apt-get install mysql-server or simply cd into the directory where the packages are and run sudo dpkg -i .deb

29705
ubuntu	linux
whether you re an experienced linux user or you re just getting started with open-source software there are lots of ways to get involved with the ubuntu community

29728
vmware	virtualbox
for the sake of merely testing a desktop virtualisation product like virtualbox or vmware would be the easiest way to get started

29728
xen	openvz
if you are looking for a long term solution there are other options like kvm openvz and xen

29747
kubuntu	gnome
i have the idea that ubuntu adds a new list for it s desktop versions with gubuntu a pure gnome 3.0 edition of ubuntu just like kubuntu so the entire list of ubuntu may be like this

29756
folder	directory
some apps install the main app in your home directory but some libraries or multimedia files such as icons in other folder

29756
folder	directory
other folder depends on what you have installed and or modified eg xampp is installed on the opt directory and the configuration files reside in its own folder

29756
installation	upgrade
no grub is never removed it may be upgrade but this wont affect at all you windows installation

29759

i know it is possible to install ubuntu debs on debian but some will simply not install because of dependencies

29759
ubuntu	debian
is there a easy way to install ubuntu debs on debian

29803
ubuntu	debian
generally it is quite unlikely that programs built for ubuntu will work on debian as ubuntu builds with stack smashing protection ssp by default which requires a set of helper functions that are ordinarily found in libssp but included with libc on ubuntu

29809
disk	ram
when hibernating the system saves whatever is in ram to the disk and if there is not enough room in swap the system will complain and not allow you to hibernate

ubuntu	linux	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux
i ve read about how source-based linux distros like gentoo can have considerable performance increases when compared to pre-built distros like ubuntu because they install from source with optimizations for your particular system

29862
folder	directory
a workaround that i have used is changing the directory of a user folder which i don t use to the directory of the folder of which the icon must be changed and after that replacing the icon files of that user folder

29862
folder	directory
changing the directory of a user folder can be done by editing the file .config user-dirs.dirs

29862
folder	directory
in this file you can change the directory of your user folder

29862
folder	directory
for example if you want to change the directory for your public folder to the directory of your dropbox folder change the line

29862
folder	directory
assuming that your dropbox folder is located in your home directory

29862
folder	dir	folder	directory
replace the first parameter dir to icon.png with the location of your icon the second parameter is the parent directory of the folder where the icons are stored the third parameter is the name of the icons that need to be replaced this parameter is optional if the script is used for a different purpose

29884
tunnel	packets
i should note that openvpn will be like tunnel with addresses for ipsec it will be tunnel mode where it will check packets from certain place going to other certain place and ecrypt decrypt accordingly that way for ipsec to make actual tunnel you will have to use some simpler tunnel like ipip or gre over ipsec encryption

29911
ubuntu	debian
i use rtorrent on a headless server to serve debian and ubuntu isos works quite well and can saturate my network link

29918
tex	lilypond
lilypond is like tex for scoresheets in the official repos is a bit old since i want to use some brand-new features

29921
versioning	upgrade
lock the versioning of the package so it won t get upgrade

29954

29963
sudo	passwd
regarding your software installation passwd there is no way to default this that i m aware of as sudo will ask you for a passwd

29965

there s a multitude of reasons why having passwd protection on sudo actions or login but if you really need to not do this you can do it like this

i.e. for btrfs installation it will automatically snapshot before any apt install upgrade remove operation

i doubt that cifs will be able to create junctions on a windows share although i see that smb supports ioctl-style calls so there might be a chance that a savvy client can coerce a windows server into creating a junction

google-chrome	firefox
another option one that i use a lot is notestack.me - it is a html5-based program that has offline sync in google-chrome firefox and any other web browser that supports the localstorage spec

typically even if you bond the interfaces successfully and configure the switch to support the etherchannel then you will still find that only one interface in the bond is used for each pair of source destination tcp udp session

32220
arp	tcp	arp	udp	udp	tcp
perhaps you have a better switch that allows for the port channel to utilise both cards simultaneously in one tcp udp session but it would require some pretty funky arp mac manipulation and i have no idea if the bonding module in linux supports that

it would be best if the method is cross-environment works in unity gnome kde etc but unity is what i am using so that is the most important to me

36465
xfce	gnome
i d like to install the xfce interface alongside the gnome interface that comes preinstalled with ubuntu

36465
xfce	gnome
is there a way to install the xfce desktop alongside gnome without causing ubuntu-desktop to break

36485
versioning	upgrade
will all of my applications and settings be saved by and upgrade and will all of my files be saved and carry over to the new versioning

36485
installation	upgrade
also is it really worth it to upgrade or should i really just wipe clean with a fresh installation

36492
jobs	cron
munin and a munin-node job are run every 5 minutes as cron jobs using files in etc cron.d

36493
ati	nvidia
if you prefer a bit more performance and accept an out of the box in the second attempt experience you should consider buying a nvidia or ati card the only thing needed here is to install the proprietary driver on the first start

36522
emacs	gedit
you would start with an editor with syntax highlighting like gedit scite emacs vi or something else

36528
g++	gcc
it works the same way as gcc compiling a test.cpp file using g++ by typing g++ test.cpp -o mytest which will create a file called mytest which is executable by typing . mytest using the code from test.cpp

36533
folder	dir
current i have changed the var www folder into a symbolic link to the workspace in my hone dir home valorin workspace

36553
google-chrome	firefox
for me videos will be mainly desktop via vlc or web via firefox google-chrome html5 flash silverlight quicktime

36582
ati	nvidia
the error means that your 3d graphics are not enabled for unity to work ok the error message and go into classic desktop and install your 3rd party graphics for nvidia or ati if that s what you have then on next boot unity should work fine.

36593
vmware	virtualbox
if you want rock-solid stability then stay with either a dual-boot ubuntu windows installation or you can use a good virtual solution such as virtualbox or vmware

36593
ati	nvidia
since photoshop is graphically intensive you perhaps should consider running this virtually only if you have a very good graphics card - you should also consider installing any proprietary driver such as nvidia or ati catalyst

36608
udp	tcp
i have added the preset samba service in and out and even tried adding the ports manually 135-139 445 udp and tcp in and out but it still blocks samba

36612
mouse	keyboard
unity keyboard mouse shortcuts

36635
vmware	virtualbox
i recommend to use something like virtualbox or vmware and record the windows with virtual machines inside.

36664
put	get
you could get a compact flash to ide converter both laptop and desktop ide plugs are available and a flash card and put your os on that

36675
kde	gnome	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m looking to install the linux mint environment on top of ubuntu preferably with the option of switching between the normal ubuntu gnome environment and mint like you would switch between gnome and kde

36675
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
the cinnamon desktop environment used in linux mint can be installed with ubuntu using the following command

36675
ubuntu	mint
hopefully this helps anyone who comes to this question looking for how to install the mint desktop environment on top of ubuntu

36676
kde	gnome
it s not possible to switch like gnome and kde

36683
daemons	systemd
gvfsd is the daemons process for the gnome virtual file systemd gvfs

36723
kde	gnome
i tried disabling compiz and have the same issue in both gnome and kde i was wondering if theres an xorg.conf change that could be made to fix this as i have already set the resolution and refresh rates to the correct values

36737
folder	directory
if there are security concerns then you might have to give everyone their own passworded folder on shared directory which involves a little more back work on your part but will save you a lot of work in the long term

36755
imagemagick	mogrify
imagemagick has a tool called mogrify

36798
g++	gcc
codeblocks actually uses g++ not gcc

36830
ubuntu	linux
30 seconds is an ordinary time taken for startup - not just for ubuntu but also for other linux based operating

36841
ubuntu	linux
what is a up-to-date good book that talks about general usage of ubuntu or linux in general but that applies to ubuntu as well

36847
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	linux	debian	mint	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian	gentoo	mint
with this i mean that what you learn in redhat fedora open suse linux mint debian gentoo and others you have a very high chance that you can use them in ubuntu and vice versa

36859
chown	sudo
you can try to claim ownership of all the files by doing sudo chown -r yourusername to set the owner of all files back to your user account

36859
sudo	chgrp
for a complete fix you would then have to do sudo chgrp -r yourusername as well to get everything back into your group as well

36862
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu noob here and my installation just choked with the sbin init error

36868
debian	linux
i just installed it on debian after this manual and so far i can connect windows xp and dabian ther is no linux client howto but i used a linux-active directory howto and it worked

36868
kerberos	ldap
to set this up do not install kerberos or ldap it is shipped with the installation in this howto

36886
versioning	upgrade
on a side note this is also the safest way to perform an upgrade to a new versioning of the bitcoin software-- backup everything then delete everything except the wallet.dat file

36910
google-chrome	firefox
my default installation 11.04 has assigned super + 2 to firefox and super + 3 to google-chrome

36910
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to assign super + f to firefox and super + c to google-chrome

36911
ubuntu	linux
my friends tell to me about new nvidia linux driver and can supports ubuntu 11.04 but i can t install on my ubuntu right now because the extensions it s different .run not .deb

36923
ethernet	wireless
you may try the following connect to your ethernet start the additional drivers program and search to find if it detects and non free drivers your wireless card

36928

they talk about ubuntu and to a certain extent linux in general

37032
put	get
what kind of templates can i install and where do i put them - or where can i get more information on this

37033

with pulseaudio i have to lower the wave volume from my mixer alsamixer to remove static cracking noises

37052
rsa	dsa
or since you are on localhost try copyting your ssh key rsa or dsa inside a file

37063
versioning	upgrade
sorry for too much questions but i m asking this because you know in windows any versioning upgrade would require the disk to be reformatted

37070
ati	nvidia
following on from my last question laptop with nvidia optimus i am looking for a new current laptop with a decent supported graphics card preferably nvidia but maybe ati to run ubuntu on

37095
daemons	systemd
filesystem fragmentation and to allow systemd daemons such as

37122
ati	nvidia
it should be noted that optimus is different from the older ability to switch between the integrated usually intel and discrete nvidia ati graphics systems

37140
installation	upgrade
format and install from zero or upgrade my current 10.10 ubuntu installation

37140
installation	upgrade
if i upgrade my current ubuntu is it possible that i will not have the same look and feel of a fresh installation

37147
ubuntu	linux
what are the differences in feature set between the main linux kernel and the kernel being used by ubuntu

37168
mouse	keyboard
i ll take anything -- keyboard shortcut command line command or mouse action

37184
xfce	gnome
you can also use gnome or xfce but keep in mind that both may get stressed under a heavy work load with that little memory though you should be safe either way if you are only doing the basics like web browsing word processing etc

37187
cpu	processors
in case your cpu supports hardware virtualization most modern processors do you are able to run a 64-bit guest virtual machine on a 32-bit host by using virtual box see here for reference

37187
versioning	upgrade
if you need to run 64-bit applications i would strongly recommend an upgrade of your system to an amd64 ubuntu versioning

37209
ubuntu	linux
linux and ubuntu is good for many reasons but this has nothing to do with viruses

37209
ubuntu	linux
however running ubuntu or linux in general lets you be statistically less prone to get infected by viruses

37209
ubuntu	linux
in no way ubuntu is stronger towards viruses i can write one tomorrow pack it in a .deb and it would be insidious and destructive also because people think linux has no viruses

37216
ubuntu	linux
there are distros based in this de such as bodhi linux but you can install it click here in any ubuntu and then logout and before log back in choose enlightenment

37244
xfce	gnome
given your configuration i would suggest xfce it is pretty good and very similar to gnome 2 but light on resources

37257
hide	show
1 whenever i press the super key or try to show the bottom menu i get a strange flickering the whole screen gets munched up while it animates to show hide

37265
ubuntu	linux
what i need to know is can i use xp on vb to set it up and then have it work through linux since it doesn t support linux use it only on vbox through ubuntu or would it even work

37267
youtube	vimeo
in maverick there was an option to download flash videos from sites like youtube vimeo etc

37283
daemons	systemd
is there any daemons in ubuntu which constantly monitors systemd and execute script for specified cases like ram uses increased 90

37305
google-chrome	firefox
100 cpu usage when streaming flash video with google-chrome but firefox use less than 50 of my cpu usage

37339
cpu	processors
how much host cpu - roughly cores multiplied by number of processors

37339
vmware	esx
red-hat cent os have a similar feature as vmware esx where kvm can page in page out memory segments shared by different os s - hence you can squeeze even more vms

37345
rss	feed
rss feed download torrents files with a click

37356
versioning	upgrade
it makes no difference if you upgrade or install the final versioning from scratch

37372
installation	upgrade
ubuntu distribution upgrade are designed to be done over existing installation and the process should go fairly smoothly thanks to the wonders of package management

37393
ubuntu	debian
ok just recognized there is no rubygems 1.3.7 in the ubuntu repository debian actually has a 1.6 in sid...

37418
ati	nvidia
with nvidia products is almost similar with amd ati with the big exception that the open-source driver receives no support from nvidia

37447
versioning	upgrade
if you can t upgrade to a newer ubuntu 10.10 you can grab an older versioning of mysql-workbench

37470
postfix	dovecot
i have installed email server with dovecot postfix postfixadmin etc

37470
postfix	dovecot
making symbolic link to media emaildrive from home vmail or configure postfix and dovecot to use media emaildrive vmail

37474
sudo	passwd
log in using your normal username and pass word and type sudo killall xorg which after entering your passwd again will kill xorg and force it to restart back to the login screen

37577
kde	kubuntu
download the kubuntu iso if you re using kubuntu kde

37601
filesystems	btrfs
to what extent if at all would creating a btrfs filesystems within a raid5 array mitigate this

37655
versioning	upgrade
make a system backup before you upgrade so you can easily go back if you don t like the new versioning

37697
pull	push
gwibber uses the oauth method to associate your twitter account and push pull data to and from twitter

37697
rss	feed
if you page isn t protected you can use your rss feed and a desktop rss aggregator for read only mode

37700
dpkg	apt
i ve heard that i can dump the dpkg package list of currently installed applications then after i re-install re-import that list and have apt or dpkg do all the heavy lifting for me getting my apps re-installed

37718
rss	feed
unfortunately twitter doesn t support rss feed anymore

37738
kde	gnome
you just need to install a clean desktop environment try gnome or kde for starters this will give you a graphical interface without the extra software each distribution is coming with

37741
mp3	ogg
note that this will work if you ripped the files to mp3 but not for ogg files as there is no standard way to embed album arts in ogg files afaik

37745
hash	md5
md5 sha-1 sha-256 hash are available in the actual releases folder

37771
ubuntu	opensuse
i m planning to have an ubuntu 11.4 opensuse 11.4 or maybe an ubuntu 11.4 fedora 15 beta dual boot or the three of them

37777
jobs	cron
i want to run a script on a daily basis and figured that i d use the same setup that the other cron jobs are configured on this server - by placing the script in the etc cron.daily folder

37777
jobs	cron
t run but don t find the answers anywhere near satisfactory - sudo crontab -l tells me there is no crontab for root although i know i can created one and it would make more sense to use the same method as the preinstalled jobs anyway rather than split cron configuration

37795
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r hadoop usr local hadoop

37805
width	height
it is possible to resize grippers or hide them by setting width and height to a zero

37816
ubuntu	opensuse
be careful with opensuse - they still use grub as their bootloader while ubuntu uses grub2

37816
ubuntu	opensuse
as of 11.4 there is an option to go with grub2 however. if you re using ubuntu as your primary os and replace grub2 with grub during an opensuse install it might cause problems

37816
ubuntu	opensuse
after the install you need to run sudo update-grub from ubuntu to add opensuse to the bootloader

37816
ubuntu	opensuse
this was the option i went with since i wanted to keep ubuntu s bootloader. the only downside to doing it this way is that whenever opensuse updates their kernel you have to update the grub manually from within ubuntu - at least that s the easiest way imo

37864
ubuntu	linux
is there any script code to find which packages i have installed after linux installation or packages other than default so that i can install them in new ubuntu version in one chance rather than on requirements again

37865
installation	upgrade
why not just directly upgrade your 10.10 installation to 11.04

37876
mouse	keyboard
s keyboard and mouse shortcuts

37896
mouse	keyboard
s keyboard and mouse shortcuts

37952
sudoers	passwd
otherwise to avoid the passwd prompt you need to tweak into etc sudoers file to say that that command can be executed without a passwd but also without a passwd you need to run it through gsku

37974
button	checkbox
you ll want to go in the connection s configuration settings under the ipv4 settings tab click the routes button and check the checkbox marked use this connection only for the resouces on its network

37978
kde	gnome
in my experience kvpnc tends to work well and supports a few vpn systems although it requires the installation of additional dependencies from a standard gnome desktop because of qt and kde libraries

37982
mouse	keyboard
a clipboard manager for the gnome desktop it can store text from both keyboard and mouse so you can easily access the clipboard using a hotkey

38001

versioning	upgrade
what should i expect to encounter with a program which works great under wine right now after a versioning upgrade

38013
switching	screens
it can control window decorations screens rotation through xrandr switching between metacity or compiz compositing provide acerhk support and more

38041
mouse	trackpad
i don t recall how many options there were for sensitivity but unlike the built-in mouse settings screen this one regognized the trackpoint and trackpad independently and allowed for greater control like setting the scroll button was button 2 in my configuration and enabling palm detection sensitivity

38061
switching	screens
in classic gnome2 desktop i could install compiz and customize it with compiz config settings manager so that clicking on a specific screens location allowed switching between open windows

38101
filesystems	btrfs
today when i went ahead with natty installation i had selected btrfs for root filesystems

38110
filesystems	btrfs
there is neither a fsck tool available in case the btrfs filesystems becomes corrupt after a power failure for example

38110
filesystems	btrfs
the btrfs filesystems is considered experimental in this release

38110
filesystems	btrfs
while btrfs is stable on a stable machine it is currently possible to corrupt a filesystems irrecoverably if your machine crashes or loses power on disks that don t handle flush requests correctly

38110
filesystems	btrfs
grub can actually boot from btrfs filesystems instructions but note that ubuntu still consider btrfs as experimental

38121
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is the future of filesystems check

38127
stdout	stderr
please note that the pipe will catch stdout only errors to stderr are not processed by the pipe with tee

38127
stdout	stderr
this means run command and redirect the stderr stream 2 to stdout 1

38168
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
if you re not using gnome but kde kubuntu you would find it under kickoff menu - applications - system - konsole

38175
ubuntu	linux
there is no support for the optimus based nvidia graphics in linux ubuntu yet

38179
google-chrome	firefox
i have no problem with google-chrome firefox eclipse ubuntu software center pidgin and many more applications

38224
ubuntu	linux
did you try to install hp software as i know there is an hp driver and tool for linux but before you install it try to remove the printers already define by ubuntu

38234
ubuntu	linux	filesystems	ntfs
if you install ubuntu on windows filesystems many of the linux included software will not apply including so many filesystems check tools and permissions too so you will not really have a secure system as i know linux does not support windows filesystems ntfs so permissions like read write and execute will be limited

38246
subtract	add
when i right click on sda1 and choose resize i am unable to add space to the partition only subtract

38259
mouse	keyboard
if it seems you cant use the keyboard and mouse then hold alt + printscreen keys and type r e

38285
google-chrome	firefox
in particular i m wondering if they are going to add support for searching google-chrome firefox bookmarks and empathy contacts

38288
rss	feed
they both have rss feed and update a couple times a day on average with new information

i plan on installing debian squeeze ubuntu natty in a dual-boot scenario

i want to upgrade my home desktop to narwal and switch from gnome to kde

38310
mouse	keyboard
s keyboard and mouse shortcuts

38344
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade from a beta - am i now running the official non development versioning

38353
vim	gedit
but you can use any other text editors to edit files like gedit vim etc

38364
sudo	passwd
sudo for installation or system changes you need to enter a passwd not just say yes as in vista or win7

38364
ubuntu	linux
most safe is a linux like ubuntu

38394
folder	directory
in the files and folder lens in natty it lists all the folder in my home directory as favourite folder

38407
versioning	upgrade
typically upgrade versioning require some versioning of windows to be present at the computer before they allow themselves to be installed

38412
kde	gnome
i installed kde as a backup awhile back but i really would prefer to have gnome back

38461
ubuntu	linux
i originally installed ubuntu 10.10 using wubi so i could have windows and linux to choose from at boot up

38474
versioning	upgrade
is using the upgrade when you already have an older versioning of ubuntu running exactly the same in the end as installing fresh

38479
versioning	upgrade
yes but with the upgrade all your installed programs and their dependencies are updated to match the versioning in the natty repositories example app is at versioning 1.0 in 10.10 but in 11.04 example app is 1.2 as example app is available via the ubuntu repositories

38487
ubuntu	linux
this is my first experience with gnome and ubuntu and linux -- i have no experience and my searches are of little help

38491
versioning	upgrade
as a conclusion if you upgrade all application that you download from ubuntu sources will be safe and upgrade if there is a new versioning and all your data will be safe

38531
google-chrome	firefox
this means that i can open and show the png image with firefox but i also have google-chrome in that list

38531
google-chrome	firefox
only firefox appears highlighted instead of firefox and google-chrome

38545
switching	screens
if you still don t see the login screens switching back to the f1 screens and you should be able to login from the command line which will allow you to get some more information about your system

38626
ubuntu	linux
i ve tried installing col on ubuntu linux

38630
switching	screens
whenever the screens is locked either by menu or by switching users bug buddy show up saying the screensaver has crashed then the entire session freezes up and can t do anything

38651
ubuntu	linux
one of the reasons my friend keeps giving me against ubuntu and linux in general is the lack of really good software

38653
pop-up	dialog
immediately after this a dialog box pop-up giving me the same error as i pasted above

38666
pop-up	dialog
a dialog will pop-up giving you the option to run the script in a terminal

38735
filesystems	ntfs
the whole .exe must be executable - is a nice way to put another layer of security on things but when the .exe is on a filesystems that you can not make the .exe executable such as on an iso or remote share or ntfs vfat mounted with options where its not the default it can cause problems

38757
kde	gnome
not only on kde but also on gnome unity etc

38758
ubuntu	linux
i am experiencing very strange problems with nautilus in my ubuntu linux

38783
kde	gnome
and god forbid you install a kde application in gnome then you get even more file indexers and recently used tracking

38911
width	height
i like the new shortcuts in 11.04 with the numpads but i would like for example ctrl+alt+num5 to make the window with a lower height just like the width

38914
folder	directory
my music directory is a mess with folder names

38965
width	height
# to make the window with a lower height just like the width

38994
ubuntu	linux
i was hoping the issues would be fixed in the brand new version of ubuntu but i guess not i m tired of windows but it seems to be impossible to use linux on a hp envy

39044
filesystems	ntfs
check and repair filesystems ntfs on dev sda2 00 00 09 error

39065
filesystems	ntfs
as far as i know the linux-based ntfs tools will refuse to touch a ntfs filesystems unless it is already perfectly consistent so as to minimize the chance of data loss

39065
filesystems	ntfs
i vaguely remember the ntfs mount program providing the option to mount a damaged filesystems as read-only so that you could recover data off of it but i could be wrong

39101
ethernet	wireless
was able to connect via ethernet on a friend s modem but wireless remains at device not ready

39149
post	get
is it possible to get the indicator applet the mail icon in the top right of the screen to tell me when someone post something new in particular newsgroups that i m subscribed to

39164
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade to the new versioning of ubuntu 11.04

39232
ubuntu	debian
libswfdec was removed from ubuntu debian so you will not be able to build that file in your maverick ppa

39232
ubuntu	debian
see the ubuntu source package and the debian removal bug

39238
mouse	keyboard
mouse cursor is moving but clicking icons and keyboard shortcuts have no effect

39287
sudoers	visudo
edit sudoers sudo visudo you have to use sudo

39290
sudo	passwd
but be careful with removing passwd for sudo

39294
sudoers	visudo
always edit the sudoers file with sudo visudo as visudo checks for errors and will not save the file if any are found

39334
versioning	upgrade
if wireless was working fine before the upgrade use the maverick versioning of the driver

39345
versioning	upgrade
i made upgrade from ubuntu 10.10 to ubuntu 11.04 amd64 versioning at my dell studio 1558 notebook

39405
folder	directory
therefore i must open the music folder then navigate through the entire directory tree to open the file i want

39462
mouse	keyboard
in gnome desktop on lucid i had it configured so that using the ubuntu system keyboard mouse i could use win + c win + v to copy and paste everywhere on the gnome desktop including in firefox and gnome terminal

39471
postgresql	mysql
assuming you are using mysql mediawiki works w postgresql too i think

39473
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
for technical reasons changing the number of desktops or workspaces in environments such as gnome kde and xfce is not the same as changing the number of viewports in compiz

39482
hide	show
a temporary fix that works for me is to right-click the panel and click properties then select and deselect show hide buttons

39531
ubuntu	debian
is it possible to install win 7 ubuntu debian as triple boot

39537
ubuntu	debian
windows 7 first so it doesn t overwrite grub and then ubuntu or debian can be installed in whatever order you please

39549
ubuntu	linux
by default it displays r linux r ubuntu r iama and of course the main stories

39598
folder	directory
to sync settings just sync all those invisible folder in you home username directory

39617
portrait	landscape
the error message says that the maximum desktop size is 1600x1600 which is probably big enough to cover the laptop s display in either landscape or portrait mode but not the external monitor

39729
jobs	cron
by default cron delegates the running of etc cron.daily jobs to anacron

39747
folder	directory
copy home folder launcher file to your home directory with terminal

39778
sudo	passwd
the next time sudo is run a passwd will be required

39778
sudo	passwd
this option does not require a passwd and was added to allow a user to revoke sudo permissions from a .logout file

39836
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
you re running kubuntu which uses kde not unity so when you upgraded you got an updated kubuntu kde sc desktop not the gnome + compiz based unity desktop

39874
installation	upgrade
i had a 10.10 ubuntu installation and upgrade to most recent 11.04

39911
installation	upgrade
by the way this server is originally a 10.04.1 installation that has been upgrade to 10.10 and then to 11.04 if that can have something to do with it

39922
ubuntu	debian
the other answers including the accepted answer are no longer valid for ubuntu 11.04 and newer because they recommended debian packages such as netselect-apt and apt-spy which do not work with ubuntu

39928
powerpc	i386
3.1-14 amd64 i386 powerpc

39962

i m not sure if this is a problem with my ubuntu installation 11.04 upgrade from 10.10 or this is common problem

vmware	virtualbox
you can take your existing vmware images and actually open them in virtualbox without converting the images to vdi ..or you can convert them to vdi if you want too. frankly for non-windows vm s it is probably just as simple to create a new image since installing linux from scratch is so simple

41447
vmware	virtualbox
the one issue that i ran into when opening my vmware images in virtualbox was that i originally split my vmware images into 2gb files

41447

i think i first removed vmware tools from my image and then installed the virtualbox add-ons on the vm and i think that was basically it

how do i get quickly to use git as its default version control instead of bazaar

43723
ubuntu	linux

versioning	upgrade
i have often wondered when an update is made to ext4 for example in the kernel and then more performance updates are made to it and they keep up adding up over time when i upgrade to the latest ubuntu versioning do they get applied to an already internal hard drive that is using ext4 already since 10.04

sudo	passwd
it perhaps is a bug but to write an xorg.config file you need to be root use sudo the nvidia script dosn t always prompt for root passwd and therefore can t write the file

44252
disk	ram
that s because ram isn t just for storing the memory of running processes it s also for caching disk contents

filesystems	fat
per update of your question still you cannot control that in the filesystems other than using a different filesystems type like fat which is strongly discougared you need to do that in your webapp

ubuntu	debian
since ubuntu is debian based should downloading the project for debian suffice and i won t have to do any modification to it

44855
ubuntu	debian
one example i would like to give is code blocks they have a project source file for debian and none for ubuntu

44855

44950
ubuntu	debian
i m currently multi-booting an unencrypted windows system an unencrypted debian system and a luks encrypted ubuntu system which includes both the root partition and swap

ubuntu inherits packages from debian except where there has been a deliberate effort to make some change so any package present in debian will be present in ubuntu barring very unusual circumstances

52546
ubuntu	debian
as these packages do have someone in debian who is responsible for making them work in debian there is a blanket presumption that they will also work in ubuntu which is true for the vast majority of packages but may not be the case for some specific packages

ubuntu also sometimes receives new packages not found in debian while it is hoped that whoever decided to contribute the package to ubuntu will continue to care for it this is not always the case

the least invasive method is to enable repositories containing the versioning of the software you are using although i would expect that you would be upgrade to something based on 1 3.2.1-7ubuntu1 or 1 3.3.0-7ubuntu1 if you are using current backports whether official or from a ppa

with hg pull as well as with sudo hg push everything works fine

52813
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
because linux mint isn t related to ubuntu the way kubuntu and the like are direct offshoots etc... you unfortunately cannot install the linux mint environment on top of the ubuntu de like you can with say kubuntu xubuntu lubuntu etc...you can do a second partition and install linux mint on that and subsequently choose between them at system boot with the grub menu but that s the extent of what you can do in regards to running linux mint on ubuntu.

is it true that each app is designed for its own desktop environment like gnome xfce lxde etc.

official buildds in both debian and ubuntu use sbuild although often not the sbuild available from the archives which is considered an advantage by some developers as they have greater confidence that their configuration matches that to which their package will be exposed when built although if everyone does this we lose the ability to distinguish bugs in policy from bugs in sbuild

pop-up	dialog
that may for example cause the applet to pop-up keyring dialog when secrets are needed

54318
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
the problem is that kubuntu and i believe kde more generally starts the shutdown process in a way different than gnome ubuntu so even the dbus netbase fixes and using autofs that i ve seen proposed in different forums all didn t work

54318
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd

my home otherwise known as directory has lots of hidden configuration folder

55224
ubuntu	debian
i have an ubuntu installed in one partition debian on the other and now i am planning to install backtrack and suse also

55224
ubuntu	debian
debian mounts a separate partition as its home mount point whereas ubuntu contains its own home folder in its file system

55227
ubuntu	debian
if i m reading correctly you should have two partitions for ubuntu swap and root and a few partitions for debian

55227
ubuntu	debian
if you ve mounted the home partition on mnt you d then create home ubuntu and home debian

55227
ubuntu	debian
you then copy home username to mnt ubuntu username and move mnt username to mnt debian username for the debian user

55227
ubuntu	debian
if you have configured both debian and ubuntu to mount that partition in home at boot and changed the users to use the new paths for their homes then everything should be fine

55227
ubuntu	debian
if you do that make sure not to format it otherwise you ll loose the data from debian and ubuntu

55229

for me it was no problem as i had an ethernet connection on my desktop and didn t need the wireless access point i had installed it with the 32-bit version just to see if i could get it to work

55248
dpkg	apt
you can ignore all dependencies with dpkg --force-depends however this will confuse apt when alacarte is involved in a dependency calculation later for example when a newer version of the package appears hence doing this is not recommended

55415
sudo	passwd
but after i typed the sudo passwd for authentication nothing happened

55416
ubuntu	linux
the simple answer is yes the command line structure of linux is the same as the command line structure of ubuntu

55416
ubuntu	linux
currently ubuntu is the most popular linux distribution for personal computers

55416

if someone says do this in linux it will almost certainly be something you can do in ubuntu and there s a good chance that ubuntu was what they had in mind when they said linux

filesystems	ntfs
this doesn t apply to network filesystems mounted from another machine these are designed to be mounted from multiple places at once. exception if the shared partition is ntfs and it s not the windows boot partition it s safe to share at the filesystems level but you d better not keep a file open in a hibernated application so it s better to unmount the shared partition before hibernating anyway

advantages of mp3 to ogg

59396
mp3	ogg
for me ogg vorbis sounds a lot clearer and the file sizes are much smaller than their mp3 equivalent so instead of encoding mp3 at 128kbps i can use ogg s at 64kbps which sounds the same and are half the size

59396
mp3	ogg
also mp3 s are specifically 2 channel audio whereas ogg vorbis can handle up to 256 channel s

59396
mp3	ogg
lastly ogg vorbis format is open-source and free to use on any device where mp3 is proprietary and programmers get paid licensing fee s for it s use

59400
mp3	ogg
that is not possible with mp3 or ogg encoding or any lossy encoding that relies on psychoacoustic models

59403
wav	flac	wav	ogg	flac	ogg
but if you have a lossless source either flac wav cd-audio and you want to convert from that to a smaller lossy format and you don t mind about portability ie you mostly in pc or in players that support it go ahead and use ogg

likely given that you re running nginx and maybe apache port 80 is already used on this machine

60830
apache	nginx
if this is an application that needs web server software to be installed you ll need to setup a virtual host definition in either nginx or apache whichever you re using so that the application will be run when you access it via but setting up the specifics for that seem to be out of scope for the question you ve asked

ati	nvidia
the latest cards from ati hd 4000 and up and nvidia geforce 8 series and up all work great with proprietary drivers under 64bit ubuntu and work reasonably well with open source drivers

61433
ati	nvidia
after this it is recommended to reinstall the video driver if you are using nvidia or ati as mentioned above

61433
ati	nvidia
most installation problems related to ati or nvidia can be solved by following the steps provided in can not install nvidia driver but in short i can summarize that in the following steps assuming you have one of the following issues

61433
ati	nvidia
if you installed the nvidia driver from the nvidia site or the ati driver from the official amd site then type the following on the terminal in this example assume you have the ubuntu 64bit with the 304.51 version of nvidia

61433
ati	nvidia
any change you did to blacklist the nvidia ati driver for instance or changes to any other files related to the nvidia ati drivers should be reversed

61433
ati	nvidia
after doing all the steps above then reboot the pc and make sure it loads with nouveau and not with any nvidia drivers for nvidia cases or with ati drivers and not with fglrx for ati amd cases

61433
ati	nvidia
in this modes and after all previous steps have been done install the nvidia ati driver using the ppa i mentioned above

61433
ati	nvidia
always try to install the latest driver if you have a recent video card sudo apt-get install nvidia-313 for nvidia cards or sudo apt-get install fglrx for the latest ati amd cards

61433
ati	nvidia
remember there should not be anything installed before doing this in regards to nvidia ati drivers except obviously the nouveau drivers

61433
ati	nvidia
i mention this because if the xorg.conf is not used then how is the settings for ati or nvidia working

61461

can anyone recommend a single wireless integrated keyboard and mouse one device with both functions that can connect wirelessly to my computer so that i can navigate type and do all the functionality i have with 2 wired devices

61651
mouse	keyboard
that is to say you ll move the mouse pointer outside of the laptops screen and then you control the other pc with both mouse and keyboard

61651
mouse	keyboard
you can now move the mouse pointer from the laptop and onto the mediacenter and the keyboard and mouse will work as if you had a keyboard and mouse connected to the mediacenter

61677
ubuntu	debian
how can i track the provenance of an ubuntu debian and get some idea if the people who did it are still maintaining it

61711

because of this i would not recommend that you work on such files directly in a synced folder but instead have a working directory and copy your files when you need them synced

61713
switching	screens
since this upgrade the computer will switching to a text screens with what looks like a backtrace or something

61727
dpkg	apt

61730
ubuntu	debian
in contrast to debian ubuntu packages are usually don t have their own maintainer

61730
ubuntu	debian
you could also contact the debian maintainers and see if they are ready to answer ubuntu problem

61764
cpu	processors
i don t have experience doing exactly what you want to do but as an old mac guy i have a lot of experience w g4 processors and a 1.4ghz g4 would be roughly equivalent to a 2.4ghz pentium 4 which according to the passmark site listing all benchmarked cpu s earns a passmark score of 314 which to put in perspective would be roughly in line with a 1st gen atom from the first netbooks that started floating around

61780
folder	directory
so i need a way of merging all the folder inside a directory with a bash script or a program that does that

61787
ftp	smb
i know it is working as i can access it remotely smb ftp or http

61800
portrait	landscape
however i need some more options such as setting the output page size margins and rotation between landscape and portrait format

61800
portrait	landscape
this centers the image on an a4 page and automatically rotates between landscape and portrait however it only works with small images below 595x842

61883
folder	directory
if only you want to use it just copy the files they ll usually be .ttf or .otf files into the .fonts folder in your home directory

61884
post	get
is there any way i can get this error so i can post it

61902
folder	directory
i also seem to remember that ubuntu one doesn t sync files and folder from outside your home directory

is there a gnome application with a gui that enables one to verify a pgp signature something equivalent to kleopatra for kde

61918

chown	chmod
linux permissions aka chmod chown only work on linux file systems

62213
sudo	passwd
sudo then asks you for your passwd not root passwd

62214
sudoers	visudo
after that you can run visudo to open up the sudoers file and edit it to add your user

62220
chmod	sudoers
if you can login as root on rescue mode you can easily change file permission with chmod 440 etc sudoers command

62220
sudoers	visudo
content of etc sudoers or visudo should look like this atleast in my case

62237
filesystems	ntfs
windows filesystems notably fat32 and ntfs and some others do not have a right management like their linux counterparts

62266
ubuntu	linux
don t know the state of all amd drivers but i was told the linux driver for ubuntu that can be downloaded from the amd website will get this done

62271
ati	nvidia
in terms of easier driver management you might be better off with an ati card but in terms of better support for the latest video acceleration tech then i would suggest nvidia

move	drag
one workaround you can do when a window doesn t fit is to click and drag on any area of the window on it while holding the alt key down this will let you move the window up so that you can at least click the buttons on the bottom of windows

ubuntu	linux
i am pretty sure your ubuntu is installed using wubi - there are no linux partitions on the drive

62582
mouse	keyboard
on the server should be 30 ubuntu virtual machines each controlled by a different keyboard and mouse + individual monitor

62594
mouse	keyboard
this doesn t really have to be a bad thing as you can connect to a machine of your friend and help him out solving his problems - he sees the same things on screen as you do and you both can control keyboard and mouse

62606
mouse	keyboard
the client computer needs a keyboard mouse monitor and a network card

redhat	fedora
on fedora redhat centos the less command seems to magically detect a gzipped file and decompress it on the fly so you can do

if anyone knows how this works on centos and or how it can be made to work on ubuntu i d be grateful

62717
mp3	wav
you can create use edit samples from audio files such as wav mp3 midi etc

62721
vmware	virtualbox
somehow it just seems to be insufficient for both virtualbox and vmware

62744
ubuntu	linux
i wouldn t recommend the advanced option unless you know what your doing you need some partitioning knowledge for that along with how linux file things - but these will come with time the more you use ubuntu

62764
folder	directory
you can download the required dll from dll-files.com and then simply copy it into the c windows folder within the wine directory

62766
sudo	passwd
i ve enabled apt-get in sudo without passwd and bash autocompletion for it need to be enabled as well but how

62798
kde	gnome
some apps store them under gnome or kde configuration directories that are also dotfiles in your home directory

ethernet	wireless
it has no wireless card just a wired ethernet card

62875
ethernet	wireless
i did this not that long ago for my brother when i set up ubuntu 11.04 on his desktop and used an ethernet cable between his machine and my ubuntu 11.04 laptop so his desktop could use my laptop s wireless

62897
installation	upgrade
recently installed the oneiric ocelot and its awesome but one fine time i logged out of it and when i logged in the shutdown button disappears when i upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10 got a error message saying that the installation failed due to broken packages and when i restarted it worked.gave this info so that it might give u guys a picture of what happened.had and issue after this with the software center and did t install google chrome from the deb file and had to manually install it from the terminal.had to run the code apt-get install -f

62931
ubuntu	debian
here s an example of the steps involved debian and ubuntu work identically in this respect

62961
ati	nvidia
trade in your laptop for a intel nvidia ati graphics laptop

62967
titlebar	window
if you do not need window borders and a titlebar because you re running virtualbox fullscreen anyway or other fancy display manager functions like alt + tab you will be fine with a simple x server

62972
ethernet	wireless
important firstly ensure that you are connected to the internet either wireless or via fixed ethernet

62975
put	get
get a cd burn your own from iso order one put on another usb key for the right version

62991
mouse	keyboard
apart from what dan said there s another option for copy-pasting text in linux which i m finding much faster and easier to use since there s no need to swich from mouse which you re using to make the selection to keyboard

63022
filesystems	ntfs
i have 2 tb of data on an ntfs drive which i would like to convert to ext4 filesystems

63029
kde	gnome
i think that k3b is superior in terms of stability but to be honest as i gnome user i don t like having to add the qt libraries as k3b was built for kde on my machine

63037
bash	zsh
i m logging in as root using sudo bash or sudo zsh

63046
cifs	smb
previously we could print on osx printers and mount osx file shares in a snap using smb cifs

63046
ubuntu	linux
rumours in the net tell that samba4 is the recipe for linux ubuntu

63047
versioning	upgrade
wait for a couple weeks until oneiric is released - you will then have the very latest stable versioning automatically installed when you upgrade

63055
kde	gnome
gnome developers often value simplicity over features while kde developers prefer more features even if it make the program unsuitable for 3-year-olds

63055
kate	gedit
so if you need this feature - kate is a perfectly good replacement for gedit and has many nice features apart from the ability to change document s encoding

63141
bonjour	avahi
avahi is a zeroconf bonjour dns responder which is not available per default on windows since its an apple invention

63161
ubuntu	linux
it had an ubuntu installer and all but after checking out pricing i was wondering if ubuntu or in the linux community there was a similar product that was free that provided at least a way for customers to communicate with the operators or sellers

63161
ubuntu	debian
its pretty neat but a free version would be nicer and even more if in the debian ubuntu repos

63190
installation	upgrade
the machine where this is happening is an upgrade one and i have seen in several new installation that this is not the expected behaviour

63191
hide	show
sometimes my unity launcher crashes and show and undesirable behaviour although it still hide it leaves a ghost shadow behind it

63193
ubuntu	linux
whether you use windows os x android ios ubuntu or any other gnu linux distro this is equally true

63236
screens	tablet
xrandr will only change the orientation of the screens and not always the orientation of the tablet

63246
ubuntu	linux
if i now try to install ubuntu 11.04 via usb i am avoiding upgrading via package manager because i have had some bad experiences with it and not format my linux partition are there any chances that my data in home or home user1 or home user2 will vanish away

63259
versioning	upgrade
upgrade packages over time updated versioning of packages currently installed on your computer may become available from the package repositories for example security updated

63259
versioning	upgrade
for example to upgrade from ubuntu versioning 5.10 to versioning 6.06 lts you would first ensure the versioning 6.06 lts repositories replace the existing 5.10 repositories in your computer s etc apt sources.list then simply issue the apt-get update command as detailed above and finally perform the actual upgrade by typing

63332
versioning	upgrade
is there an easy way to downgrade to an older versioning like 11.50 which didn t had this problem and still have the possibility to get the upgrade query when the next versioning comes out which hopefully fixes this

63338
versioning	upgrade
i didn t test it but i think uninstalling opera then creating a versioning pin and then installing it again would install an older versioning and then upgrade it to a newer one when it s available

63351
migrate	upgrade
it is on the windows active directory domain 2008 sbs and has been working well for several years migrate to new hardware and upgrade from 8.04 a few months ago

move	drag
which desktop environments allow to drag n drop files data across applications while task-switching using alt-tab without the need to move mouse cursor to a specific ui element and or wait for other ui elements to become active

63361
sudo	passwd
try sudo su and enter your passwd

63413
xfce	gnome
as per the desktop application autostart specification which ubuntu and all major desktop environments like gnome lxde xfce follow the startup applications are .desktop files stored per-user in

63413
folder	directory
if a user toggles enable disable status of a given application without deleting it that was in the system folder it is copied to the user directory and then the attribute x-gnome-autostart-enabled is changed

63413
folder	directory
if a user deletes a given application from the list the .desktop is copied to user folder with the attribute or the file is simply deleted if it was present just in the user directory

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i m very familiar with ubuntu linux programming and packaging but i m not sure what the conceptual and technical differences are between an ubuntu app and a debian package

63447
ubuntu	linux
is there such a thing for ubuntu or linux in general

63476
ubuntu	debian
these packages are not compiled for ubuntu but for debian and it s likely that these were built against an older version of libxml2

63485
ubuntu	debian
i used to have debian and i had no problem with that but now i moved to ubuntu 11.04 and i cant control audio with hardware keys fn+f12

63490
kde	gnome
not sure about kde but with gnome you need to change the output device in sound preferences if you want the sound to go to the tv instead of the standard output

63494
put	get
i m not sure if it should be asked here or on forums but i ll still put it up here to get discussion started

63565
ubuntu	linux
i m running a dell xps l502x one of those hybrid graphics models that don t yet just work on linux when i installed ubuntu natty i just went ahead and accepted whatever options i was given including installing the current nvidia drivers

63566
versioning	upgrade
note that this approach is not very good you will not receive security updates to glade it doesn t look like a risky package and if some package depends on the new glade versioning it s not going to be upgrade installed

63579
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
to use it you need to do the following on the terminal you need to use sudo visudo and add this line at the end of the file so that no passwd is necessary to shutdown your computer using account

63594
nautilus	fstab
if i have an encrypted external disk or an internal disk that is not in fstab i see an entry for it in nautilus -- with an entry like x gb encrypted volume

xfce	gnome
i set up my gnome session to use tint2 as a window list panel but i don t need it when using xfce therefore i d like to have tint2 start only under classic ubuntu session

63646
firefox	safari
what is more baffling is that any lan side computer these are different flavours of operating systems ubuntu 10.04 mac snow leopard windows xp all work fine they can get to browse the internet using a range of browsers firefox v3.6.22 safari ie but here is the problem - the gateway computer can t browse the internet - this is the one that is running ubuntu 11.04 firefox 6.0.2

63650
filesystems	ntfs
it isn t a good idea to have your home folder on an ntfs partition since the ntfs filesystems lacks some features that have been around since the earliest installments of unix

63650
filesystems	ntfs
in rough detail every program that needs to create a unix-domain-socket a filesystems based fifo or pipe in your home folder will utterly fail on ntfs

63654
ati	nvidia
i prefer the nvidia s but i know that ati s are also good and many

63654
ati	nvidia
people prefer ati over nvidia and i have seen an ati radeon with 3 gb

installation	upgrade
so is it recommended to make a complete new installation from time to time rather than to upgrade continuously

xfce	gnome
i use gnome and xfce sessions but whereas in gnome i have application shortcuts on the panel in xfce i prefer having application launchers on the desktop

63813
gentoo	ubuntu
why isn t ubuntu as user friendly as gentoo in this aspect

ubuntu	linux
fonts-ubuntu-font-family-console ubuntu font family linux console fonts sans-serif monospace

64032
google-chrome	firefox
after i ve installed google-chrome not chromium i noticed that it completely overwrote any behaviour set for the default browser thus resulting in any link clicked in the gnome environment being opened in google-chrome instead of my actual default browser firefox

64043
versioning	upgrade
seamonkey was originally installed through synaptic i can t remember if the icon showed then but i don t believe it did. then later uninstalled so i could manually install a non-buggy versioning and has since been upgrade to the current 2.4.1

64044
filesystems	ntfs
when people talk about the filesystems names like ext4 ufs ntfs etc

64044
filesystems	xfs
this allows you to select the best type of filesystems ext4 ufs xfs etc. for individual directories depending on the nature of the stored information and security requirements

64046
kde	gnome
i don t know much about qt and gtk+ but i ve heard that qt is for kde and gtk+ is for gnome

64048
xfce	kde
they will work well with qt apps in unity kde lxde xfce etc

64050
ubuntu	debian
so if you want to have integration in to your ubuntu desktop you need to use the pre-compiled assembled packages deb files or installer files for ubuntu debian either by downloading them or using apt or you do everything by hand using source or compiled binaries for your system

if you want to use sudo without a passwd from a web page you should probably limit the commands that it can run

my opinion is that it s not canonical s decision alone because ubuntu is a product of canonical paid developers and community developers in addition to all the work done by the many upstreams including debian gnome and so on

to simply convert files from windows wav to flac on the commandline the official tool flac would be the obvious choice

i would expect all of today s motherboards to be either usb 2.0 or 3.0 but if it s a nas you bought that you re not making out of pc components the chances are pretty good that it s a 1.1 port just meant for attaching a keyboard and mouse

65042
ubuntu	linux	filesystems	ntfs
well first u have to figure out which primary partition windows resides on so boot into the ubuntu livecd if you can or boot into any other linux distro that supports windows drive mounting fat32 ntfs and mount the four detected partitions i believe ubuntu automatically does that for u there should be drive icons on ur desktop that says xgb filesystems double click on the icons and u ll mount the partitions and open them with nautilus then use nautilus or whatever your favourite file browser to locate the partition where u see all the windows system files windows system32 mark down that particular partition dev sdax or dev hdax then backup all your data or just stuff u wanna keep on the other partitions and then u can safely re-partition all the other drives except for the marked down windows drive you can delete all the other primary drives and create new extended partitions i suggest u do that in windows linux formatted extended drives sometimes don t get recognized in windows and a second primary partition for ubuntu and perhaps additional swap space

xfce	gnome
if you want something similar to and relatively compatible with gnome 2 then i suggest you try xfce

65087
kde	gnome
because it isn t a 3d desktop environment like unity gnome shell or kde and so it runs faster on older hardware

65089

kde is probably the second most well-known de available after gnome

65378

the difference is that mine never worked from day 1 on both gnome and kde

65424
kde	gnome
i am asking this because in kde was a very simple thing to change i remember i just changed something about modifier key and it all went back to normal without changing any configuration inside maya and i believe gnome has to have a similar option that i cannot find

the first thing i did was changing screens resolution with jupiter applet to too large so tv switching off and didn t show anything from netbook

65451
ubuntu	linux
if the linux kernel supports a particular wireless adapter then ubuntu will support that wireless adapter

65451
ubuntu	linux
the latest ubuntu will always have the latest linux kernel and therefore have the most up to date support for any kind of device

65451
ubuntu	linux
if a ubuntu developer were to produce a driver module for a certain device then that code would be passed upstream to the linux kernel developers for inclusion in the kernel and then come back down stream when the modified kernel is used by ubuntu

you need to do the following on the terminal type sudo visudo and add a line like this at the end of the file specifying the commands you want to run without typing the sudo passwd

65464

now you can run the specified commands without passwd as long as you type that command with sudo

65464

ie lets you want to run shutdown -r now without having to type sudo passwd everytime and your username is joedoe

since my system was laggy in gnome 3 i switched to xfce but now all the titlebar and menu fonts are blurry but the fonts in chromium seem normal

unity 3d becomes a black screens after pressing the dash-button or after pressing alt-tab to switching between open windows

66179

so it might be advisable to uninstall guest additions before the upgrade from 10.10 to 11.04 as the old versioning might prevent the upgrade system to boot properly into desktop

66181
xfce	gnome
the gnome global menu panel plugin for lucid via the xfapplet plugin not in the official repos anymore that can embed gnome plugins into the xfce panel - unfortunately the globalmenu doesn t show up in the xfapplet list of available gnome plugins there s only one item in it

i was assuming that you are using a filesystems that does not support unix file permissions such as fat32 and ntfs

66211
ati	nvidia
about what driver to use well any of those will have the same effects the choppiness comes from using compiz with 3d effects that s not well handled either by nvidia or ati drivers in most cases that is

my advise is to use the fglrx driver but instead of the unity3d desktop use the unity2d desktop as default

i was able to remap the tablet keys the buttons right below the screens to the unused keycodes 130 131 and 132

66649
screens	tablet
the only thing that keeps me from committing to the dell duo as a solid ubuntu tablet is that it would suck to have to use an applet to change the orientation of the screens

66657
kde	gnome
i can of course check if the environment is unity but some people use appmenu in kde or in classic gnome so i m looking for more universal way

said well but keep in mind those drivers the graphics driver not the catalyst software are older than the ones offered by ati amd so the best thing to do is to check their website search for ati drivers to see if your graphics card is supported for linux or not in that case the ubuntu developers have suggested to download them from the manufacturer s web site rather than the ones on repos however i lost my ui for some odd reason carries its own risks

this is important because as soon as you get people to work with linux you are gonna get a lot of questions about how it works or how to fix it do i hear you saying ubuntu is so easy to use you can just install and work with it like windows

73569
versioning	upgrade
if you are running one of these systems then chromium-browser was upgrade from the -proposed repository so you can prevent it from being updated further until the versioning 15 packages have underwent further testing and been released for general use by disabling that software source or better by using pinning as explained in enableproposed

it appears that the aptitude state is corrupt - note that apt-get and the other dpkg tools still work fine

73872
ubuntu	linux
on a modern ubuntu system and many other gnu linux distributions fixing a corrupted sudoers file is actually quite easy and doesn t require rebooting using a live cd or physical access to the machine

73872
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo
assuming you or some other user are authorized to run programs as root with policykit you can enter your passwd and then it will run visudo as root and you can fix your etc sudoers

73980
folder	directory
then you can just create symlinks in your home directory to the folder on the ntfs partition

73980
folder	directory
if you want to replace the built-in documents pictures directory i would advice to remove them in terminal because nautilus tracks any changes to those special folder when you change them via nautilus and adjusts its settings so renaming documents to documents.old and creating a new documents symlink via nautilus would not behave as you expect

although i have ubuntu 11.10 with mono jit compiler version 2.10.5 debian 2.10.5-1 output of mono --version this error seems to be trolling me

74083
sudo	passwd
after that you wont be prompted for a passwd to use sudo apt-get install anymore but please understand this is a very risky solution there is a reason why you need to type a passwd for some commands the use of these commands without passwd can leave your system open for some dangers

74110
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is a closed source microsoft filesystems and you ll need windows to repair it by running chkdsk f as suggested

xfs is packed full of cool features like guaranteed rate i o online resizing built-in quota enforcement and it can theoretically support filesystems up to 8 exabytes in size

74365
filesystems	btrfs
according to the lead developer btrfs aims to â œlet linux scale for the storage that will be available.â btrfs once completed and matured will likely be a strong contender in the linux filesystems world on both desktops and servers

74470
puts	gets
the only issue i have had is using a kde linux distro as a host since they dont account for plasma and as such it never puts the file where i want it but i figured out that the file gets transfered to a tmp folder and now i just have a link to that folder in my desktop widget

74470
temp	tmp
when files are dragged and dropped with a kubuntu host guest they go into a temp folder tmp vmwarednd so you could search there if they don t show up where you dragged them to

versioning	upgrade
if you installed the proprietary driver included with ubuntu or you do not want to upgrade to a newer versioning it may be possible to work around the issue by using a control file from a newer versioning of catalyst than the one you re running

74809
filesystems	fat
there are a lot of ways to do this more intelligent ways etc but the long story is that you can t get the behavior you want with chmod especially if the filesystems is a fat filesystems that has no native concept of permissions

74829
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	debian	centos
my only guess is that php is receiving stdin instead of less when you type commands into less but i m baffled as to why this behaviour is only seen in ubuntu i have confirmed that php --rc pdo | less works fine in sabayon centos and debian while breaking on several different ubuntu installs including those updated to 11.10

74851
filesystems	ntfs
contrary to what most people believe ntfs is a posix-compatibleâ¹ filesystems and it is possible to use permissions on ntfs

if you have a fat32 partition then you should either install using a downloaded desktop cd iso or use your ntfs partition as there is a size limit of 4gb on fat32 filesystems

74923

to shrink the filesystems by 4 gib btrfs filesystems resize -4g mnt or btrfsctl -r -4g mnt set the fs size

75132
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs filesystems resize -500m media alpha

75132
filesystems	btrfs
assuming the guidelines for resizing btrfs filesystems are the same as for other filesystems you should avoid resizing a partition that is on the same physical disk as the running system

75132
filesystems	btrfs
i am not personally very familiar with btrfs filesystems but it seems strange to me that these resize commands take the mount point of the filesystems rather than the device name

75147

4 unpack bin folder from archive to for example your home directory

the problem relates to ntfs partitions external drives but also include linux filesystems

75201
filesystems	ntfs
ubuntu supports ntfs windows filesystems by default and you don t need any special software to view them

also kde apps that i ve removed from the gnome menu still appear in the unity dash

75217
ethernet	wireless
i am trying to share my ubuntu 11.10 internet connection via my wireless to another computer via ethernet

75248
versioning	upgrade
if you cannot find your problem or fix it the problem might be that your hardware doesn t support the versioning of the ubuntu that you have try to upgrade it or just wait for ubuntu 12.04 long term support that is coming out in march 2012 and by then they will have fixed the problem

75281
kubuntu	gnome
is it installing kubuntu and then installing the appropriate gnome packages

75288
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
if you install kubuntu across all computers which i would suggest since it seems like you have decided that kde will be the default desktop environment users who want to run unity or gnome shell can run either of the following commands

i m on openbsd now so my ubuntu-specific knowledge might be a bit off but you can do what i did i m also a colemak convert for ubuntu

the latest drivers from synaptics made two-finger scolling possible with windos 7 so i m guessing there s some way to work in ubuntu linux

kvm vmware or virtualbox

75542
ubuntu	linux
so i went on the kodak site and talked to a representative online after googling and not finding anything helpful and all they told me was that kodak drivers do not support linux or any form of linux like ubuntu

75544
vmware	virtualbox
first of all using virtualbox or vmware depends on your needs

75544
vmware	virtualbox
for those you listed either virtualbox or vmware can do any of it easily

75544
vmware	virtualbox
choosing virtualbox or vmware is up to you

75544
vmware	virtualbox
you can use vmware server for free virtualbox is totally free as you can see

75545
ubuntu	linux
as you ve said kodak don t currently distribute linux drivers for their machines but the internet is a vast place and thanks to the amount of more advanced users using ubuntu their are some available

75559
ubuntu	linux
that means that the host computer will not really mather as long as it can support usb or esata and those are present in any recent motherboard and supported by linux thus support by ubuntu

75560
daemons	systemd
background daemons are started with invoke-rc.d which makes sure that the daemons is not started if its rc script says it is not supposed to run in the current systemd runlevel

75568
atom-editor	gedit
but in my asus 1215n with 2gb of ram and an atom-editor dual core 1.8ghz the msi wind u100 is an atom-editor single core 1.6ghz ubuntu is barely unusable nautilus update manager chrome eclipse and others take ages to start and if i have 2 applications open like terminal and gedit i am not kidding it becames so slow that i can t used it correctly

75568
ubuntu	linux
and arch linux with gnome3 or kde4 works better on my asus 1215n that ubuntu

i haven t seen this problem before it arrived after the upgrade from beta 2 to release versioning of ubuntu 11.10

i had to consult at least 3-4 guides for 11.04 and at least 5 different stack overflow post to get the thing running it seems like a very traumatic user experience to me

75922
vim	emacs
there is no mandatory development environment though many kde developers also use vim emacs or xemacs for example

75995
dpkg	aptitude
in 11.10 the nv video driver xserver-xorg-video-nv package has been removed from the distro by debian for lack of support from its authors though it still can be manually installed with dpkg aptitude and does actually still work otherwise just about fine

76011
ubuntu	debian
you should consider using the debian ubuntu way of building from source as this ensures that all files goes to the intended directories

76075
ubuntu	debian
as in debian we can use apt-pinning for version and installation control in ubuntu too

76098
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
there s also gnome 3 with the gnome shell instead of unity install the package gnome-shell and select gnome and kde 4 plasma install the package kubuntu-desktop and select kubuntu but those unlikely to be less resource-intensive than the above options

if you restore a user s home directory without the .gvfs folder it will be re-created and repopulated as needed

78340
folder	directory
in fact the proposed solution in bug 225361 was to put users .gvfs folder somewhere besides in their home directory like in tmp so they would automatically be skipped over by any operation targeting just the contents of users home directory

78340
folder	directory
the former would exclude folder called gvfs instead of .gvfs in users home directory

78340
folder	directory
and the latter assuming you mean it literally would exclude folder called .gvfs in the directory called .

78355
google-chrome	firefox
i changed it so that dns came after files and after rebooting the difference was night and day - dns lookups are much faster and websites load immediately instead of being stuck at sending request... in google-chrome or doing nothing in firefox

the free software foundation is an advocacy and activist organization for free software funds and otherwise supports the gnu project which develops a significant fraction of the software that goes into gnu linux distributions such as ubuntu and is the organizational author of many of the most popular free software licenses including the gnu general public license

79316
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
another useful and important source about what does and does not constitute free software is the debian free software guidelines from the debian project the gnu linux distribution from which ubuntu is derived see also this article

79316
ubuntu	linux
while these and other factors render ubuntu and most other highly popular gnu linux distributions not completely free and arguably there are distributions that are more thoroughly free ubuntu and its community have brought free software--and support for it--to thousands if not millions of people who would otherwise likely never have used it and has contributed positively to the spread of free software around the world and to people s ability to use free software in their own language

opera	firefox
i ve asked before and i ll ask again here and now how is it that firefox can get it right in windows and opera can get it right under linux but firefox can t get it right under linux

79928
ubuntu	debian
right now i am doing all of these things manually which for most part simply means updating the version number in debian changelog and reuploading them which sounds easy enough however when having to do that for a dozen packages across numerous versions of ubuntu things can get a little tiresome and error prone

caching data is ram is supposed to make things faster not slower - fetching things repeatedly from disk when you have unused memory is just silly

80237

you should be able to bind the screensaver lock command to ctrl + alt + l by editing your lubuntu keyboard mouse configuration file

80243

from my experience most of the time when you connect a remote via usb bluetooth adapter in ubuntu 10.04 and up they will behave basically like a mouse

80463
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu or any linux distro for that matter requires at least two partitions to run

80463
ubuntu	linux
as you have said that you are a new user i would recommend that you just simply delete the partition that you have reserved for linux using windows and then while installing ubuntu select to use all available free space for linux

in addition to being able to upgrade from one versioning to the next you can also upgrade from lts to the next lts such as from 10.04 to 12.04 and from 12.04 to 14.04 eventually

if you re new to ubuntu or linux i would suggest getting lubuntu because mini+lxde leaves you with fully functional system but at some points it s hard to configure

if you gnome kde programs even under lxde they will be slow anyways

i started by using the upgrade button in the upgrade app but found that the new versioning was unstable - firefox would crash every few minutes i would be logged out very suddenly for no known reason and so i decided to do a clean format and install believing that this may fix the problem

ubuntu	debian
the debian ubuntu packages in contrast have the variable data in var lib tomcat catalina_home the static java libraries in usr share tomcat tomcat_home the jni s in usr lib tomcat and use symlinks to tie it all together

80993
ubuntu	debian
this is because the debian package is designed to have a single tomcat installation be able to serve multiple running tomcat instances and because the packaging requirements are much more strict for debian ubuntu and actually insist that configuration is in etc variable data is in var and so on

80993

if you look at the debian ubuntu packages for libjboss- you ll see that all the libraries are separate packages

81283
mouse	keyboard
once ubuntu loads and i am at the log in screen then the keyboard and mouse work perfectly normally thereafter

81286
folder	directory
the point is i and we want the browser -- here we are talking about chrome -- to use the same folder directory as downloads and uploads location

81286

that is if i download a file it should go to the xxx directory and when i browse to upload a file the browser should directly take me to that folder xxx instead of the default folder like pictures downloads etc

in your particular case i see for example that linux-headers is a virtual package that is provided by both linux-headers-3.0.0-12 and linux-headers-3.0.0-13 and that sounds like the kind of package installation and removal handled by dist-upgrade but not by upgrade

81602
disk	ram
i was thinking maybe it s because of the disk reads which the torrent client performs are cached and fill up ram eventually

81665
versioning	upgrade
the second best bet is to upgrade to a newer release and you should do so as often as possible when a lts versioning is released in my opinion

81670
disk	ram
you could also adjust the swapiness and vm caching attributes to tell linux to hold onto more ram thus flushing to disk less

this is to create a isolated environment to build debian ubuntu packages

dpkg	apt
however if you do wish to attempt this technique you will have to manually download the .deb files for dpkg and apt

81838
dpkg	apt
you can find them at the dpkg in ubuntu and apt in ubuntu pages on launchpad--expand the latest version under the oneiric ocelot that is marked as release security and or updates but you probably don t want a version marked only proposed and or backports if there ever is one

81838
dpkg	apt
specifically the files you ll want are this one for dpkg and the others listed too if you have those packages installed and this and this and this and this and this for apt

you can install all these packages by putting them in a folder that contains nothing else suppose the folder is called debs and is inside your downloads directory and then running this command

81838
dpkg	apt
there are various ways of attempting to install a 64-bit kernel onto a 32-bit system but they are all extremely complicated so instead i recommend that you boot from a 64-bit oneiric live cd which itself runs a 64-bit kernel chroot into the installed ubuntu system and use the recently installed 64-bit apt and dpkg to install a 64-bit kernel

81838
dpkg	apt
if you haven t installed the .deb files for the 64-bit versions of dpkg and apt so do now

81838
dpkg	apt
with the 64-bit versions of dpkg and apt installed assuming that they will automatically install 64-bit packages you can now remove all your 32-bit kernels and install a 64-bit kernel

for some of them you might be informed you need them when attempting to install the 64-bit version of dpkg and or apt

versioning	upgrade
after an upgrade to 11.10 kernel linux lucid 3.0.0-13-generic #22-ubuntu which probably also updated skype to 2.2.35 not sure because i never checked the versioning before the sound that comes back from an echo test is very high pitched and squeaky

82406

ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is an operating system a linux distribution

82588
daemons	systemd
a operating systemd consists of several software components such as a kernel libraries services daemons applications etc

82588
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu uses the linux kernel which makes use of symmetric multiprocessing smp and multiple cores

82590
xfce	gnome
the problem i have is that neither pick up the gtk theme the way they usually do in gnome xfce

82599
ubuntu	linux
the same goes with linux kernel and the ubuntu distro if an application is build for a single thread then there is nothing more cpus will do

82602
versioning	upgrade
if you have upgrade from an earlier versioning of ubuntu you can try to boot an older kernel while booting by holding shift to show the grub menu

82608
kde	kubuntu
here with the kubuntu 11.10 kde 4.7.2 the okular packages installed

82631
init.d	pid
if nrpe has not exited by that time the pid file will still exist and the etc init.d nagios-nrpe-server script will remove it

82631
init.d	pid
worse if etc init.d nagios-nrpe-server restart is used not only will the pid file be removed the attempt to restart nrpe will fail provided that the nrpe daemon is still tardy in shutting down

82633
stdout	stderr
if you want to execute your application and get red color for error messages then print them to stderr instead of stdout

82704
daemon	cron
a well-behaved daemon that waits 5 minutes or a cron that runs a script that just stops when done

82707
daemon	cron
if you have something that needs to run every 5 minutes you should schedule it with cron and avoid all the daemon complexities

82710
pop-up	dialog
the default must run something - for example you could use this to display a quick pop-up dialog reminding you to right click

82722
toolbar	tabs
additionally in view - toolbar unmark menu bar and mark tabs on top

82727
kate	kde
in either case i use two kde apps a lot - kile and kate

82772
x86	64bit
a ppc mac will of course not run the windows 8 developer preview which is only available for 32-bit and 64bit x86 architectures. but that s not an ubuntu question--you may want to post about that at a mac support forum like this one or since you re trying to boot windows 8 a windows support forum like this one

82772
filesystems	ntfs
however this is probably not ok for the windows 8 developer preview and subsequent pre-releases and releases of windows 8 as they may use a version of ntfs different from the latest version supported by gparted or perhaps the new protogon filesystems

82844
debian	linux
at this time this manual page documents only the packaging system used by the debian gnu linux

82852
ati	nvidia
you are using open-source drivers which depending on the graphics card sometimes can be much slower in terms of frame-rate than their proprietary cousins ati nvidia

82892
ubuntu	linux
actually you get better sound experience in linux ubuntu than the windows7 s

82917
versioning	upgrade
i have been running 64 bit versioning of 11.10 which was upgrade from 11.04 and wasn t a fresh install

82964
rar	zip
if they can not be open is there a way to create rar and zip files that can be open on linux and windows operating systems

82965
gedit	nano
if you prefer not to use the nano editor and prefer the gnome text editor instead of sudo nano -b use gksu gedit

82965
gedit	nano
thus type in gksu gedit etc default grub instead of sudo nano -b etc default grub

82968
xfce	kde
well i had installed ubuntu then installed all the desktop environments like gnome-shell xfce and kde and everything works fine

82968
kde	gnome
but still there is lot of fine tuning which i had to do with each desktop environment installed especially with kde since gnome applications look awkward in the first instance while using them in kde

82976
pop-up	dialog	kde	gnome
how can i get ssh to behave under kde the same as it does on gnome - the first time the pass-phrase is needed pop-up a graphical dialog and store the pass-phrase in the agent

82981
kde	gnome
i don t know the internals so to explain why in gnome it works and in kde it doesn t but i can suggest a solution

83003
versioning	upgrade
running these commands will upgrade all such software to the latest versioning provided in your configured software sources

83003
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
to upgrade it to a later versioning simply download the newest .deb file or whatever versioning you want to upgrade to and follow those same installation instructions with the new .deb file

83003
versioning	upgrade
since subsonic is not automatically upgrade with the rest of the software on your system via apt-get you ll have to take care to remain current on issues that affect it so that you know when security vulnerabilities are discovered and when they are patched when a new versioning is released to fix the vulnerability

83036
versioning	upgrade
otherwise it s quite possible you can upgrade libdvdnav4 libdvdread4 to newer versioning there are no real dependency issues

83036
folder	dir
then go to these pages pick your arch right click on the top listed mirror save link as save into dvd_fix folder it s in your home dir

83049
sudo	passwd
you can install it by opening a terminal and typing sudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer enter then enter your passwd if askedâ

83054
ubuntu	linux
peazip is both available for windows and linux so any files that you create with peazip in ubuntu can be used in windows

83058

to render my system useable after upgrading to 11.10 i had to abandon gnome and install the kde window manager

83061

ubuntu with linux 2.6.35-generic recovery mode

83306
ubuntu	debian
if there is free open source software that you want made available in ubuntu s official software sources which is the primary way in which software can be made available to be installed in the software center you can file a needs-packaging request either upstream for debian which is often preferable as then it gets into debian and ubuntu or specifically for ubuntu

83306
ubuntu	debian
while upstream authors can package their software for inclusion in ubuntu and other operating systems much of the software available in ubuntu and other oses is packaged by others and if you file a needs-packaging request and the work is done it will likely be done by a contributor to debian and or ubuntu other than the program s original upstream author

83306
ubuntu	debian
as an alternative to officially packaging the software for debian or ubuntu you or the upstream developers or anybody at all can create a ppa for any free open source software

83308
dpkg	aptitude
it also includes command-line package management utilities like apt-get dpkg and aptitude

83343
installation	upgrade
for these reasons it would not make sense for it to be installed by default during a fresh installation or upgrade and it is not

83361
kde	kubuntu
the kde 4 or kde 4 plasma or kde 4 plasma workspaces or just kde interface is provided by the kubuntu session type

83377

83544
versioning	upgrade
if you want to upgrade from one versioning to another you should follow the instructions provided by the ubuntu developers

83559

wma	asf	wmv	asf
asf is a container for wma wmv and mpeg4 file formats and vlc helps in encoding and decoding this so that the file plays seamlessly on your system

83943
versioning	upgrade
my question is whether doing the upgrade for that many versioning contributes to the bugs that i see

83951
ati	nvidia
considering the only two good brands on the market ati and nvidia i suggest ati over nvidia without a doubt

83972
debian-based	linux

with those two out of the way to give an idea not an actual estimation you have several sites that did some work most of which only compare linux not only ubuntu

84097
ubuntu	debian
i actually am surprised not to see in the graph venezuela even though the government promotes a self-made derivative of debian canaima you can bet there are more users that like ubuntu and have it installed

84097
ubuntu	mint
add to that that ubuntu s little son is growing up am talking about mint and people start looking somewhere else although in my opinion there is not much to look at in terms of performance of ease of use taking aside the default stuff that gets installed

84097
ubuntu	linux
lastly a great idea for ubuntu and to track how the progress of ubuntu users is going is to add when installing ubuntu an option to send similar to linux counter some info about the pc and version of ubuntu used

84103
ubuntu	linux
when you install from the cd dvd by logical and previously you should have a free hard drive space or a unpartitioned space for installing ubuntu and also have windows os installed first the problem is that when you install the grub grub2 ubuntu or linux boot loader it delete the windows mbr master boot record

yes btrfs is cow copy-on-write which would imply it fragments files much more than ext but this is addressed in several aspects of the design including the ability to easily defrag the filesystems while it is online

btrfs already offers alternatives to fight this problem first it supports online defragmentation using the command btrfs filesystems defragment

85125
uninstall	upgrade
the solution then is to uninstall the proprietary drivers before you reboot after a kernel upgrade and then reinstall them

85138
vmware	virtualbox
this virtual device is mapped to the real physical device by the virtualisation tool - virtualbox vmware xen etc

85138
ati	nvidia
bumblebee ironhide is an either or graphics switching mechanism - you are using either integrated graphics or the higher capacity nvidia ati graphics but not both at the same time

85144
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m trying to learn python and i want to write gui apps for linux primarily ubuntu and mint since they are the distros i have access to and they seem to be the most popular

85146
automake	autotools
if i m not using autoconf automake does my makefile need to be set up in a particular way or are the autotools required

85148
filesystems	btrfs
i ve install ubuntu 11.10 with btrfs as the filesystems was a bit of a mess to do i ll explain if people are interested so i can expand the primary filesystems into the second drive on the system

85148
filesystems	btrfs
after installing the system i ran btrfs device add dev sdb1 and it added the new device and expanded the filesystems on to it and all was good

85148
filesystems	btrfs
but according to the wrong manual i was reading i also had to run btrfs filesystems balance and this apparently converted my filesystems to raid1 mode so everything is stored redundantly twice - once on each drive and i can only use 50 of my total capacity

85148
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
like can be done with lvm but with btrfs you can host multiple partitions on the same filesystems and space is allocated dynamically where you need it - unlike in lvm

85149
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux and ubuntu

85161
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
happens with unity gnome xfce and kde

85164
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
gtk is used as the standard toolkit for the gnome lxde and xfce desktop environments while qt is used for kde

85169
width	height
just make sure the images you will use are not bigger width x height than the originals

85201
folder	directory
using the configuration folder in you home directory doesn t require root permissions and if you mess things up the worst that can happen is that you would need to create a new user account

85233
folder	directory
i copied a set of bluej files from usr share doc bluej to a bluej directory however the files in folder are set to root permission and read only i need to be able to read write them

85237
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r username.username bluej

85238
folder	directory
simply it will create a directory in your home folder called .wamaker and will use it to store the icon files of the urls then will create a .desktop files launchers and place them on your desktop

85244
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
i m posting it because i do not know of any other solution that allows backing up a running server including system files other than lvm btrfs zfs other cow filesystems and things that are generally not available on a vps -- and r1soft s linux hot copy

85259
folder	directory
the best way to go about this is to copy your scripts brushes and fonts to the gimp folder in your home directory where only you can use them

85259
folder	directory
to add them to your home directory open your home folder it looks like this in the launcher

85271
ubuntu	debian
use a package from ubuntu or build a source package from debian or anything else

85291
opensuse	linux	opensuse	mint	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	mint
i have the same notebook and had the same problem after i installed peppermint mint ubuntu 11.10 ubuntu 11.04 opensuse and some other linux distros

85318
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux ubuntu

85348
installation	upgrade
if the installation is upgrade it affects the installed packages regardless of whether the installation is a server or a desktop

85362
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
44bsd used in freebsd netbsd openbsd

85362
solaris	sunos
sun used in sunos solaris

85377
ubuntu	linux
i m a big fan of mac os but honestly with the development and growth of linux especially ubuntu mac os is becoming a useless luxury

85381
ubuntu	linux
i ve installed ubuntu 10.04 on an usb drive a few days ago and have been mostly using linux since them but i ve been able to start windows properly after using the pen drive linux

85412
ubuntu	debian
there is nothing in debian or ubuntu that directly compares to yast

85424
put	get
the only specific change for you jail.local would be at action line where you need to put the application concerned for the protection and what you want to get as result

85436
ethernet	wireless
i have created a user with connect to wireless and ethernet networks unchecked but the user can still access internet wireless

85530
google-chrome	firefox
if you go to gnome extensions using firefox google-chrome epiphany and other webkit based browsers do not work yet and look for the alternative status menu extension

85561
ubuntu	linux
start from a ubuntu installation cd or any other linux that runs from cd like knoppix

85570
ubuntu	opensuse
a in my opinion opensuse isn t quite as user friendly as ubuntu but i ve spent much more time with the latter than the former

85570
ubuntu	opensuse
compared with ubuntu 11.10 however opensuse is probably a little more like other distros than ubuntu which might result in less wasted efort should you hop top another distro

85572
ubuntu	linux
indeed ubuntu has all the desktops that all other gnu linux distros provide

85580
switching	screens
but then it hangs with a black screens and the monitors switching off saying no signal

85585
ubuntu	linux
for a new user of linux ubuntu is the most user friendly distro for you

85585
ubuntu	linux
however linux is about choice and in fact if you choose ubuntu you have a lot of desktop environments to choose from which can change the feel of your ubuntu desktop gaining customization and maintaining the benefits of ubuntu

85585
kde	kubuntu
and then if you like kde you can full install kubuntu distro instead

85585
xfce	kde
kde and xfce are mainly customizable per se

85609
switching	screens
you will be presented with the option of having lightdm as your default login screens or being able to switching between the two it is your choice

85680
pygtk	pygobject
also i see that pygtk is being phased out and replaced with pygobject is pygtk still relevant

85682
width	height
so if your opening page is index.html web browsers look for that name as standard and the image is in the same folder then the brower will load picture.jpg with the width and height set for it

85705
xfce	gnome
how do i stop my laptop from suspending when closing the lid under lightdm - the power management settings in xfce or gnome 3 does not seem to apply when the window manager is not running

85723
ubuntu	linux
i refer to those anytime i need to learn something new about shell scripting in ubuntu linux

85761
youtube	vimeo
if videos show correctly in places like youtube vimeo espn and others and not in foxsoccer this is an issued with that site and not firefox or ubuntu 11.10

85762
sudo	passwd
in order to use sudo you have to both use your login passwd and be in the admin group

85810
ubuntu	debian
at first i thought to add debian stable repository and install better tested version but it turned out that perhaps that s not very good idea - adding debian repository in ubuntu

85836
unity2d	unity3d
as to why you possibly are using unity2d without knowing it - this is likely to be due to your graphics card and or drivers - i ve linked to a question below how you can determine if you have unity3d support

85844
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu 10.10 and my linux skills are somewhat rusty

85845
put	get
i advice you to adjust boot priority and put cd or usbhdd at top of the list and then reboot probably boot priority won t get saved due to buggy bios see below

85903
sudoers	passwd
you will then need to manually edit mnt etc passwd and mnt etc group and mnt etc sudoers

85936
google-chrome	firefox
it s quite similar to the trade-offs between firefox and google-chrome

85936
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ui is written in xul an extension of javascript and google-chrome in c++

85939
truecrypt	umount
the simulation is takes around 2-3 days and i would like to umount the truecrypt but i can t because i the matlab had opened the files and i forgot to include the close function to close those files

85939
truecrypt	umount
i don t want to stop the simulation but i would like to umount the truecrypt

85979
dlsym	dlopen
please note we are not talking about advanced tricks here like explicit loading of dso s using the dlopen dlsym api

85983
stdout	stderr
in your case this should work as well since you re expecting output on stdout stderr

85989
udp	tcp
shairplay doesn t support tcp and raop_play i think pulseaudio-module-raop is based on this doesn t support udp

85989
udp	tcp
why raop is tcp only is weird udp seems like an easier and more suited protocol on the face of it

85989
mp3	flac
and if you re source is flac then icecast via mp3 is going to kill quality plus it s more of a cpu hog

85998
switching	screens
if you are left with a blank screens use ctrl + alt + f2 to log into a tty and use this q a to switching back to lightdm

86016
folder	directory
should i use folder within my home directory

86046
sudo	passwd
if you must you can configure sudo so that a passwd is not required but understand the security implications if you choose to do so

86054
ubuntu	debian
possible also ubuntu or debian specific patches

86068
ubuntu	linux
in my limited experience when putty works but linux ubuntu in this case does not it is usually keep alive

86071
pop-up	dialog
however many app pop-up dialog including ubuntu s display settings show up on that secondary monitor

86086
filesystems	ntfs
and it s odd that all ntfs filesystems are affected

86088
filesystems	ntfs
keep in mind that this utility came from a reverse engineering process and are not the best option to manage your filesystems the ntfs filesystems does not belong to the gnu linux world

86093
nautilus	fstab
also you can set the permissions in etc fstab that in addition to the noauto option should allow to mount with nautilus with option determined in fstab

86118
ubuntu	linux
the default grub entries are ubuntu with linux 2.6.35-31-generic and .. recovery mode - the couple that does not boot up

86118
ubuntu	linux
but when i choose ubuntu with linux 2.6.35-30-generic from the list everything works fine

86144
sudo	passwd
you could make your sudo work without a passwd

86150
versioning	upgrade
since the 11.10 versioning of ubuntu is no lts i was wondering if her system will be fine after an upgrade to 12.04 lts or if it will be broken

86150
versioning	upgrade
of course since 12.04 hasnt been released yet you cant really tell but mabye you have experiences from previous versioning upgrade

86158
iscsi	smb
it could be as simple as using nfs or smb to share a directory of isos or using iscsi to forward a single iso image

86163
mouseup	mousedown
when switching into uncontinous view mode i cannot switch to previous page mouseup nor to next page mousedown

86183
cpu	processors
processors intelâ coreâ 2 duo cpu t6400 2.00ghz ã 2

86184
filesystems	ntfs
twice in two weeks the filesystems table has become corrupted on a ntfs partition

86217
portrait	landscape
since i upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 my login screen reverted back to landscape mode and only goes to portrait mode what i want once i login

86229
versioning	upgrade
and that is all the versioning currently installed at the time of the lock will stay installed even during upgrade

86232
ubuntu	linux
the question is not if ubuntu supports your hardware or not it is more if your hardware builder has made any drivers for your hardware to be usable in linux

86236
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way for me to sync bookmarks between firefox and google-chrome on several different ubuntu machines

86239
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome synchronizes with the google servers firefox with the firefox servers or your own server but i ve never tried it .

86239
google-chrome	firefox
you can sync firefox with ubuntu one but then again it won t affect google-chrome

86243
ubuntu	linux
i have to say i do not believe that the open-source driver s performance will ever be as good as the closed driver but talking about ubuntu and linux we want to have at least the alternative to have our hardware running under minimum conditions with a open source driver

86263
google-chrome	firefox
there are plugins both for google-chrome and firefox

86265
google-chrome	firefox
if you only need to sync between firefox and google-chrome you can use google bookmarks and the gmarks add-on for firefox

86265
google-chrome	firefox
just put your current bookmarks in google-chrome into google bookmarks and then when using firefox install the gmarks add-on

86275
gentoo	ubuntu
those links will have gentoo and arch specific information which you can ignore as you are on ubuntu

86278
folder	directory
is there a hidden folder in my home directory or something

86289
ubuntu	debian
i have tried with debian testing and i have the same problem it was alright on older ubuntu and with debian squeeze

86296
sudo	passwd
that s all one line and when prompted with sudo passwd type in your own passwd

86302
filesystems	ntfs
based on the mount output it looks like your second hard drive is formatted with the ntfs filesystems

86327
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems ntfs

86327
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems ntfs

86327
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems ntfs

86333
google-chrome	firefox
for example i want to use f5 key to switch to google-chrome and f6 key to firefox etc

86373
folder	directory
it contains the folder viewing settings for a directory in kde

86382
switching	screens
switching between applications with alt + tab works properly but it does not like the screens shots on the ubuntu website

86412
kde	gnome
when using the fontsize slider of gnome-tweak or ubuntu-tweak to 1.6 multiplier within gnome 3.2 suddenly when logging into kde 4.7 the fonts of native kde applications like dolphin get messed up

86412
kde	gnome
how can i prevent kde from loading the gnome fontsize settings and solve this issue

86432
kde	gnome
i used to have kde and gnome installed together untill i started to get similar problems

86438
move	drag
this is not an answer to the main part of your question which appears to be a bug but to move windows when the window decorators can t be reached you can keep alt pressed and then drag the window around

86456
mouse	keyboard
i left my computer for a while and came back shook the mouse and when it goes to the login screen to resume the onboard keyboard is there and i can t close it

86456
post	get
if you need screenshots i ll post some when i get home

86457
kde	gnome
if you are not familiar with ubuntu yet you can always go with gnome or kde but that is sort of overkill and installs unnecessary packages

86457
kde	gnome
unlike a desktop such as gnome or kde they are targeted at the activities you will do with a server

86465
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu 11.10 3.0.0-13-generic #22-ubuntu smp and help is very much appreciated as i have no clue what i could do beginner in linux

86466
implements	extends
i followed pattern from default ubuntu app where preferences and about dialog are implements extends gtk.dialog so i added new dialog with similar code 2 classes

86478
mouse	keyboard
s keyboard and mouse shortcuts

86515
sudo	passwd
let www-data run some commands without a passwd for sudo

86521
vmware	virtualbox
if you are installing winxp inside virtualbox or vmware for ubuntu it is really no brainer

86554
mouse	keyboard
everything on the display freezes stops responding including the mouse and keyboard

86583
ubuntu	linux
what is the best practice to setup the classpath in ubuntu and linux in general

86599
put	get
note that you can put it in etc ssh known_hosts so that all users get it not just your current user

86618
ubuntu	linux
i know that there is a way in which one can install linux or ubuntu on windows easily but what about installing windows on linux or ubuntu i.e if i have a machine with only ubuntu how can i install windows on it without removing ubuntu

86710
sudo	passwd
choose ubuntu on the hd open the terminal and type sudo update-grub enter your passwd

86713
filesystems	fat
if you want to allow custom permissions you might want to either reformat the flash drive using a filesystems other than fat ext3

86757
hash	md5
how to get the md5 hash of a string directly in the terminal

86762
ubuntu	linux
i am new to ubuntu and unix linux so i know very little about getting it to do much at the command-line level

86766
sudo	passwd
and then to specify the passwd for the just created used type sudo passwd ftpuser and type the desired passwd 2 times

86776
bazaar	cvs	bazaar	git	bazaar	svn	cvs	svn
i had nautilus-integrators for svn git bazaar mercurial cvs

86791
vmware	virtualbox
you could then use vmware on windows free or run the resultant .vmdk as a virtualbox harddisk

86796
debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian
or is the debian package listed on the shorewall website compatible with ubuntu 11.10 since ubuntu is debian-based

86815
debian-based	ubuntu
for ubuntu and other debian-based operating systems this is usr lib cgi-bin while html and other content is stored in var www

86822
folder	directory
i am trying to copy the contents of a folder to another folder in a different directory using terminal

86824
folder	directory
cp is the command to copy using a terminal -r makes it recursively so current directory + further directory inside current folder1 is the origin folder new_folder1 is the destination folder for the files folder inside the origin

86869
google-chrome	firefox	vim	emacs
vim emacs screen and zsh all have the ability to enter these however i am unsure how to do it in other gui programs firefox google-chrome

86877
rss	feed
i have created an rss feed lens based on unity-lens-python but i cannot get the filters to work

86930
sudo	passwd
login as administrator by using comand sudo -s and enter your passwd and then try again

86942
versioning	upgrade
when the user has not even done an update for a while so now he she has the updates for that versioning of ubuntu and also the distribution upgrade pending

86942
versioning	upgrade
the user is up to date with all the updates for that particular versioning of ubuntu and only needs to upgrade to the new distribution versioning

86942
versioning	upgrade
but what would happened or if it possible to upgrade to the latest distribution without first updating the packages for the versioning of ubuntu used in that case

86968
filesystems	ntfs
the disadvantage of the second method is ubuntu is not going to debug a ntfs partition if there is a problem with the filesystems

86981
ubuntu	linux
if you want support from the linux ubuntu community use grub

86993
versioning	upgrade
some of them keep a versioning for 3 releases then have to do multiple upgrade at the same time

86997
ati	nvidia
in this case it works on nvidia ati and intel cards

87009
google-chrome	firefox
in vga or hdmi my text looks blurry while browsing with firefox google-chrome using nautilus etc..

87039
kde	gnome
you can un-do that command if needed you might break gksu or running applications as root under gnome or other de may not be an issue if you only run kde

87042
ubuntu	mint
caution - mixing the ubuntu and mint repos can cause serious problems

87047
post	get
that should get you started post back if you get stuck

87061
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu s terminal uses case-sensitive auto-completion as i suppose would be expected for linux

87096
ubuntu	debian
although i m on a debian distro this should work for ubuntu as well re install gvfs-backends log out and in and you should be fine

87143
google-chrome	firefox
in windows by default those side buttons work as the back and forward buttons in apps like firefox google-chrome explorer etc

87153
g++	gcc
so just install the default package gcc or g++ and it will also install gcc 4.5 or g++ 4.5 respectively

87153
g++	gcc
should work if you really just want gcc as opposed to g++ for example

87195
ubuntu	linux
there is ndn - necromancer dos navigator which is dn fork and is available also for linux developed tested linux version on ubuntu 8 or ubuntu 6 iirc

87212
google-chrome	firefox
it seems like the hard drive is working overtime even with the simplest of programs text editor firefox or google-chrome with one or two tabs open tomboy notes etc

87222
unity2d	unity3d
it happens only when using unity3d unity2d should not have this issue

87229
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
lxde is faster than gnome kde xfce

87241
filesystems	btrfs
as a test i want to install ubuntu 11.10 onto a btrfs filesystems in raid10 mode

87262
folder	directory
so your home directory contains home folder for adminuser usera and userb

87295
folder	directory
the .fonts folder in your home directory

87306
installation	upgrade
the ppa purplekarrot by daniel pfeiffer does not upgrade my current 1.42 installation

87315
ubuntu	debian
both are tested on several other computers with ubuntu debian or even with xp and they re mounted without any problems and formatted on fat32 and they re working on this computer before on earlier ubuntu versions

87315
ubuntu	linux
i ve tried to solve this problem in many ways founded on many linux or ubuntu forums but it seams that my system is something different

87361
mouse	keyboard
it loaded the login screen and just like the live cd and live usb then decided to freeze and not respond to anything i do with the keyboard or mouse

87390
uninstall	upgrade
i had other problems though related to the upgrade from 11.04 so i ended up reinstalling from clean so i m not totally sure if how the uninstall works

87414
kubuntu	gnome
sudo stop lightdm or kdm or gdm instead of lightdm if you installed kubuntu or gnome shell

87414
kubuntu	gnome
sudo start lightdm or kdm or gdm instead of lightdm if you installed kubuntu or gnome shell

87426
mouse	keyboard
the mouse and monitor switch fine but the separate keyboard does not work when the kvm switches to the netbook

87426
mouse	keyboard
this model of kvm runs the keyboard and mouse through a single usb i suspect this is what is confusing the eee pc

87442
ati	nvidia
i had problems with a pc with one ati and one nvidia graphics card for 4 screens

87493
ubuntu	linux
im new to linux and just installed ubuntu 11.10

87506
versioning	upgrade
because this libraries are marked as upgrade for your system they have upgrade some parts of your ubuntu like the new appearance settings which is available for the new versioning 11.10 of ubuntu

87509
pop-up	dialog
sometimes people try to do things with this account that require elevated privileges - this causes gnome s please enter an administrative user s password dialog to pop-up

87509
sudo	passwd
however this dialog requests my passwd - when i set up the machine mine was the first account created so it seems to be assuming that i am the only user granted sudo powers

87509
sudoers	passwd
dave is actually an account that many people use who can t be in etc sudoers because its passwd is public knowledge

87543
sudo	passwd
given all this both sudo and policykit are much more complicated with respect to the configurations that can be achieved you can configure action that can be executed without passwd executed only by a particular user or group etc

87556
pygtk	pygobject
if you need to convert an old pygtk app to pygi you should try the pygi-convert script that comes with the pygobject tarball

87560
google-chrome	firefox
it s in the google-chrome store or you can just go to tweetdeck.com in firefox

87567
ubuntu	debian
if you want mate without the minty-freshness sic you could use the debian repo specifically for ubuntu

87567
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
what this means is that - unlike the linux mint derivative - the mate-desktop in this repo will sit much more comfortably along side any other desktops installed on ubuntu - for example gnome-shell unity lxde etc

87567
versioning	upgrade
the linux mint mate repo contains mint specific changes but more importantly later versioning of the gnome-3 packages that will upgrade unity gnome-shell packages - it is a more one way install

87569
ubuntu	mint
first of all install mgse mint gnome shell extension in ubuntu 11.10 by entering this command in terminal

87569
ubuntu	mint
now search and install mint gnome shell extension followed by mint meta mate from the ubuntu software center

87579
versioning	upgrade
so what i ve been slowly doing is going back to 11.04 and avoiding the versioning upgrade

87598
xfce	gnome
gnome shell xfce ldxe etc

87677
folder	dir
i created some links to folder in my home dir so i don t have to go down the long path all the time i used ln -s for this

87701
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	debian
i ve tried some upstream git sources to apply newer pam auth but it didn t make any sense because of its target would be always fedora redhat platform so ubuntu debian might be needed some more patchworks.

87707
mp3	ogg
i am looking for a mp3 ogg player that has the ability to playback a file at a higher speed preferably without affecting the pitch

87716
ubuntu	linux
it can only install software in a ubuntu system but you can download the updates or new packages in any linux windows or os x

87720
dpkg	apt
this is technically the case becuase the whole apt dpkg database is owned by root

87739
ubuntu	linux
on my case i used play on linux to install a ms-office 2007 in my ubuntu so i could open the pptx files in a correct manner

87744
folder	directory
2 turning the downloads folder into a temporary directory that behaves similarly to tmp deleting old files

87760
pulseaudio	mixer
i used pulseaudio mixer applet for the exact problem described here

87773
dns	spf
using dns an spf record a txt record declares which smtp servers are allowed to send mail from your domain

87773
dns	spf
therefore you must modify the dns records for cgc-instruments.de to include an spf record for the smtp server pre-configured virtual server .

87774
google-chrome	firefox
you should be using firefox web browser the site currently doesn t support google-chrome and other web browsers

87789
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i can find there isn t any nacl plugin for firefox so i can t test the actual applications that failed with google-chrome

87789
google-chrome	firefox
why does firefox play nicely with webgl when google-chrome just wants to sit in the corner

87804
ubuntu	linux
i m using a linux distribution based on ubuntu 10.04 backtrack 5 r1

87840
gentoo	linux
if you want to do a lot of compiling use linux from scratch or gentoo

87863
unity2d	unity3d
if you still think ubuntu is the way and 11.10 is the release to go then you should be for sure using unity2d instead of the default unity3d

87895
post	get
as to sharing your scanner between ubuntu and mac the following forum post may be get you started

87896
put	get
i would have to cycle the router s power toggle off on to get it to come back on and put out a signal again

87903
mouse	keyboard
mouse won t move keyboard doesn t respond flash video is paused the audio usually continues though

87912
switching	screens
however i cannot find a single reference to switching to the login screens without logging out from a terminal or shell script

87912
switching	screens
i would also appreciate suggestions for sleeping the display after switching to the login screens or as one whole script if possible

uninstall	upgrade
i can install uninstall with aptitude apt-get with no error notifications i can even upgrade packages with gnome s update manager but that s not my case

87970
mouse	trackpad
this mouse is very useful and it could be much more if it would be supported like the apple magic trackpad

87972
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	centos
the realtek r8168b network card does not work out of the box in redhat centos fedora or ubuntu instead of loading the r8168 driver modprobe loads the r8169 driver which is broken as can be seen with ifconfig which shows large amounts of dropped packets

ati	nvidia
as said here nvidia has stated they do not currently plan on supporting wayland and i d suspect ati to have a similar stance even if they have not made an announcement about it

88087
chown	chmod
for linux permissions it is chown chmod but i am guessing you are asking about ntfs

88087
chown	chmod
you then re-mount the partition and use chown and chmod

88151
disk	ram
if you decide to do this you should just delete the swap partition and the extended partition that contains it to make way for the ntfs partition to move over then you can create a new swap partition at the end of the disk later if you even want to have swap -- it really isn t needed if you have more than one or two gb of ram

88221
bluetooth	usb
i also have a usb bluetooth 2.1 dongle and when i attach that and use it instead of my internal adapter i get perfect audio quality

ubuntu	debian
libav won which is not surprising since debian ubuntu package maintainer is one of them

88496
ffmpeg	libav
as of dec 18 2011 ffmpeg has at least one point where it works and libav doesn t 2

88572

if you try to create a synchronized folder from something that is not an actual directory inside your home if it is for example a symlink to somewhere else or if it is a subdirectory of a synchronized folder then the creation will fail

88661
disk	ram
your system begins to use swap when the ram becomes overloaded it might be thrashing dumping ram to the disk before you close the heavy applications and then has a hard time recovering

88678
disk	ram
because disk are much slower than ram this can lead to slower response times for system and applications if processes are too aggressively moved out of memory

88704
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have multi-boot with windows 7 linux mint kubuntu and then i was installing ubuntu 11.10 too but during the installation it appears this message

88748
ubuntu	linux
the two most popular in linux are gimp and inkscape both are in the ubuntu repositories

88754
debian	linux
atm i m working around this with samba shares but it baffles me that both a playstation 3 and windows 7 laptop work better together with my debian based media server than my linux desktop in this regard

88755
mouse	keyboard
hitting ctrl - alt - numpad 4 has to be the 4 on the number pad on your keyboard will automatically tile the window to left half of the monitor your mouse is currently on

88755
mouse	keyboard	move	drag
if you want to tile with the mouse you can drag a window to the left or right edge and unity will prompt you to resize the window on the side of that screen however this can get tricky with multiple monitors as there s no hard edge so you have to kind of move towards the edge until it triggers the resize which is why i prefer the keyboard to do this quickly

88757
ubuntu	linux
it describes configuration for windows and linux clients including ubuntu

88760
clang	llvm
how would i go about installing version 3 of clang llvm in ubuntu 10.10

88763

88877
post	get
i can select my layout from the keyboard properties and i can use in on the console following chascon s post but the layout i get when typing is unchanged

88888
daemon	cron
check that you have a cron daemon running

88907
ubuntu	linux
this could be due to loading wrong version of linux kernel image for a version of ubuntu

88909
vim	gedit
i mostly use gedit and vim

88915
chown	sudo
then it had read write issues so i did sudo chown donald dev lp0 and put myself in the lp group

88954
mouse	keyboard
then keyboard accessibility under mouse buttons

88954
mouse	keyboard
another way is using ctrl-shift-numlock that is supposed to be the key combo that will let you move the cursor with the keyboard you can control the mouse from keyboard

my experience is that you can run any x86 software on an 64bit system

88978
jobs	cron
you can automate the backups using cron jobs

89010
disk	ram
in terms of cpu type ram hard disk those wont be the issue

89010
ubuntu	linux
the most probable reason you are seeing many intel bases laptops supported by ubuntu or ubuntu friendly is probably that there are not drivers required to install out of the box for a system with an intel graphics chipset and the driver works mostly all cases very well with intel working hard on supporting linux

89018
chown	chmod
chown also has a -r recursive flag but to make future created files in a directory inherit the same group ownership rather than the creating user s group the setgid bit should be added to the directory with chmod

89027

i then did an upgrade of the ubuntu to the latest 11.10 versioning but this did not work well

89526
versioning	upgrade
you can try to upgrade your graphics card you can try an older versioning of ubuntu or you can try to install the driver

89529

89771

ubuntu	linux
i recommend grabbing a scratch computer one you can erase and doing cycles of linux installs on it with ubuntu and for contrast other distributions

89859
ubuntu	mint
do not let the name fool you you these scripts work just fine on any .deb system including mint and ubuntu

89895

kubuntu uses kde graphical environment

89952
ubuntu	linux
i downloaded the linux driver for my card from ati.com and put it onto a flash drive that i have formatted to fat but cant seem to work out how to load it into ubuntu now as i thought that if i can manually install the driver maybe that would be a fix

89952
ubuntu	linux
i believe that if ati site gives me that linux driver for my card then it should be possible to fix ubuntu

89953
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu is ubuntu with kde

89953
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome

90397

i know i may have to do a complete new installation unless i leap frog on a 10.10 upgrade or something so i don t mind that as long as i can conserve some of my settings and bookmarks etc

90399
disk	ram
i ve found that emptying swap can help a lot on systems with slow disk and limited ram

90422

if you get any error message with those first 3 commands post back or use pastebin

90442

if you want to share folders between ubuntu computers may i suggest to use a native linux solutionâ

something must have gone wrong with that detection or you may have had less ram at the time of installation and upgrade later

90635
filesystems	ntfs
any filesystems with journaling is less prone to corruption including ntfs

90639
filesystems	ntfs
to check a linux filesystems you can use fsck ntfs should be better checked by windows itself

90654
ubuntu	linux
i ve just made the switch from red hat enterprise linux to ubuntu server and need to do network configuration with static ip addresses multiple ethernet interfaces channel bonding for redundancy a bridge for vms etc

90656

with debian ubuntu you can run commands from that file with pre-up post-up pre-down post-down

90656
post	get
if you have a more specific question or get stuck post your rhel config and we can help you convert it

90678
ati	nvidia
but imo i would go buy nvidia as their drivers are more stable on both windows and linux as compared to ati but if you have a hackintosh compatible hardware and plan to build a hackintosh in future go for ati

90683
xfce	gnome
metacity and xfvm options addressed respectively to gnome classic and xfce

90703
min	max
this would help in trying to find a resolution that works on both monitors and in cases like a mini netbook and a huge tv it would solve issues like having max 800x600 in one monitor and min 1024x768 in the other

90724

i made a post in the forum detailing a fairly straight forward way to get the boot loader to work and finish the installation

i do not want any links to debian ubuntu packaging instructions

90769
put	get
make a shell script and put your commands inside it pass the password only once as argument and inside the script use 1 to get your password

90797
installation	downgrade
the process actually downgrade a custom php installation and i had a heck of a time getting the dependencies right to recompile to the newer version

90798
versioning	upgrade
you can not choose to upgrade to new versioning in the newer release

90826
ubuntu	linux
i realize that the linux and ubuntu culture tends to install new software from binaries but having used bsd ports within both bsd and mac os x i find it very simple and elegant and the idea of compiling from source on demand with all dependencies figured out for you is very powerful

90839
ubuntu	linux
most linux distributions ubuntu included distribute packages as binaries

90839
dpkg	apt
so what you would do on ubuntu is download the source code from the ubuntu repositories make any modifications needed build a package and install it with apt dpkg

90839
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
apt-build will build from source and is probably the best way of achieving what you want on ubuntu or debian or mint ...

90843

i highly recommend this laptop as an ubuntu linux machine

gui s of eclipse emacs or vim do not work on my comp

90881
vim	emacs
when i run these programs the processor usage shoots up but the program gui fails to load completely for e.g in emacs vim - the cursor never appears

90881
vim	emacs
i think its a gui issue because the non-gui versions emacs -nw and vi vim work normally without any issues

90936
versioning	upgrade
attention you should only use the old-release archive if you have no possibility to upgrade to a newer versioning because you won t get any security updates using these old archives

90941
ubuntu	linux
the only problem with this setup is every time you update grub you need to change boot grub grub.cfg as it sees arch s linux image as main ubuntu s latest linux image and sends ubuntu in previous versions

90948
cvs	svn
also using a versioning system like svn or cvs would be better you can commit the code changes and those changes will be transferred using ssh

90953
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux replaces mbr record with its own boot loader

90972
ubuntu	linux
i have a windows server and all the clients are linux based ubuntu 11.10 i want to set up group domain policy on my network

90981
ubuntu	linux
generally speaking you re best off with hardware support from the most recent linux kernel you can get which means that you may get better results from installing ubuntu oneiric ocelot 11.10 than with natty narwhal 11.04 which will mean a more up to date set of software all round

91017
versioning	upgrade
you never mentioned which ubuntu versioning you used before you upgrade to 11.10

91024
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu like debian strives to comply with the lsb through the alien program but is not believed to be fully compliant

91052
folder	directory
if you ve downloaded the file and saved it to the downloads directory you need to make sure that you run the commands from that folder

91052
folder	directory
since you ve saved it into the downloads directory which is located in your home folder execute cd downloads first

91054
chown	chmod
you can then use chown and chmod on the ntfs partition

91096
freebsd	linux
it runs in a variety of posix environments such as linux android 5 freebsd 6 and others such as proprietary kernels although many of the tools it provides are designed to work with interfaces provided by the linux kernel

91111
ubuntu	freebsd
if you prefer here is a tutorial on dual booting ubuntu and freebsd should work with freenas

91115
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
if you have install mate via the linux mint repository then you will have upgraded many of the core ubuntu packages

91119
installation	upgrade
after the installation of the upgrade everything worked fine for a while

91142
versioning	upgrade
as bodhi.zazen said you can upgrade to a later ubuntu versioning

91151
x86	64bit
my printer canonmp550 doesn t work with i7 x86 64bit under ubuntu 11.10 with

91175
versioning	upgrade
in addition to performing the function of upgrade also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versioning of packages

91183
ubuntu	linux
windows has separate directory trees for each partition but linux ubuntu has one directory tree and your new partition will still be part of that

91204
ubuntu	debian
who am i trusting when i install a package using apt-get install assuming that the package is part of the ubuntu main distribution am i trusting canonical debian or an open source contributor

91205
dpkg	apt
as i understand things apt uses dpkg are there any operations that you can do with dpkg that can t be done with apt

91213
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and ubuntu 11.10 oneiric ocelot so if there is some type of installer that i can double-click that would be great

91225
dpkg	apt
if you run into limitations of apt at least youâ ll already know to look into dpkg

91257
ati	nvidia
phoronix over the last few months have been reporting the development of another api called the gallium 3d state tracker - this is intended to unify the main chipsets - intel ati radeon and nvidia

91322
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and other debian derivatives rely on the .deb package infrastructure

91325
dpkg	apt
apt and dpkg perform different but orthogonal tasks

91325
dpkg	apt
apt keeps track of what packages are available and can do things like download a package and its dependencies and hand them to dpkg to install or check if there are newer versions of the packages you have installed download them and hand them to dpkg to install

91325
dpkg	apt
in other words dpkg handles the low level package management and apt builds on top of it by adding the concept of an archive that contains packages that you may want to download and install

91328
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade my intel hd graphic driver to the 2.16.0 versioning all work fine but awn and gnome pie icon effects is going like these screenshots

91330
ubuntu	debian
you are trusting that canonical compiled the program so it did not have any tampering that is not evident in the source code and that they verified the signature on the source code from the ubuntu developer that uploaded it or that debian did the same for the debian developer who uploaded it if the package came from debian

91361
ubuntu	linux
i am a new linux user after installed ubuntu 11.10 on my laptop

91372
ubuntu	linux
i have a sony vaio p netbook and for several issues graphics driver audio driver and power management i want to install an older version of the linux kernel on ubuntu 11.10 actually its xubuntu that seems to be much more suitable

91372
ubuntu	linux
so i searched for ubuntu kernels and found this link which includes all versions of the linux kernel distributed by ubuntu

91375
switching	screens
also the secondary monitor is a touchscreen and when i plug it in and switching off the actual laptop monitor only then does the secondary monitor s touch screens calibrate properly

91390
xfce	gnome
installing xfce or gnome in ubuntu will pull in extra applications that are normally used in those environments but isn t installed by default in ubuntu

91421
h.264	webm
now that webm is such a popular free alternative to h.264 why isn t support included by default

91502
kde	gnome
gnome as well as kde allow to edit properties of desktop shortcuts on a right-click and setting a option like run in terminal there

91586
keydown	keyup
the command xte keydown alt_l key f1 keyup alt_l works great with easystroke

91589
portrait	landscape
once rotated to portrait mode the stylus responded but not correctly rather sending the mouse off as if the mouse s domain was still in landscape

91595
versioning	upgrade
in addition to the temporary resolve issues - you have a few package management issues that need to be corrected - i m assuming you have tried recently to upgrade from one ubuntu versioning to the next recommended versioning - in your case from natty 11.04 to oneiric 11.10

91598
sudoers	passwd
and enter passwd this message is shown you are not in sudoers file and when i enter

91667
disk	ram
i would bet money that your freezing problem is not due to your ancient ext2 filesystem but that it is related to your hard drive because i bet you are running out of ram and the system is swapping processes out to disk

91670
ubuntu	debian
subsequently this is why in debian changelog you are only allowed to specify one version of ubuntu at a time on the version line for example - note the natty part changes to maverick lucid oneiric hardy etc.

91673
switching	screens
after the asus logo when switching on the pc and pressing f8 to select the usb pen-drive there was the options thing as normal that allows me to select to either boot form the pen-drive or install on the hdd when i do either of these there is a bunch of text on a black background as i would expect but after a few seconds the screens goes blank and the moniter says no signal

91695
ubuntu	linux
maybe this can help you audio2dj with mixxx on ubuntu linux

91762
kde	gnome	hide	show
to hide banshee from the menu s in kde you ll need to change the desktop file to only show the menu item in unity gnome

91805
portrait	landscape
the pixel data is stored as a landscape image and it s marked in metadata as a portrait

91831
cpu	processors
and my computer has an amd apu processors which has gpu + cpu in one

does this mean that i am running an ubuntu kernel based on the upstream linux 3.0.0

91922
ubuntu	linux
i have tried cloning the linux kernel repo and adding the ubuntu repo as a remove but commands like git show-branch ubuntu-3.0.0-14.23 v3.0.14 show these two tags diverging at linux 3.0.4 and i can t see any commits near the tip of the ubuntu tag that indicate a rebase to a new upstream version

92104
ethernet	wireless
i have the same issue and after much research have come to the conclusion that ubuntu doesnt like sharing a wired connection to an xbox etc with a wireless internet connection but what can be done is buying a wireless routher and connecting the xbox to that via ethernet cable and wireless to your laptop pc this should work so ive been told

92119
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade to this versioning without loss of data and reformatting the hard disk

92124

92220
versioning	upgrade
i ve read that if you upgrade your kernel versioning up to the 3.1 branch it won t happen again

92416
ubuntu	debian
how is ubuntu different from debian

i thought this would just change the name - that s all i wanted to do then everything was gone in the original home directory folder for instance when i clicked on any files or pictures on the desktop anywhere it said not found and i got really worried all my stuff was gone but then i found a new folder in the new name that i had created somewhere and that had all my stuff in so i know it is still there

92523
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is a linux distribution

92523
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu uses debian another linux distribution packaging system and apt tools to package and install the tools and applications used in the linux ecosystem more graphically user friendly and better integrated

92607
ssd	sata
apart from the fact that accessing the drive via usb is inherently slower than via sata a normal hdd or especially ssd will be noticeably much faster than an usb drive one cause of your current setup being slower may be partition misalignment

92627
uninstall	upgrade
this means that it won t be easy to uninstall or upgrade your manually installed drivers

92627
chown	sudo
alternatively install the stow package create a directory usr local stow alsa-1.0.24 give yourself write permission on it sudo chown hannibal usr local stow alsa-1.0.24 specify and run make install without sudo

out of curiosity why are you using dsa keys instead of rsa

92960
mp3	ogg
this can best be achieved by running an combination of icecast2 with ices2 for ogg vorbis streams or darkice for mp3

92981
rsa	dsa
i don t want to hear about any kind of keys rsa dsa or any other

92985

93318
vmware	virtualbox
you can use virtualbox which is free or vmware server which is also free

93326
hash	md5
since any two given files are very unlikely to have the same md5 hash sum unless they are exactly the same the md5sum command line program is commonly used to verify download integrity particularly for large files

93326
hash	md5
when using md5sum specifically to check ubuntu .iso integrity you can refer to a list of the correct md5 hash for each image version for all currently supported versions of ubuntu here

93327
hash	md5
md5sum is a command line program used to calculate md5 hash of files and provides a simple way to check the integrity of a download

apt-get update updates the list of available packages and their versioning but it does not install or upgrade any packages

that screenshot is gnome 2 on debian and although you can make ubuntu look somewhat like gnome 2 you can not run gnome 2 on ubuntu

94306
switching	screens
and there is another clue when the flickering occur i switching to tty1 crtl+alt+f1 i found there some char output to the screens

94319
dpkg	apt

disk	ram
however after wiping the disk and install ubuntu 11.10 64 bit the system still detects only 3.1 gb of ram

94377
ubuntu	linux
it appears you are confusing the wubi install with a real installation which would have installed ubuntu on the partition you have labeled as linux

94377
ubuntu	linux
in order to install linux on that partition you actually need to boot ubuntu from the livecd usb and not use the wubi installer which installs inside of windows

94379
ubuntu	linuxmint
the ubuntu and linuxmint fonts look ugly and way to fat

94430
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
also not sure if ubuntu server is most convenient for programming robotics and stuff or if other distros are better for it as mint fedora suse or debian arch and then based on their experience and knowledge i would like to give their opinions regarding this

94451
ubuntu	linux
some like puppy linux are small enough to boot straight from a flash drive and others such as ubuntu offer what you might call an easier to use ui and design though larger in size

94463
kde	gnome
i can t integrate zeitgeist with kde when i use gnome zeitgeist works correct and logs everything what i m doing

94478

94478
ati	nvidia
problem is that vd-pau is essentially nvidia only and the built in graphics are ati based

94495
pull	push
just use bzr to push pull between the two repositories

94498
filesystems	ntfs
disclaimer - i would use a linux native filesystems as ntfs is likely to get complicated and may not work

don t know why just know after installing both mint 11 and then ubuntu 11.10 it is the only way it would remove the softblocked yes

94713
versioning	upgrade
so versioning 2.8 should not be upgrade to 2.9

94717
versioning	upgrade
not only because there is no good way from your end to prevent an upgrade but more importantly because users may want to have both versioning installed during a transition period

94717
ubuntu	debian
historical example apache i don t remember if ubuntu had separate apache 1 and apache 2 at some point but debian definitely did

94731

94734
folder	directory
for as long as i can remember every time i install ubuntu there is a folder in the home directory called templates. i ve always just deleted it but i m curious what s it supposed to be used for and why is it in the default install

94736
ubuntu	linux
i m new to ubuntu and i need help i created a partition for my folder of 2gb but i m determined to stay with linux

94751

ati	nvidia
if you did not install any drivers outside of the ubuntu repositories nvidia ati wireless you should be just fine

pop-up	dialog
in the 2nd menu last entry settings a dialog pop-up

94845
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
if you plan on mounting on windows it would be easiest to use a windows native filesystems on the encypted drive such as fat or ntfs as windows cannot natively read linux filesystems without the use of special drivers

94848
ubuntu	linux
please note i am reasonably new to ubuntu and linux and have also read about patching the kernel but i don t feel confident doing this

94853
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
there seem to be issues with the current chromium build related to this causing the error when saving to ntfs fat filesystems as these don t support chmod

95343
gentoo	linux
on the other hand there are distributions that use a rolling release cycle where packages are continuously updated most famous are gentoo arch linux

95351
installation	upgrade
i have read here and here that it is recommended to have 3 partitions for the desktop installation root home and swap as having a separate home and root can simplify the process if you want to upgrade or reinstall ubuntu if you break something by mistake

95373
ubuntu	linux
my goal is to write a super scripts for java developers that downloads most needed tools onto any linux not just ubuntu and mount potential things that don t need to be reinstalled if you have an existing development host

95380
switching	screens
however i had a problem with bottom menu it was impossible to open it because bottom of the screens was below the physical display and i was not satisfied with the automatization level of that solution too so i wrote a python script to solve my problem and - in general - make it easier to switching to dual-display mode

95519
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu makes it quite easy to adapt the configuration to your needs

95560

software-center is a graphical front-end of advanced packaging tool apt which in turn is a command line front-end of dpkg

95561
ubuntu	linux
i have tascam us-122l since windows is really crappy with this i decided to try linux and ubuntu to be specific

95563
mouse	keyboard
this usually occurs after a mouse movement and during the pause the computer is completely unresponsive to mouse or keyboard

95571
versioning	upgrade
for configuring colors in unity you could upgrade unity to its latest versioning from a ppa

95582
ubuntu	linux
hp doesn t seem to have any linux ubuntu drivers for the wifi for this laptop

95583
ubuntu	debian
the reason you can not use yum on debian ubuntu is because of incompatibility of the packages

95583
gentoo	linux
and if you are going to go with source code better off with arch gentoo or linux from scratch

95586
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the problem is that ubuntu traditionally draws most of its applications from the in-development branch of debian gnu linux â another free operating systemâ and then freezes a snapshot of it for inclusion in a release

95589
move	drag
i am now slightly regretting it since the trackpad is very annoying it only registers when i press quite hard on it and even then the motion is so slow that i must drag me poor finger 3 times to get the pointer to move up or down that tiny screen

95682
sorting	filtering

how to download flash streaming videos from sites like youtube dailymotion vimeo etc

95793
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
it is a colloquial term to differentiate ubuntu as released or officially supported by canonical and other distros that use ubuntu as its base - for example linux mint

95793
ubuntu	linux
other non vanilla ubuntu variants are usually migrated to unix linux stack-overflow

95797
xfce	kde
in a broader sense vanilla ubuntu can refer to ubuntu the os as opposed to any derived os or to ubuntu the os with any of the officially supported desktops kde lxde or xfce but without any third party software that is software from a source other than the official repositories

95811
versioning	upgrade
if you don t want to reinstall everything using a 11.10 iso cd you will have to upgrade to each versioning 10.10 11.04 and then 11.10 from the update center

95816
google-chrome	firefox	ubuntu	linux
since malware virus are next to none on ubuntu and yes i have read up on all of the diffent point of views on both sides of having ubuntu security software or not is google-chrome just as safe on linux or should i stick with firefox

95818
titlebar	window
using window manager settings check custom under window titlebar button layout

95833
mouse	keyboard
until then i do not see the mouse pointer and the keyboard does not work

95834
filesystems	ntfs
it ll be easy to see since it ll likely be the only partition running ntfs as a filesystems

95835
disk	ram
the bottle neck is that you have to write 8 gb of ram to disk worse yet you have to sort through 6 gb of swap to determine which data goes with what

95849
kde	kubuntu
i am using latest kde in kubuntu 11.10 i have ssh keys added protected by a passphrase which is prompted every time i try to establish ssh connection

95853
mouse	keyboard
mouse can move across screen but no clicks work neither does keyboard commands like ctrl+alt+t for terminal

95861

in the file manager nautilus in your home directory display hidden folder to do this temporarily the keyboard shortcut is ctrl+h

95861

lastly copy those folder starting with a period into your new home directory

95867
ubuntu	linux
in general linux ubuntu applications don t use a central resource for certificate authorities so you can follow the directions above and click the import.

kde	gnome
but not unity unity-2d gnome or kde

95932
ubuntu	linux
there is no user guide with this usb modem for linux installation and it is not detected automatically in ubuntu 11.10

i believe that in almost all cases the ethernet connection is preferred over the wireless

95988
chgrp	chmod	sudo	chgrp	chown	sudo	chown	chmod	chown	chgrp
bottom-line you can change the permissions of the file using chmod if you are the owner of that file without root sudo permissions but you cannot change the ownership either user or group using either chown or chgrp of a file even though you are the owner of the file without root sudo permissions

95989
google-chrome	firefox
however it still does not get java to work in google-chrome or firefox

95990
google-chrome	firefox
my system freezes randomly while using google-chrome mozilla firefox

95990
google-chrome	firefox
i have also discovered that while scrolling in firefox google-chrome the cpu usage of firefox google-chrome and gnome-shell increases a lot around 60-80 percent each depending upon the scroll speed

95992
ethernet	wireless
my understanding is that when you are connected to a wired and a wireless connection at the same time your computer will choose the wired ethernet connection

96001
ubuntu	linux
then post your wireless card s info here for more specific help or search for your card s name and the word drivers and ubuntu or linux

96025
folder	directory
if you wish to upload to a different cloud folder you can create a directory on your computer tell ubuntu one to synchronize it and then using the aforementioned upload directory option select that location

96027
xfce	gnome
...however i believe this breaks xfce so this will not work if you re using xfce as well as gnome

96045
kde	gnome
i m looking for an appmenu like this one for kde to be used with gnome or openbox or any other

96045
kde	gnome
i have tried using kde window manager in gnome not very good

96046

some of the confusion might arise because ubuntu uses upstart instead of the traditional linux init system but still supports the old methods

ubuntu	linux
i ve created another 30gb partition to install ubuntu from the free space on my 2â partition but since i m really new to ubuntu and linux i really don t know what to do

96294
folder	directory
they are by convention for configuration files or directory in your home folder with the dot prepended not appended to keep the directory listings cleaner

96299
folder	directory
you cannot sync a folder outside your home directory with ubuntu one directly

96302
jobs	cron
in ubuntu 16.04 and newer cron jobs are slowly being replaced by systemd timers but that s also beyond the scope of the question

96338
ubuntu	linux
on some linux distributions other then ubuntu you have to log off and then log back in as the root account to make system-wide changes

96338
sudo	passwd
if you want to enable the root account for some reason you can do so by running sudo -i and sudo passwd root and setting a passwd for the root account if you prefer handling administrative tasks this way

96343
ubuntu	linux
also like i said i am new to linux ubuntu so please be nice

96346
ubuntu	linux
as an aside ubuntu like most linux distros includes device drivers as kernel modules

96516

96543
ubuntu	linux
more than anything as per my experience with ubuntu or linux you have to have a net connection

96543

if you are doing something in the terminal then do post the command that you are giving or the error messages in case you get any

with the 3.5 precise release both the upstream build system and the packaging at debian and ubuntu have been cleared up enough to make this basically feasable -- if excluding l10n binfilter and mozilla

try alt-f8 then use either the keyboard arrow keys or your mouse touchpad to resize the window

96737
cinnamon	gnome
problems could arise from conflicting configurations in .gnome or other directories as there is a moderate amount of variation in how gnome is implemented on various distributions unity vs gnome-shell vs cinnamon

96751
disk	ram
i mean if it s a faulty disk or bad ram or whatever it is inconceivable that it manifests itself by screwing up just the password

96752
google-chrome	firefox
when i play flash videos in firefox or google-chrome and try to view it in fullscreen mode it stops every second the sound is good but not the video

96790

the laptop wireless connects to my router while the desktop is connected to the laptop with an ethernet wire

97172
ubuntu	linux
this sort of discussion comes up from time to time and imo the best answer is that linux is not windows and at this time the current firewall policy is considered sufficient by the ubuntu developers security team as by default there are no open ports

97287
ubuntu	debian
assuming you re using later version of debian ubuntu or their derived distribution and hence you have grub 2 installed in you system

97287
sudo	passwd
run in terminal sudo update-grub2 enter your sudo passwd when prompted

97329
google-chrome	firefox
although you stated explicitely you will only support the most recent firefox and google-chrome i would not recommend depending on html5 just yet

97329
google-chrome	firefox
and while the tag is supported by google-chrome and firefox afaik there isn t one single browser that completely supports the whole html5 specification

ubuntu 10.04 is certainly installable on the mini 9 i have installed it on one - it was as an upgrade to 9.10 but i would expect a fresh installation to work equally well

if as you gain experience with ubuntu linux you wish a smaller lighter system it is imo far easier to start with a minimal install and build up then start with a standard desktop install and start removing things

on the command line the tool to manipulate bitmap images is imagemagick or graphicsmagick gm is a split of the im project and more actively developed

for ad hoc use where you need to see each image you can use display also from the imagemagick suite or gm display graphicsmagick or shotwell or pinta or many other image viewers with light editing capabilities

97710
ati	nvidia
this is a little leap of faith but if you re trying to improve video playback quality ie stop tearing etc in addition to enabling vblank in your video card settings both nvidia nd ati provide their own proprietry settings managers for this you need to also disable display compositing

97728

generate the key either rsa or dsa

i resolved this using linux mint lisa which is based on ubuntu oneiric by rolling the nvidia driver back to version 173

i would like to ask somebody experienced with linux ubuntu to take a look at this and to do some remarks

97867
ubuntu	debian
rolling releases by definition goes against what ubuntu fights for every 6 months basically before each release packages are imported from debian unstable continuously and merged to the ubuntu repos with modifications done for ubuntu

97895

if you are not getting a response from the local keyboard or mouse your only other option would be to try to ssh from another box

a slight improvement over the shared ntfs data partition recipe suggested by bodhi.zazen is to set up home on an ext partition mount an ntfs partition at say mount disk and then replace directory the user s home folder with symlinks to directory on the ntfs partition

i remember i ran few chmod chown command which cause me this issue

98677
chown	chmod
i also lost rights on .bashrc file which i think happened after i ran those chmod chown commands

98686
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
sudo chown -r ramiz home ramiz and sudo chmod -r 755 home ramiz should do the trick

98686

look in to cinnamon which is a gnome shell that is being written by the linuxmint team

98946
ubuntu	debian
it is possible at least on debian squeeze and probably therefore on ubuntu which tends to be more recent than debian to backport debian gcc packages

99004
systemtap	perf
i also suggest you become familiar with the kernel trace frameworks out there like ftrace perf and systemtap

versioning	upgrade
apt-get upgrade is restricted to the case where packages are to be replaced by newer versioning but no package needs to be added or removed

99039
versioning	upgrade
a new versioning of firefox for instance should be installable with apt-get upgrade

99039

however apt-get upgrade will refuse to work when there are additions or removals required by the updated versioning

using opensuse boot loader i can t seem to get the boot menu configured to start ubuntu

99043
lvm	btrfs
if your raid5 is partitioned and currently lvm is using dev md1p1 as the pv then you can shrink the pv shrink the partition and create a new partition using the free space to use for btrfs

99043
umount	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
it would be much easier safer and faster to simply create a new lv using whatever space is currently free in the vg and format it with btrfs then transfer some files shrink an existing lv with resize2fs assuming it s ext4 and it will need to be umount to do this and lvresize then add the space to the btrfs lv with lvresize and tell btrfs to use the new space with btrfs filesystems resize max path to btrfs-mount

99046
ubuntu	opensuse
grub then makes the filesystems of ubuntu opensuse and windows 7 available and looks to a file called boot grub grub.cfg which tells it what operating systems are on the computer and how to boot them

99104
kde	kubuntu
you need to add the kubuntu backport repository to get the last version of kde

mouse	keyboard
i have noticed so keyboard mouse hanging and other issues since i bought my new computer and installed ubuntu 11.10

99151
folder	directory
before you reinstall you should probably back up the settings from some of your programs this can easily be done by grabbing folder from etc and all the content from your user directory not just the stuff you can see in nautilus

99189
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse do not know or care how much entropy is available and a lack of entropy should not cause anything to hang other than generating new cryptography keys

99189
mouse	keyboard
in fact normal use of the keyboard and mouse add to the entropy pool

99206
hide	show
i want to be able to hide some search results from dash and only show them when i click on that particular lens

99421

so to keep it short if i would to change my system now should i go for an nvidia video card or should i stick to my ati

99428
ati	nvidia
it does seem like nvidia has a reputation for better linux compatibility than ati

99440

also when you install kde it also changes the shutdown and startup screen to kubuntu instead of ubuntu

99759
ubuntu	linux
does compiling a downloaded linux kernel e.g 3.2 make the os e.g ubuntu faster on that specific machine

99868
ubuntu	linux
if you re using the stock h_affine binaries for linux then you might want to consider compiling them for the version of ubuntu you use

99868

remember that ubuntu is not the only linux and linux is not the only unix-style operating system

99869

i can do sudo apt-get update without problem but the upgrade does not work neither does the installation of any package sudo apt-get upgrade or sudo apt-get install emacs simply returns the prompt back and nothing happens

99890
sudo	passwd
you can t get rid of sudo the way you think but you can explicitly define what users are allowed to do all the way from disallowing sudo through to requiring passwd for particular commands

99895

telnet and ftp are two very old protocols that aren t recommended unless you absolutely have to use them

100442
versioning	upgrade
it is possible that you can install it in your versioning of ubuntu from a ppa but i would rather recommend that you wait until you re comfortable with it and upgrade to 12.04

100443
ftp	telnet
unless you re using something like an old palm smartphone where it s just too hard to find a ssh client there is no benefit to using telnet and ftp rather than ssh and sftp

100477

for telnet it is telnetd and for ftp it is ftpd

maybe you know about it but as a side note to everyone who might read this answer most ubuntu packages are copied from debian repositories - so if debian developers released version 5.8p1 seven times releasing it to repositories each time they have included their changes and this is the first time ubuntu developers have released it with their changes the resulting version number will be 5.8p1-7ubuntu1

100892

daemons	systemd
the cheapest but much more tricky time-consuming and extremely overkill for the standard user method would be to set up the server as a gateway box and install configure a dhcp daemons to assign ips to the individual computers and to give the server box its own 10.10.x.x ip address for the other systemd to access it

if ubuntu is based on debian how is it more updated

104287
ubuntu	debian
all debian packages will work on ubuntu

104287
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
all ubuntu packages will work on linux mint based on ubuntu

104299
ubuntu	debian
typically during their development cycle ubuntu imports source packages from debian unstable sid

104299
ubuntu	debian
after ubuntu releases there s a big sync up back with debian and the process repeats

104299
ubuntu	debian
both debian stable and ubuntu take debian unstable - testing - and then make stable releases based off of that

104299
ubuntu	debian
the major difference between the processes is that ubuntu is time-based importing and making freezes based on the schedule and goals for that release whereas debian cycles at a slower rate and doesn t have a strict we need to release regularly goal

104299
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu will also sometimes take things that are important to its users and package those directly sometimes submitting those back to debian if appropriate

104299
ubuntu	debian
the past few releases have been much quicker running about 1.5-2 years between - about the same interval as ubuntu lts releases but since the schedule isn t the same the debian release may have newer software than the most recent ubuntu lts release or vice versa

104299
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu packages are often binary compatible programs built on one distribution can be copied to the other and will run successfully

104299
ubuntu	debian
but this relies on having the same libraries available that the package was built against which is not always the case either between an ubuntu release and a debian release or between two successive releases of the same distribution

104299
ubuntu	debian
also there s a lot more to distribution integration than just having the right libraries so even if the program in the package has everything it needs to be run the package could fail to install or run correctly because of any number of differences between the distributions an ubuntu package may not be usable on debian because it requires upstart for example

104299
ubuntu	debian
in general if you think the packaging should be the same between debian and ubuntu it s still easiest to rebuild the binary packages for the exact toolchain of your release

104299
ubuntu	debian
every once in a while the debian and ubuntu releases line up where we can share things like a gcc libc6 or python version or whatever

104299
ubuntu	debian
this is why the toolchain discussions at the ubuntu developer summit usually take into account the state of debian at the time

104304
switching	screens
however when i switching to dual-monitor using nvidia s twinview these indicators just the whitelisted ones - not the dropbox google reader system load sound workspace ones that you can install using the repositories move to the middle of the screens and obscure the window name in the top panel images below

vmware	virtualbox
then you may want to look into a vmware or virtualbox solution instead

104315
mouse	trackpad
you should be back to your old trackpad driver and see it appear in the mouse and touchpad settings of system settings

104336
versioning	upgrade
whenever you upgrade a development versioning you should first read and understand the changes

104336

this will become less of an issue in future versioning since â â thanks to btrfs â you ll be able to just undo the upgrade or even boot into a previous versioning of the os

104454
vmware	virtualbox
if you are wanting to use a guest os and not have to set multiple partitions i would use virtualbox or vmware

reason being is because you would have to boot to existing file system in order for folder directory to be accessible in the first place

the answer is to make new destination folder your ubuntu one directory on the computer then point the phone app at these new folder on both phones

install it either through the software center or by writing sudo apt-get install libcurl3 in a terminal window it will ask for your passwd to be able to install the program onto the system

105579
ubuntu	debian
that said up to libreoffice3.4 oneiric both debian and ubuntu used the go-oo build system which is scary for the uninitiated and perhaps even more so for the initiated

google-chrome	firefox
the worst case scenario for twitter is that someone sends spam with your account but they won t have access to sensitive data however if you store passwords in google-chrome firefox - that s an entierly different matter and the hackers cannot steal your password or change it

105954
google-chrome	firefox
at the end of the day exploiting g-o-a might not be that valuable unless you re actually targeting a specific person you know runs gnome since most people i dare to say stores their passwords in firefox ie google-chrome which both should be less secure and more common - like telling a child not to steal candy from an open candy jar and then go away shopping for an hour

x86	64bit
this is for 64bit drivers but probably the same solution applies to the 32-bit version by just using x86 instead of x64 in filenames

108824

it means that you may need separate window manager for the display and you may have to provide or share mouse and keyboard

it will create a very poor impression about ubuntu and the rest of the linux community

109108
apt	juju
but the idea is that it would work like apt if you did a juju deploy wordpress it would know that you needed mysql or another database and give you some recommendations

109128
installation	upgrade
and in the future always back up your files before any major software installation or upgrade

109128
versioning	upgrade
additionally keep in mind you can upgrade ubuntu versioning from within ubuntu -- you don t need the cd

109134
ubuntu	linux
obviously no partition exists on the drive - that s my understanding and my knowledge of unix linux ubuntu is limited

109206
folder	directory
just open your home directory in nautilus right-click in the folder not on any of the files choose properties then the permissions tab and set the owner permissions to create and delete files

109213
google-chrome	firefox
flashs on websites are shown without any problem on both firefox and google-chrome

there s another way in ubuntu i can make .deb files of the headers and the linux if i transfer only those two files to the server i think i can install the new kernel using dpkg

it s mainly a debian ubuntu thing to have bash patched to specifically look for and source etc bash.bashrc when starting bash interactively

vmware	virtualbox
anyway if you want that much to run or test your programs on windows in a linux machine and only if you have a pretty powerful computer you can use a virtual machine like virtualbox or vmware

geany aptana which is actually intended for web development and codeblocks are not good when you try them all i assure you

109642
debian-based	ubuntu
in ubuntu and other debian-based systems by default root user has no password set so it is impossible to log in directly as root or to become root by using su command

109642
sudo	passwd
instead ubuntu uses sudo command which allows much more flexible management of permissions - users can perform administrative tasks without knowing root passwd

109646

my goal is that if suspend to both is not supported a behaviour something like suspend to ram and when battery is low suspend to disk

i m new to ubuntu linux and i d like to create a similar partitioning situation as i had on my old windows machine

i can also install another linux distribution alongside ubuntu which will share the home directory

i went back from ubuntu 11.10 to linux mint 9 because of stability and responsiveness

well i just made a second partition and i use more the ubuntu 11.10 than the mint 9 but i can t really realize why.

109702

if ssd is the master drive than you can use easybcd from neowin for windows 7 to add a linux entry so you can use windows boot menu for accessing the ubuntu easy way

it seems the question has morphed to how to configure sudo gksu gksudo to use the second users passwd

109839
sudo	passwd
this will configure sudo to ask for the user passwd

109839

the problem with this is that you will have to first set a root passwd as sudo will ask you for the root passwd to run commands

your command should be as followed you need to replace the path dir and name of the folder you want to copy move

ati	nvidia
i don t have any nvidia or ati graphic card but only with intel onboard graphics display the chipset should be intel h67 with sandy bridge

117066

versioning	upgrade
while we are taking about installing gedit-dash lets upgrade to the latest stable versioning of gedit 3.2.6 this may take 10 min or less

117124
ubuntu	debian
it doesn t look like they provide a debian package which you would install with dpkg and modelsim not being free open source software is not available in the ubuntu archives so apt-get install won t work to install it

117133

chmod 777 wouldn t change permissions on tmp though unless the command actually had the -r switch too

mouse	keyboard
m trying to install 11.10 on my mid 2011 imac but it doesn t seem to recognize my apple wireless keyboard or my magic mouse

117251
folder	directory
try removing the .pulse directory in your home folder then reboot

117277
move	drag
in 12.04 it s leaving the window behind and the mouse appears to be grabbing nothing but i m still holding onto the window and i can still move and place it within the workspace or indeed the previous workspace as it won t appear in the desired place until i drag the mouse all the way to the edge of the screen

117316
sudo	passwd
if i log in as the standard user when i use sudo from command line it asks for that users passwd which doesn t work because that user has no passwd and isn t admin

117316
sudo	passwd
how do i make sudo always ask for admin passwd

117323

sudo asks for the users passwd and then checks if this user is a sudo user

117327

117414
ethernet	wireless
how do i share an ethernet connection through wireless in xubuntu

117416
kde	kubuntu
for context i recently installed kde 4.8 sc onto kubuntu 11.10 using ppas

117416
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
this linux mint upgrade will be a move from gnome and mgse to kde so that will probably complicate things at bit compared to something like upgrading kubuntu 11.10 to kde 4.8

117418
filesystems	ntfs
i have had the same issue ntfs filesystems read-only after upgrading to oneiric

117418
filesystems	ntfs
if the filesystems is still read-only install ntfs-config and run it to check if ntfs support is properly configured

117425
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
see man mount for options or identify the filesystems ntfs fat if you need assistance

117431
filesystems	ntfs
fat32 is currently the most universal filesystems and ntfs is starting to gain write support on most systems

117433
sudo	passwd
then do the sudo passwd user

117468
kde	kubuntu
on the kde bug tracker or the kubuntu one

117473
skype	voicemail
skype supports an easy-to-set up voicemail system

117473
skype	voicemail
one convenient benefit of setting up skype voicemail is that your audio messages â both your greeting and the incoming messages people leave you â are not stored on your computer but instead are stored remotely on skype s central servers

117473
skype	voicemail
before you can use skype voicemail you have to start your setup and record the voicemail greeting that your callers will hear

117498
jobs	cron
for example could i set the gui emacs version as the default text editor and use it to edit cron jobs crontab -e

117501
switching	screens
you can keep multiple screens open kind of like tabs and it has easier to remember shortcuts for attaching detaching switching between screens etc

mint and ubuntu no matter how closely related they are or aren t as the case might be are still two different operating systems

117646
debian	linux
see the debian gnu linux faq for details

117649
xfce	gnome
i don t have a linux box booted at the moment so i can t provide specific instructions - but gnome and probably xfce maintain a keyring of credentials

117664
vlc	mkv
i have a video in mkv format that shows two identical separate videos together and not one over the other in vlc

117690
xfce	gnome
using this command to install will not bring in all the gnome dependencies that are not needed for xfce

117721
ubuntu	linux
i m extremely new to ubuntu and the linux environment in general so i could probably be doing something stupid or not realizing how to do it or its working and i don t realize it - so i just want to apologize for that in advance

117730
ubuntu	linux
boot-repair is a simple tool to repair frequent boot issues you may encounter in ubuntu like when you can t boot ubuntu after installing windows or another linux distribution or when you can t boot windows after installing ubuntu or when grub is not displayed anymore some upgrade breaks grub etc

117757
ubuntu	linux
this question is similar to this one what unique features has ubuntu brought to the linux community

117757
ubuntu	linux
but in this case it is directed towards what has ubuntu contributed to the official linux kernel

117757
ubuntu	linux
i have seeing a small percent of companies and groups that have contributed to the linux kernel but what i want to know is since the beginning of ubuntu till now what has ubuntu contributed to the linux kernel in regards to any aspect of the kernel

117775
ubuntu	debian
i had a dual boot-able system with ubuntu 12.04 and debian

117775
ubuntu	linux
all i really want is ubuntu on one partition and of course the linux swap

117778
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to download adobe flash and i am new to linux and ubuntu

117876
geany	scite	geany	gedit
just to update as i added bounty it s not just gedit but also in scite error is raised but not in geany as geany executes python scripts through terminal

117885
flac	wma
to convert wma to flac you could try soundconverter a graphical application but it allows to add multiple files and directories

117886
folder	directory
move above folder to the â .iconsâ directory

117904
kde	gnome
hey guys i am new to ubuntu i have installed ubuntu 11.10 with gnome and i am not so happy with unity i want to install kde plasma can i install kde plasma on ubuntu or i have to download entire os again to have kds plasma desktop

117905
mp3	flac
though flac playback support in portable audio devices and dedicated audio systems is limited compared to formats like mp3 or uncompressed pcm flac is supported by more hardware devices than competing lossless compressed formats like wavpack

117924
google-chrome	firefox
i m using ubuntu 11.04 and have installed both mozilla firefox and google-chrome

117924
google-chrome	firefox
so i tried to completely uninstall firefox and google-chrome but nothing changed when reinstalling

117931
ubuntu	linux
i am relatively new to ubuntu linux and i am struggling to figure out the basic set-up of hosting a domain name at home with apache2

117938
ubuntu	debian
afaik every patch comes with an the author s associated email which allows to know the origin of it canonical.com debian.org so there is a difference between debian and ubuntu in this matter

117949
folder	directory
also my hdd directory has a bunch of extra folder in them and they appear to be ubuntu related although it is no longer installed

117952
lan	localhost
this same setup can be used to make a fake development site on localhost if you make an entry in your hosts file on any machine that will access it assigning a name to the ip either localhost or the ip address of the server on the lan

117968
ubuntu	linux
as a fan of ubuntu and linux this bothers me

117975
ubuntu	linux
it s only the unity dash which seems to be slow when typing characters but that s nothing to do with linux - just some inefficient coding on the part of the ubuntu devs i guess

117986
ssl	https
ssl tls traffic https should not use any proxy

118003
ubuntu	opensuse
my question stems from the fact that i could use my synaptics clickpad perfectly in opensuse but cannot in ubuntu 12.04

118017
pop-up	dialog
this is the buffer dialog pop-up that you saw

118093
xfce	gnome
that works in all linux desktops that i ve tried whether it be unity gnome shell xfce lxde etc

118115
ubuntu	linux
i started to use linux ubuntu not a while ago and i am already addicted to it

118125
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	linux
before the upgrade you should make sure the linux metapackage is installed it always depends on the latest official kernel for your ubuntu versioning

118125
uninstall	upgrade
i would also recommend to uninstall your custom kernel and perform the upgrade with the 11.10 default 3.0 kernel

118152
hide	show
then i press super + d to hide all normal windows show desktop

118171
kubuntu	gnome
i have a kubuntu 12.04 system to which i added gnome unity but i m now wanting to remove gnome as i don t think i ll ever use it

118172
versioning	upgrade
use sudo apt-get upgrade to update all packages to the new versioning

118204
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	gnome
i ve also noticed that the second example below seems to work in xfce but not in cinnamon gnome 3

118211
filesystems	ntfs
don t get fooled into using something like ntfs between the two the linux support has issues supporting write and can corrupt the filesystems

118215
google-chrome	firefox
can anyone point me towards how i would install firefox 32 alongside 64 or google-chrome 32 bit alongside chromium 64 bit .

118218
xfce	gnome
the difference in memory usage between gnome panel and unity is more noticeable in my experience but you can reinstall gnome panel or try a lighter desktop like lxde xfce etc

118251
mouse	keyboard
i have a media center with a keyboard but no mouse

118282

118385
debian	linux	debian	mint
i came across this thread as because i was looking to install linux mint debian edition on a flash drive and installing on compressed btrfs from the get-go

118406
ethernet	wireless
i remove the wireless card and used ethernet to see if the problem was the that but i got a freeze after doing that

118457
sudo	passwd
type passwd you don t have to type sudo passwd and shouldn t

118464
disk	ram
when you have a lot of memory and only small process memory footprint it is good that your ram is used as disk cache as it improves system responsiveness

118464
disk	ram
on most machines depending on ram size after a while nearly the whole memory will be in use either for processes or as disk cache

118464
disk	ram
swap space is virtual memory memory on disk rather than ram

118483
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
allow your user to run the command via sudo without a passwd by editing etc sudoers

118483
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
obviously replace the username and path to command with real values stick that in there and then try sudo -k path to command the -k just means it ll ask for your passwd if it doesn t know any better - it won t ask if your sudoers edit was correct

118511
ubuntu	linux
i bought a new laptop with no os and decided to try to linux ubuntu for the first time in my life

118561
ubuntu	linux
is there an rss reader for linux ubuntu that syncs with google reader

118613
versioning	upgrade
upgrade will refuse to add or remove packages and sometimes the new versioning of a package requires new packages to be installed or old ones to be removed

118623
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade option is used only to update the packages already installed on your machine to a newer versioning

118623
versioning	upgrade
apt-get dist-upgrade will not only upgrade all of the currently installed packages on your system but also handle the dependency changes for new versioning of packages

118627
versioning	upgrade
just looking to know what the latest downloadable versioning upgrade of ubuntu will provide 64 bit support

118631
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r everydayuser everydayusergroup var www

118635
versioning	upgrade
12.04lts and further lts releases are planned to have upgrade both for the desktop and server versioning for 5 years after release date

118635
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to new versioning of ubuntu are and always will be free of charge

118656
ubuntu	debian
you can either download the appropriate fixparts debian file from sourceforge or install the full gptfdisk package for your version of ubuntu see the downloading gpt fdisk from obs section of this page

118659
ethernet	wireless
i have an ethernet cable coming into my pc and i have a usb wireless adapter

118669
width	height
reduce the width and the height parameters if that is including your 2nd screen

118696
kde	gnome
both gnome and kde provide gui utilities for customizing settings beyond these defaults if you like

118798
dvd	flac
the problem is that it will play as a dvd in a dvd player like vlc or m player even if you get the right codecs installed i used audio extraction well to extract the 24 bit 96000hz music files which can be played by winamp which has support for 24 96000 5.1 flac

118842
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade to a newer versioning

118850
folder	directory
in both cases the individual files and folder are visible in the directory

118877
versioning	upgrade
if this also does not work you could attempt to install ubuntu 11.10 or wait until april 26th and install ubuntu 12.04 as an upgrade versioning might solve your problem

118891
uninstall	upgrade
you shall try to uninstall the packet and re-install it when the upgrade is done gnome-shell is available in the repository in oneiric

118898
google-chrome	firefox
firstly i thought that it is just for google-chrome and tried firefox it also closes itself and one thing more i tried desktop programs such as image viewer it also closes itself.i restarted it but there is no changing.what can do this

118942
ftp	smb
i have done that with ftp before but now smb is also needed

118958
dpkg	apt
afaik dpkg doesnot resolve dependencies apt does

119038
kde	gnome
i downloaded the binary chmod-ed it and it says i need gnome keyring or kde wallet whick i already used

119044
subnet	packets
per your interfaces settings you need to let the kernel do network address translation to route packets across these subnet

119063
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
the sudo command uses your passwd and you have to be authorized in the etc sudoers file

119063
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if you authorize people with sudo you just update the sudoers file to add or remove people and they only have to remember their own passwd

119065
mouse	keyboard
console keyboard managers are more keyboard-friendly it is possible to navigate select files perform file operations without using mouse

119080
versioning	upgrade
the latest kernel versioning any user is supposed to use in ubuntu is updated automatically via the update manager so no action is normally required by user regarding kernel upgrade

119084
ubuntu	linux
as you ve seen ubuntu does provide versions of the linux kernel but not always as fast as they are released upstream you can always compile the 3.3.1 kernel yourself but that may be more effort than you were looking for

119121
ssdp	upnp
the only other traffic was the odd arp request for the router and ssdp upnp broadcasts from the router

119149
versioning	upgrade
update manager won t upgrade it but if i go to synaptic and use ctrl+e force versioning it prompts to remove all of the following packages

119186
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
it s because windows can t read filesystems other than fat or ntfs and your hard drive doesn t have mbr anymore

119193
put	get
as such this is better addressed as a feature request and i would look at the unity get involved page for ideas on how best to help and put your idea forward

119205
mouse	keyboard
i use synergy to control both of my desktops from the same keyboard and mouse

119253
bash	zsh

119299
pop-up	dialog
it catches all keystrokes and pop-up a login dialog

119325
srt	subtitle
so given a film in a format eg mp4 and a subtitle as something like a srt how can i combine them into something my tv can play

119336
vmware	virtualbox
another thing you can do is run the daily build as a virtual machine virtualbox vmware etc. and set it up as you normally would extra repositories run updates etc.

119348
ubuntu	debian
for packages that are on debian based distributions such as ubuntu security patches are back-ported into the current release

119349
versioning	upgrade
try yo install am early versioning if it works then upgrade to latest versioning also you can try a x86 versioning

ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu 11.10 on the kernel linux 3.0.0-17-generic x86_64

dvd	3gp
you can for example convert mpeg s flv s and mov s into avi s or dvd vcd format or mpeg or 3gp etc. all at once

119630
mp4	h.264
so until now this is the only way to convert the video into other formats avi mp4 h.264 3gp and all other popular video formats are supported by xilisoft so used it and enjoy

119640
ubuntu	linux
that video demonstrates installing the linux version of matlab under ubuntu

119646
nautilus	fstab
nautilus doesn t use fstab for mounting devices

119706
swt	swing
the main difference with swing is that you need to ship the right swt jar for the right platform x86_64

119715
mouse	keyboard
i have a running win7 system with wireless keyboard and mouse

119715
mouse	keyboard
if i install ubuntu or any other system i will not be able to use this keyboard and mouse

filesystems	btrfs
photorec does not explicity support btrfs but it works filesystems agnostic

119901
ubuntu	linux
i want to create a desktop environment for ubuntu and linux

119904
bluetooth	usb
i find that to usually be less of a hassle than mtp although it also tends to be slower since it has to go over the network or bluetooth instead of usb

119920
filesystems	btrfs
issue the following commands which will create a raid-1 btrfs filesystems over dev sda1 and dev sdb1 labeling it raid1

119920

119920
filesystems	btrfs
sudo btrfs filesystems df

119969
versioning	upgrade
edit i have upgrade the kernel to versioning 3.2.0 and still no wireless

ubuntu 11.10 and other debian based distributions work best with deb files

120018

rpm files are mainly used in fedora redhat based distributions

120019

ubuntu like debian on which ubuntu is based uses .deb packages

120019

i also recommend doing all your partitioning with the partitioning tool of ubuntu 11.04 it seems to be the most sane option...even alerts you about hidden unused and or empty partitions so you can recover and ensure you are within the 4 bootable partitions range required by refit to boot both linux and or windows

you can fake it by editing the etc hosts files on all the machines to be correct if you haven t set up orchestra s built in dnsmasq server to do dhcp and dns which is the simplest method but requires a dedicated network for your managed machines since it would fight with an existing dhcp server

folder	directory
once you have drive2 mounted create folder on that hard drive partition where you want to store your videos and downloads and then create softlinks or symlinks to those folder in your home directory

versioning	upgrade
the error message you got from the update manager about needing a partial upgrade is that some of the updated packages want to pull in dependencies that are not currently installed which is not particularly surprising when the new packages are from a new distribution versioning

ubuntu 12.04 should fix the wifi problem as it has the newer linux kernel 3.2

vmware	virtualbox
i have some experience with xen vmware and virtualbox

124951
vmware	virtualbox
vmware and virtualbox more or less provide the same features and i decided to go with virtualbox because it is available via ubuntu software center

124954

you should always install using from end of dpkg like apt to resolve dependency if any

if you see a lot swap usage the disk may be relieved a bit by adding more ram

125170
disk	ram
more ram is useful if you are having lockups or sudden high disk activity as your system is using swap as it has run out of ram. sometimes it uses swap even with lots of free ram but that is not harmful it will help you with processing large amounts of bulky data as will a cpu upgrade

125198

there are even weird setups or not-so-weird embedded setups not running ubuntu but this isn t distribution-specific where linux is booted from another operating system where the kernel isn t stored in a place that s accessible by linux
