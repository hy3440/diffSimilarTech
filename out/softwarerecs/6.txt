translation	localization
localization management tools typically assume that every ui string has an id and they will check if there are previously translation strings with the same text and id when the translator runs into a new string

34257
translation	localization
besides there are also differences with regard to available quality checks hot keys string length issues that are typical for localization and not so much for non-ui translation

34257
translation	localization
having said that most translation environments offer some kind of support for both types of usage but localization management tools like sdl passolo or alchemy catalyst are better suited for ui localization than for translation of long texts

34257
translation	localization
for web apps desktop apps and server applications a localization management tool would be the better choice web sites may work better in a translation management tool and print publications could be tricky

since the matter of your question is about the need of a tool that allows you to get side-by-side printing handling long lines issues so that they don t get cut off i can tell you that unfortunately the standard printing features of diffmerge do act same as winmerge or maybe even worse but if you register i m not so i can t actually test you can use a feature that let s you export a s-b-s file diff to html and i think that might solve your problem
